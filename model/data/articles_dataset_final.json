Shanmugam said. This comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza which began on Oct 7, when Hamas fighters launched an attack in Israel, killing around 1,400 people there. Israel retaliated by bombing Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry saying that more than 10,000 have died so far, including more than 4,000 children. Mr Shanmugam said the harmony in Singapore is precious, and everyone will have to play a part to uphold the peace. This despite some comments made recently that religious leaders should not be involved in such issues, he said. Said Mr Shanmugam: \u201cI am at a loss to understand why some think this. This is not how we have the peace and harmony that we have today in Singapore.\u201d He was speaking to about 100 guests and members of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), and religious leaders, at the screening of a locally produced film, Technologies Of The Soul, at One Raffles Quay on Wednesday. It is a documentary about religion and tradition within Singapore\u2019s evolving technological society. Mr Shanmugam pointed out that after the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the then Mufti of Singapore, Mr Syed Isa Semait, condemned the act and emphasised that suicide bombings are against the teachings of Islam. In 2014, Singapore Archbishop William Goh issued guidance on how to pray for victims of the escalating violence in Gaza, as well as how to help with financial aid. That year, Israel invaded Gaza over a period of 50 days. More than 2,200 Palestinians, 66 Israeli soldiers and five Israeli civilians were killed. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite usual, and indeed important, for religious leaders to weigh in on matters that concern people in their communities,\u201d Mr Shanmugam said. Religious leaders can also help foster acceptance, peace and common humanity across religions in Singapore. He said: \u201cWe draw the line between religion and politics, but it\u2019s important that religious leaders give guidance to their communities on prayer, on assisting, on how they can help others in distress.\u201d This has been one of the key reasons the situation in Singapore has managed to remain calm, he pointed out. Just a week after the Israel-Hamas war started, Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel and the Mufti of Singapore, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, exchanged letters to affirm the friendship between Jews and Muslims in Singapore. Mr Shanmugam said: \u201cWe have also seen how rhetoric by religious leaders can inflame, rather than reduce tensions.\u201d He added: \u201cPeople in the region say, that if you\u2019re not a Muslim, it is difficult to be of that country\u2019s nationality \u2013 in Malaysia or Indonesia; or if you are not a Buddhist, it is difficult for you to be accepted as a Thai, and so on. \u201cBut in Singapore, people say it doesn\u2019t matter what religion you are, you can be a Singaporean.\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament on Monday that eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at the Jewish and Muslim communities here were lodged in October, about the same as the number of cases reported between January and September. Regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold since the conflict started on Oct 7, he added. In comparison, more than 1,000 anti-Semitic acts have been reported in France since Oct 7, and there has been a 10-fold increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in Australia since the start of the conflict, Mr Shanmugam said. The Government has also seen more anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online, Mr Wong said in Parliament.", "disruptive": true, "location": [1.357107, 103.8194992], "risk": 0.9520173072814941, "timestamp": "08-11-2023", "title": "Religious Leaders' Role in Maintaining Harmony Amid Gaza Conflict", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shanmugam-religious-leaders-role-israel-hamas-gaza-3906066", "city": "Singapore", "segment": "into Singapore"}, {"content": "Russia launched a third nightly round of attacks on Kyiv in six days, with a drone hitting a building in the Dnipropetrovsk region as Moscow steps up attacks on Ukraine.", "disruptive": true, "location": [50.4500336, 30.5241361], "risk": 0.9172728657722473, "timestamp": "03-05-2023", "title": "Ukraine says Dnipro hit by Russian strikes but most drones destroyed", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-dnipro-hit-by-russian-strikes-but-most-drones-destroyed", "city": "Kyiv", "segment": "across the Mediterranean"}, {"content": "Russia hit Ukrainian air bases in overnight strikes, while Ukraine shelled industrial facilities inside Russia.", "disruptive": true, "location": [55.7505412, 37.6174782], "risk": 0.8144199252128601, "timestamp": "29-05-2023", "title": "Russia launches 15th air raid on Kyiv in May; Ukraine destroys over 70 drones, missiles", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-launches-15th-air-raid-on-kyiv-in-may-ukraine-destroys-more-than-40-drones", "city": "Moscow", "segment": "across the Mediterranean"}, {"content": "Russia has tasked mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine, indicating a shortage of combat infantry, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence.

Putin may have signalled in a Feb 6 interview with right-wing US talk show host Tucker Carlson that Russia was interested in negotiations but this would be so much on Moscow\u2019s own terms that Kyiv would not countenance such talks. 'I don\u2019t see any negotiations taking place any time soon,' Mr Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Kremlin-linked Council on Foreign and Defense Policy think tank in Moscow, told AFP. 'There\u2019s nothing they can negotiate about.' While the winter of 2022 was humiliating for Mr Putin, who failed to take Kyiv within days, he has now regrouped and appears reinvigorated by Ukraine\u2019s unsuccessful counteroffensive, the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House in November\u2019s presidential election and the rise of the far-right in Europe. 'Wouldn\u2019t it be better to negotiate with Russia?' Mr Putin told Mr Carlson, urging the United States to discuss a deal that would allow Moscow to control 20 per cent of Ukraine\u2019s territory. 'Sooner or later we\u2019ll come to an agreement anyway.' Mr Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, reiterated Kyiv\u2019s long-held position that no negotiations were possible until Russia withdraws from occupied territories. 'In any other case, negotiations are impossible,' Mr Podoliak told AFP. A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, also ruled out any talks under the current circumstances. 'Negotiations can only take place when Ukraine is in a position of strength on the ground,' said the diplomat. But after two years of resisting the full-scale invasion of the much larger neighbour, Ukraine\u2019s troops are exhausted, and a Republican hold-up on US military aid and Europe\u2019s inability to ramp up weapons supplies fast enough contribute to a sense of uncertainty and gloom in Kyiv. Cracks are beginning to emerge, with Mr Zelensky\u2019s decision to part ways with popular army chief Valery Zaluzhny seen as a sign of the first serious split within the leadership. By contrast, Russia has withstood the initial shock of unprecedented Western sanctions and put its economy on a war footing, ramping up production and recruitment and jailing critics of the invasion. Mr Putin appears to be anxiously awaiting the result of the US election, too. 'I think my expectation is that Putin won\u2019t make peace or a meaningful peace before he sees the result of our election,' a senior US official said on condition of anonymity. Trump has said he would be able to end the war in Ukraine 'in 24 hours' if re-elected, with Mr Zelensky saying such remarks were 'very dangerous'. 'Nobody knows what Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be, starting with himself,' said former French diplomat and political analyst Marie Dumoulin. European leaders increasingly realise that if Mr Putin is allowed to win in Ukraine, he could then be tempted to test Nato\u2019s defences, analysts say. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron called on European countries to back Ukraine 'over the long term' and get ready in case Washington decides to pull the plug on aid. It will take time for the continent\u2019s defence industry to step up ammunition production but the West could still turn things around, said analysts. 'For Europeans in particular, this means putting their money where their mouth is. The acquisition of ammunition, missiles, combat vehicles and spare parts is severely behind schedule,' said Mr Gustav Gressel of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Chinese blue chips were down 0.41%, and U.S. stock futures were down 0.16%. In contrast, Singapore's Straits Times Index was up 0.3%. The bearish global turn was attributed to strong U.S. job openings data, suggesting tapering may start in the fourth quarter despite poor non-farm payroll in August. Earlier, investors had bet the lower-than-expected payroll reading would delay the Federal Reserve's asset purchase trimming. However, several Fed policymakers signaled the U.S. central bank remains on track to reduce asset purchases this year. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 0.2%, the S&P 500 lost 0.13%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.57%.

Moscow said a military plane had crashed in Russian territory while returning to base from a combat mission after suffering a technical malfunction. The downing of a Russian bomber used to fire cruise missiles would be a highly symbolic win for Ukraine, which has been pounded by hundreds of Russian aerial strikes since Moscow invaded more than two years ago. The latest overnight Russian strikes on the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region left more death and destruction, officials said. A horrific Russian air strike on the Dnipropetrovsk region this morning, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Two children are among those killed. A 14-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy. Head of the region Sergiy Lysak said medics had been able to save a six-year-old boy previously reported killed, revising down an earlier toll of nine dead. Twelve people were reported injured. The strikes \u2013 which hit the region\u2019s Synelnykivsky area and the regional capital of Dnipro \u2013 triggered fresh outrage in Kyiv. Children must not be killed in air strikes in modern Europe. We must protect them with a reliable air shield, Mr Kuleba said. Ukraine\u2019s railway operator said train facilities were hit in the attack and that seven employees were among those wounded. A female member of staff was killed, they added. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in response to the strike, repeated calls for Ukraine\u2019s Western allies to supply the country with more air defence systems. Every country that provides air defence systems to Ukraine, every leader who helps persuade our partners that air defence systems should not be stored in warehouses but deployed in real cities and communities facing terror, and everyone who supports our defence is a lifesaver, Mr Zelensky said. The President also announced that he had visited troops and inspected fortifications in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces have taken advantage of Ukraine\u2019s manpower and ammunition shortages and steadily gained ground in the region. In Washington, the US House of Representatives is gearing up for a crucial weekend vote on a long-stalled US$61 billion (S$83 billion) package of military aid that could deliver much-needed weapons to Ukrainian soldiers struggling on the front lines. The downed long-range strategic bomber was a Tu-22M3, the main intelligence directorate of Ukraine\u2019s Defence Ministry said. Russian officials said the plane crashed over the southern Stavropol region. They said the pilots ejected but that at least one member of the crew had died. According to preliminary data, the cause of the accident was a technical malfunction, state news agencies quoted the Defence Ministry as saying. The governor of Stavropol, Mr Vladimir Vladimirov, said two crew members had been taken to a local medical centre. The search for the fourth pilot is continuing, he added, posting photos of the burnt-out and mangled plane fuselage in a field. The plane crashed in the region\u2019s Krasnogvardeysky district, the governor said \u2013 around 400km from the eastern edge of the annexed Crimean peninsula. The Ukraine intelligence directorate said the plane was shot down at a distance of about 300 kilometres from Ukraine. As a result of the hit, the bomber was able to fly to the Stavropol area, where it crashed. Ukraine\u2019s air force said Russia had launched 22 missiles and 14 Iranian-designed attack drones overnight \u2013 including from the downed strategic bomber.

Preparation: Ukraine, with Western help, substantially bolstered its armed forces after 2014, when Russia occupied the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in a lightning operation and pro-Russia separatists overran parts of the east of the country. In 2016, Nato and Kyiv began a training programme for Ukrainian special forces, who now number 2,000 and have been able to help civilian volunteers. 2. Local knowledge: Russia, relying on Soviet-era familiarity with an area that Moscow controlled under the USSR, appears to have underestimated the Ukrainian forces' home-turf advantage. 3. Strategic errors: Military analysts say Russia made strategic errors in the early days of the invasion after it was launched on Feb 24, sending in too few ground troops in the initial phase and failing to get ground and air forces working in tandem. 4.

The countries\u2019 air forces have played second fiddle because of Ukraine\u2019s limited fleet of planes and Russia\u2019s inability to gain the air supremacy it once expected. But as the Russian military presses on with attacks in the east, its air force has taken on a greater role. Military analysts say Russia has increasingly used warplanes near the front lines to drop powerful guided bombs on Ukrainian positions and clear a path forward for the infantry. That tactic, used most notably in Avdiivka, the strategic eastern city captured by Russian forces in February, has yielded good results, experts say. But it has also come with risks. It\u2019s a costly but quite effective tool that Russia is now using in the war, said Mr Serhiy Hrabskyi, a retired Ukrainian army colonel. It is dangerous for them to send their fighter jets close to the front line, he added, but it can impact Ukrainian positions effectively. The Ukrainian army last week said it had shot down seven Su-34 fighter jets, nearly all operating in the east, just a few days after downing an A-50 long-range radar reconnaissance aircraft. It was, according to Ukrainian officials, part of a series of successful strikes against the Russian air force, in which Ukraine claimed to have shot down 15 planes in as many days. The majority of the shootdowns could not be independently verified, and a senior US official expressed scepticism at that number. The official said the Ukrainians appear to be taking credit in some instances for planes they fired at, but which were not confirmed to have been downed. Oryx, a military analysis site that counts losses based on visual evidence, and Russian military bloggers confirmed the loss of two Su-35 fighter jets. Britain\u2019s military intelligence services confirmed the destruction of the A-50 plane. Mr Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defence Project at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the Russian losses probably were the result of some relationship between the Russian aircraft being put in harm\u2019s way, Ukraine\u2019s intelligence gathering on the movements of Russian planes and the deployment of air-defence systems to take them out. After the invasion in February 2022, Ukraine managed to keep Russia from controlling the skies through air combat and the skilful use of anti-aircraft missiles. After only a month and heavy losses among its warplanes, Russia stopped flying its aircraft beyond the front lines, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said in a report, turning instead to launching barrages of cruise and ballistic missiles from afar. But that left Russia unable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fighter bombers to strike Ukrainian front-line positions, the report said. This began to change in early 2023 when Russia started using glide bombs, guided munitions that are dropped from a plane and can fly long distances to the front lines, limiting the risk to planes from anti-aircraft missiles. Carrying hundreds of kilograms of explosives, the glide bombs can smash through the underground bunkers that protect soldiers at the front. These bombs completely destroy any position, Mr Egor Sugar, a Ukrainian soldier who fought in Avdiivka, wrote on social media. All buildings and structures simply turn into a pit after the arrival of just one. Ukrainian officials and military analysts said Russian aviation had played an important role in the capture of Avdiivka, one that required Russian jets to fly closer to the front line to maximise the effect of the glide bombs. And that exposed them to the risk of being shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defences. In late December, the Ukrainian army said it destroyed three Su-34 jets near the Russian-controlled eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the south, where Ukrainian troops have secured small positions. Then came the shootdowns in the east. It remains unclear which air-defence systems Ukraine has deployed. But some army officials and analysts have hinted at the use of the US-made Patriot, America\u2019s most advanced ground-based air-defence system. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think-tank, said Russian forces appeared to tolerate an increased rate of aviation losses in recent weeks in order to conduct glide-bomb strikes in support of ongoing Russian offensive operations in eastern Ukraine. One of Ukraine\u2019s biggest successes in the air battle was the destruction last week of one of Russia\u2019s A-50 radar planes \u2013 the second in 2024 \u2013 which are critical in coordinating aerial bombardments of Ukrainian positions on the front. Taking out their eyes, and taking out their targeting ability, that\u2019s a pretty good win, Mr Karako said. Britain\u2019s military intelligence said Russia had seven other A-50s but that it had highly likely grounded the fleet from flying in support of its military operations to prevent further losses, thus reducing the situational awareness provided to air crews. The Ukrainian air force said Russian aviation activity in eastern Ukraine had significantly subsided by the evening of March 2. It is unclear how long Russia can sustain air losses. Rusi analysts said in February that Russian air crew losses amounted to nearly 160 personnel, which they described as a serious loss of capability. The Russian state news agency Tass said on February 27 that the state-owned defence conglomerate, Rostec, would resume production of the A-50 since it is needed by the Russian armed forces. Mr Hrabskyi likened Russia\u2019s costly strategy in the air to its tactics on the ground, where it has sent wave after wave of troops in bloody assaults to capture cities, regardless of the human cost. The Russians don\u2019t care, he said.

Shanmugam said. This comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza which began on Oct 7, when Hamas fighters launched an attack in Israel, killing around 1,400 people there. Israel retaliated by bombing Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry saying that more than 10,000 have died so far, including more than 4,000 children. Mr Shanmugam said the harmony in Singapore is precious, and everyone will have to play a part to uphold the peace. This despite some comments made recently that religious leaders should not be involved in such issues, he said. Said Mr Shanmugam: \u201cI am at a loss to understand why some think this. This is not how we have the peace and harmony that we have today in Singapore.\u201d He was speaking to about 100 guests and members of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), and religious leaders, at the screening of a locally produced film, Technologies Of The Soul, at One Raffles Quay on Wednesday. It is a documentary about religion and tradition within Singapore\u2019s evolving technological society. Mr Shanmugam pointed out that after the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the then Mufti of Singapore, Mr Syed Isa Semait, condemned the act and emphasised that suicide bombings are against the teachings of Islam. In 2014, Singapore Archbishop William Goh issued guidance on how to pray for victims of the escalating violence in Gaza, as well as how to help with financial aid. That year, Israel invaded Gaza over a period of 50 days. More than 2,200 Palestinians, 66 Israeli soldiers and five Israeli civilians were killed. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite usual, and indeed important, for religious leaders to weigh in on matters that concern people in their communities,\u201d Mr Shanmugam said. Religious leaders can also help foster acceptance, peace and common humanity across religions in Singapore. He said: \u201cWe draw the line between religion and politics, but it\u2019s important that religious leaders give guidance to their communities on prayer, on assisting, on how they can help others in distress.\u201d This has been one of the key reasons the situation in Singapore has managed to remain calm, he pointed out. Just a week after the Israel-Hamas war started, Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel and the Mufti of Singapore, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, exchanged letters to affirm the friendship between Jews and Muslims in Singapore. Mr Shanmugam said: \u201cWe have also seen how rhetoric by religious leaders can inflame, rather than reduce tensions.\u201d He added: \u201cPeople in the region say, that if you\u2019re not a Muslim, it is difficult to be of that country\u2019s nationality \u2013 in Malaysia or Indonesia; or if you are not a Buddhist, it is difficult for you to be accepted as a Thai, and so on. \u201cBut in Singapore, people say it doesn\u2019t matter what religion you are, you can be a Singaporean.\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament on Monday that eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at the Jewish and Muslim communities here were lodged in October, about the same as the number of cases reported between January and September. Regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold since the conflict started on Oct 7, he added. In comparison, more than 1,000 anti-Semitic acts have been reported in France since Oct 7, and there has been a 10-fold increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in Australia since the start of the conflict, Mr Shanmugam said. The Government has also seen more anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online, Mr Wong said in Parliament.", "disruptive": true, "location": [1.357107, 103.8194992], "risk": 0.9520173072814941, "timestamp": "08-11-2023", "title": "Religious Leaders' Role in Maintaining Harmony Amid Gaza Conflict", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shanmugam-religious-leaders-role-israel-hamas-gaza-3906066", "city": "Singapore", "segment": "into Singapore"}, {"content": "Russia launched a third nightly round of attacks on Kyiv in six days, with a drone hitting a building in the Dnipropetrovsk region.", "disruptive": true, "location": [50.4500336, 30.5241361], "risk": 0.917832612991333, "timestamp": "03-05-2023", "title": "Ukraine says Dnipro hit by Russian strikes but most drones destroyed", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-dnipro-hit-by-russian-strikes-but-most-drones-destroyed", "city": "Kyiv", "segment": "across the Mediterranean"}, {"content": "Russia launched its 15th air raid on Kyiv in May, targeting Ukrainian air bases in overnight strikes.

The downing of a Russian bomber used to fire cruise missiles would be a highly symbolic win for Ukraine, which has been pounded by hundreds of Russian aerial strikes since Moscow invaded more than two years ago. The latest overnight Russian strikes on the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region left more death and destruction, officials said. A horrific Russian air strike on the Dnipropetrovsk region this morning, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Two children are among those killed. A 14-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy. Head of the region Sergiy Lysak said medics had been able to save a six-year-old boy previously reported killed, revising down an earlier toll of nine dead. Twelve people were reported injured.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, in response to the strike, repeated calls for Ukraine\u2019s Western allies to supply the country with more air defence systems. Every country that provides air defence systems to Ukraine, every leader who helps persuade our partners that air defence systems should not be stored in warehouses but deployed in real cities and communities facing terror, and everyone who supports our defence is a lifesaver, Mr Zelensky said. The President also announced that he had visited troops and inspected fortifications in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces have taken advantage of Ukraine\u2019s manpower and ammunition shortages and steadily gained ground in the region. In Washington, the US House of Representatives is gearing up for a crucial weekend vote on a long-stalled US$61 billion (S$83 billion) package of military aid that could deliver much-needed weapons to Ukrainian soldiers struggling on the front lines.

Russian officials said the plane crashed over the southern Stavropol region. They said the pilots ejected but that at least one member of the crew had died. According to preliminary data, the cause of the accident was a technical malfunction, state news agencies quoted the Defence Ministry as saying. The governor of Stavropol, Mr Vladimir Vladimirov, said two crew members had been taken to a local medical centre.

The plane crashed in the region\u2019s Krasnogvardeysky district, the governor said \u2013 around 400km from the eastern edge of the annexed Crimean peninsula. The Ukraine intelligence directorate said the plane was shot down at a distance of about 300 kilometres from Ukraine. As a result of the hit, the bomber was able to fly to the Stavropol area, where it crashed.

The differing views between China and the US are seen as leading to a path of collision. Adm Dong also criticized the Philippines for allowing US missile deployment, in response to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's assertion of territorial claims in the South China Sea. The US has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, adding to the tensions.

Shanmugam said. This comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza which began on Oct 7, when Hamas fighters launched an attack in Israel, killing around 1,400 people there. Israel retaliated by bombing Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry saying that more than 10,000 have died so far, including more than 4,000 children. Mr Shanmugam said the harmony in Singapore is precious, and everyone will have to play a part to uphold the peace. This despite some comments made recently that religious leaders should not be involved in such issues, he said. Said Mr Shanmugam: \u201cI am at a loss to understand why some think this. This is not how we have the peace and harmony that we have today in Singapore.\u201d He was speaking to about 100 guests and members of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), and religious leaders, at the screening of a locally produced film, Technologies Of The Soul, at One Raffles Quay on Wednesday. It is a documentary about religion and tradition within Singapore\u2019s evolving technological society. Mr Shanmugam pointed out that after the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the then Mufti of Singapore, Mr Syed Isa Semait, condemned the act and emphasised that suicide bombings are against the teachings of Islam. In 2014, Singapore Archbishop William Goh issued guidance on how to pray for victims of the escalating violence in Gaza, as well as how to help with financial aid. That year, Israel invaded Gaza over a period of 50 days. More than 2,200 Palestinians, 66 Israeli soldiers and five Israeli civilians were killed. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite usual, and indeed important, for religious leaders to weigh in on matters that concern people in their communities,\u201d Mr Shanmugam said. Religious leaders can also help foster acceptance, peace and common humanity across religions in Singapore. He said: \u201cWe draw the line between religion and politics, but it\u2019s important that religious leaders give guidance to their communities on prayer, on assisting, on how they can help others in distress.\u201d This has been one of the key reasons the situation in Singapore has managed to remain calm, he pointed out. Just a week after the Israel-Hamas war started, Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel and the Mufti of Singapore, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, exchanged letters to affirm the friendship between Jews and Muslims in Singapore. Mr Shanmugam said: \u201cWe have also seen how rhetoric by religious leaders can inflame, rather than reduce tensions.\u201d He added: \u201cPeople in the region say, that if you\u2019re not a Muslim, it is difficult to be of that country\u2019s nationality \u2013 in Malaysia or Indonesia; or if you are not a Buddhist, it is difficult for you to be accepted as a Thai, and so on. \u201cBut in Singapore, people say it doesn\u2019t matter what religion you are, you can be a Singaporean.\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament on Monday that eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at the Jewish and Muslim communities here were lodged in October, about the same as the number of cases reported between January and September. Regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold since the conflict started on Oct 7, he added. In comparison, more than 1,000 anti-Semitic acts have been reported in France since Oct 7, and there has been a 10-fold increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in Australia since the start of the conflict, Mr Shanmugam said. The Government has also seen more anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online, Mr Wong said in Parliament.", "disruptive": true, "location": [1.357107, 103.8194992], "risk": 0.9520173072814941, "timestamp": "08-11-2023", "title": "Religious Leaders' Role in Maintaining Harmony Amid Gaza Conflict", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shanmugam-religious-leaders-role-israel-hamas-gaza-3906066", "city": "Singapore", "segment": "into Singapore"}, {"content": "Russia launched a third nightly round of attacks on Kyiv in six days, with a drone hitting a building in the Dnipropetrovsk region.", "disruptive": true, "location": [50.4500336, 30.5241361], "risk": 0.917832612991333, "timestamp": "03-05-2023", "title": "Ukraine says Dnipro hit by Russian strikes but most drones destroyed", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-dnipro-hit-by-russian-strikes-but-most-drones-destroyed", "city": "Kyiv", "segment": "across the Mediterranean"}, {"content": "Russia hit Ukrainian air bases in overnight strikes, while Ukraine shelled industrial facilities inside Russia.", "disruptive": true, "location": [55.7505412, 37.6174782], "risk": 0.8144199252128601, "timestamp": "29-05-2023", "title": "Russia launches 15th air raid on Kyiv in May; Ukraine destroys over 70 drones, missiles", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-launches-15th-air-raid-on-kyiv-in-may-ukraine-destroys-more-than-40-drones", "city": "Moscow", "segment": "across the Mediterranean"}, {"content": "Russia has tasked mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine, indicating a shortage of combat infantry, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence.

This was a key theme of discussion among academics from the two countries, as well as India and Indonesia, at a biennial forum \u2013 the eighth International Maritime Security Conference \u2013 in Singapore on Thursday. Dr Marty Natalegawa, Indonesia\u2019s former foreign minister, said that from South-east Asia\u2019s perspective, there is an 'arc of instability' all around the region \u2013 from a potential rivalry between China and India for access in the Indian Ocean, to nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, and competition between the US, China, Australia and New Zealand for influence among Pacific island countries. While much of the situation can be attributed to longstanding issues, 'what is perhaps new is the extremely deep sense of distrust that is now fuelling and driving divisions among countries', he said. Retired admiral Karambir Singh, who is chairman of the Delhi-based National Maritime Foundation think-tank, said the international environment today is reminiscent of the Cold War years, and perhaps even more worrisome. Issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and other flashpoints in the Indo-Pacific have been exacerbated by geopolitical confrontation, he said. 'The free and open seas that have underwritten our common prosperity are now in danger of being converted into contested and closed seas, which is the very antithesis of prosperity.' Veteran diplomat Tommy Koh, who moderated the session held at the Changi Exhibition Centre, drew attention to the disputed island chains known as the Senkaku to the Japanese or Diaoyu to the Chinese in the East China Sea, as well as the South China Sea waterway that is contested by China and several South-east Asian countries. The US and other navies have challenged China\u2019s claims to sovereignty in the South China Sea by sailing in freedom of navigation operations, to which China has responded by sending its own warships and planes to the same area. There have been several incidents of near collision between Chinese vessels and those of other countries, and the situation there is 'combustible', added Professor Koh. Speakers at the forum also discussed issues such as whether China has shown restraint over Taiwan as well as India\u2019s role as a 'net security provider' for the Indian Ocean region \u2013 how it contributes to security there through activities such as military exercises and exchanges. The one-day forum, established in 2009, was co-organised by the Republic of Singapore Navy and the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). Prof Koh asked Mr Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), and American academic David Finkelstein to share their thoughts on the lack of communication between Beijing and Washington. Bilateral relations have soured in recent years, and the superpowers have been trading barbs over issues such as technology, Taiwan and trade. Dr Finkelstein, director of the China and Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Division at the Centre for Naval Analyses in Virginia, said he agrees that both countries and the region would be better off when China and the US talk to each other. 'I know that people in the Pentagon would be very anxious to have serious dialogues with friends in the PLA. And one of the priorities, as I understand, is risk management, in order to deal with all of the very difficult issues,' he said, adding that these include Chinese activities near Taiwan and freedom of navigation operations. Mr Zhou, who is a senior fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Centre for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, responded that although he is not optimistic about the US-China relationship, he is still hopeful that disagreements can be managed. 'Even if they don\u2019t trust each other at all, I don\u2019t believe this is the end of the world. Why? Because the Cold War example tells us that even enemies could actually talk to each other out of mutual fear. And China and the US are not enemies yet,' he said. 'So we should have confidence in this relationship being manageable... We have to try very hard because peace has to be earned. It is still possible, because none of us wants to have a war.'", "disruptive": true, "location": [1.357107, 103.8194992], "risk": 0.9553780555725098, "timestamp": "04-05-2023", "title": "US-China disputes could worsen tensions in Asian waters", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/us-china-disputes-could-worsen-tensions-in-asian-waters-say-speakers-at-s-pore-forum", "city": "Singapore", "segment": "into Singapore"}, {"content": "Australia has been a crucial supplier of iron ore to China, aiding its economic expansion.", "disruptive": true, "location": [-35.2975906, 149.1012676], "risk": 0.9418277144432068, "timestamp": "25-09-2024", "title": "Australia seeks new critical minerals partners amid China tensions", "url": "https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/critical-minerals-security-partnership-may-not-be-enough-for-australia/", "city": "Canberra", "segment": "entering the Indian Ocean"}, {"content": "Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Japan to attend the Group of Seven (G-7) summit, aiming to garner support from the world\u2019s rich democracies and engage with 'Global South' leaders with ties to Russia.

This decision makes Turkey the first of Israel's key partners to stop trade over the ongoing conflict. The move was prompted by Israel's 'uncompromising attitude' and the deteriorating situation in Gaza's southern Rafah region, where Israel has threatened a new offensive. Turkey's Trade Minister Omer Bolat stated that all exports and imports with Israel are halted until a ceasefire is achieved and humanitarian aid is allowed without interruption. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz criticized the decision, claiming it breaks international trade agreements. Meanwhile, Hamas praised Turkey's decision as supportive of Palestinian rights. Turkey is exploring alternative arrangements to ensure Palestinians are not adversely affected by this trade halt. In April, Turkey had already curbed exports of several products due to Israel's refusal to allow Turkish participation in aid operations for Gaza. The halt affects US$5.4 billion in Turkish exports and US$1.6 billion in Israeli imports. Turkish exporters are seeking ways to send goods to Israel via third countries. Israel is also looking for alternative trade routes. Turkey has condemned Israel's military actions in Gaza and plans to join South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The decision to halt trade comes after domestic backlash against Turkey's previous maintenance of commercial ties with Israel, which affected the ruling AK Party's performance in local elections.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after intense rocket fire from Lebanon that Israel has dealt 'a series of blows on Hezbollah that it could have never imagined'. A defiant Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said the group was in a 'new phase' in its battle against Israel. Both spoke after attacks on northern Israel sent hundreds of thousands of people to bomb shelters and caused damage in the Haifa area. 'No country can tolerate attacks on its citizens,' Mr Netanyahu said nearly a year into the Gaza war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct 7 attack on Israel that has also drawn in Iran-backed groups across the region, including Hezbollah. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said military actions 'will continue until we reach a point where we may ensure the safe return of Israel\u2019s northern communities to their homes'. 'This is our goal, this is our mission, and we will employ the means necessary to achieve it.' Army chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi in a video statement vowed to 'hit anyone who threatens' Israelis. Israel\u2019s key ally, the United States, said military escalation is not in Israel\u2019s 'best interest', with President Joe Biden saying Washington was doing everything possible to prevent a wider conflagration. Mr Biden said his administration was 'going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out'. 'And we\u2019re still pushing hard,' he added. Ahead of the annual General Assembly, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned of the risk of Lebanon becoming 'another Gaza' and said it was 'clear that both sides are not interested in a ceasefire' in the Gaza war. The 27-nation European Union bloc is 'extremely concerned' about the escalating violence and is calling for an 'urgent' ceasefire, its foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. A full-blown war 'must be averted, including by renewed intense diplomatic mediation efforts', he added. Israel has signalled a shift in focus to Iran-backed Hezbollah after nearly a year of cross-border fire that began in October in what Hezbollah calls support for Hamas Palestinian militants fighting Israel. An Israeli air strike in a densely populated Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut on Sept 20 killed the head of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan Force, Ibrahim Aqil. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said the strike killed 45 people. It came after a series of coordinated communications device blasts earlier in the week that killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000, and which were blamed on Israel. Speaking at Aqil\u2019s funeral in Beirut on Sept 22, Mr Qassem said: 'We have entered a new phase, namely an open reckoning' with Israel. 'Threats will not stop us... We are ready to face all military possibilities.' Hezbollah\u2019s Radwan Force has spearheaded its ground operations, and Israel has repeatedly called for its fighters to be pushed back from the border. UN special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert posted on X that the region was 'on the brink of an imminent catastrophe'. The Israeli army said more than 150 rockets, missiles and drones were fired at its territory during the night and early on Sept 22, most from Lebanon. It said it attacked Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon in response and 'to prevent a larger-scale attack'. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said three people were killed in Israeli strikes on southern areas, and Hezbollah announced two fighters were killed. Israel\u2019s civil defence agency ordered all schools in the north closed after the rocket fire. 'It reminds me of Oct 7 when everybody stayed home,' Haifa resident Patrice Wolff told AFP. Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli military production facilities and an air base in the Haifa area after this week\u2019s communication device blasts. 'In an initial response,' Hezbollah said it 'bombed the Rafael military industry complexes' in northern Israel with 'dozens' of rockets. It said it targeted Ramat David airbase deep inside Israel with Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets in Hezbollah\u2019s apparent first use of that rocket type since the Gaza war began. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has acknowledged that the communication devices attack was 'unprecedented'. He vowed that Israel \u2013 which has not commented \u2013 would face retribution. Months of near-daily exchanges have killed hundreds in Lebanon, mostly fighters, and dozens in Israel and the annexed Golan, forcing tens of thousands on both sides from their homes. Netanyahu on Sept 17 announced an expansion of Israel\u2019s war goals to include the return home of northern residents. International mediators from Qatar, Egypt and the United States have for months tried to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, which diplomats repeatedly said would help calm regional tensions. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told AFP in an interview on Sept 22 that the Israel-Hezbollah flare-up 'negatively affects' Gaza ceasefire efforts. 'The problem is the lack of political will on the Israeli side,' he added. Mr Netanyahu\u2019s critics in Israel have accused him of dragging out the war. Hamas\u2019 Oct 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity. Of the 251 hostages also seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead. Israel\u2019s retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,431 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory\u2019s health ministry.

Moscow said a military plane had crashed in Russian territory while returning to base from a combat mission after suffering a technical malfunction. The downing of a Russian bomber used to fire cruise missiles would be a highly symbolic win for Ukraine, which has been pounded by hundreds of Russian aerial strikes since Moscow invaded more than two years ago. The latest overnight Russian strikes on the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region left more death and destruction, officials said. A horrific Russian air strike on the Dnipropetrovsk region this morning, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Two children are among those killed. A 14-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy. Head of the region Sergiy Lysak said medics had been able to save a six-year-old boy previously reported killed, revising down an earlier toll of nine dead. Twelve people were reported injured.

Children must not be killed in air strikes in modern Europe. We must protect them with a reliable air shield, Mr Kuleba said. Ukraine\u2019s railway operator said train facilities were hit in the attack and that seven employees were among those wounded. A female member of staff was killed, they added. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in response to the strike, repeated calls for Ukraine\u2019s Western allies to supply the country with more air defence systems. Every country that provides air defence systems to Ukraine, every leader who helps persuade our partners that air defence systems should not be stored in warehouses but deployed in real cities and communities facing terror, and everyone who supports our defence is a lifesaver, Mr Zelensky said. The President also announced that he had visited troops and inspected fortifications in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces have taken advantage of Ukraine\u2019s manpower and ammunition shortages and steadily gained ground in the region. In Washington, the US House of Representatives is gearing up for a crucial weekend vote on a long-stalled US$61 billion (S$83 billion) package of military aid that could deliver much-needed weapons to Ukrainian soldiers struggling on the front lines. The downed long-range strategic bomber was a Tu-22M3, the main intelligence directorate of Ukraine\u2019s Defence Ministry said. Russian officials said the plane crashed over the southern Stavropol region. They said the pilots ejected but that at least one member of the crew had died. According to preliminary data, the cause of the accident was a technical malfunction, state news agencies quoted the Defence Ministry as saying. The governor of Stavropol, Mr Vladimir Vladimirov, said two crew members had been taken to a local medical centre. The search for the fourth pilot is continuing, he added, posting photos of the burnt-out and mangled plane fuselage in a field. The plane crashed in the region\u2019s Krasnogvardeysky district, the governor said \u2013 around 400km from the eastern edge of the annexed Crimean peninsula. The Ukraine intelligence directorate said the plane was shot down at a distance of about 300 kilometres from Ukraine. As a result of the hit, the bomber was able to fly to the Stavropol area, where it crashed. Ukraine\u2019s air force said Russia had launched 22 missiles and 14 Iranian-designed attack drones overnight \u2013 including from the downed strategic bomber.

In 2016, Nato and Kyiv began a training programme for Ukrainian special forces, who now number 2,000 and have been able to help civilian volunteers. 2. Local knowledge: Russia, relying on Soviet-era familiarity with an area that Moscow controlled under the USSR, appears to have underestimated the Ukrainian forces' home-turf advantage. 3. Strategic errors: Military analysts say Russia made strategic errors in the early days of the invasion after it was launched on Feb 24, sending in too few ground troops in the initial phase and failing to get ground and air forces working in tandem. 4.

The countries\u2019 air forces have played second fiddle because of Ukraine\u2019s limited fleet of planes and Russia\u2019s inability to gain the air supremacy it once expected. But as the Russian military presses on with attacks in the east, its air force has taken on a greater role. Military analysts say Russia has increasingly used warplanes near the front lines to drop powerful guided bombs on Ukrainian positions and clear a path forward for the infantry. That tactic, used most notably in Avdiivka, the strategic eastern city captured by Russian forces in February, has yielded good results, experts say. But it has also come with risks. The Ukrainian army last week said it had shot down seven Su-34 fighter jets, nearly all operating in the east, just a few days after downing an A-50 long-range radar reconnaissance aircraft. It was, according to Ukrainian officials, part of a series of successful strikes against the Russian air force, in which Ukraine claimed to have shot down 15 planes in as many days. The majority of the shootdowns could not be independently verified, and a senior US official expressed scepticism at that number. Oryx, a military analysis site that counts losses based on visual evidence, and Russian military bloggers confirmed the loss of two Su-35 fighter jets. Britain\u2019s military intelligence services confirmed the destruction of the A-50 plane. Mr Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defence Project at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the Russian losses probably were the result of \u201csome relationship between the Russian aircraft being put in harm\u2019s way\u201d, Ukraine\u2019s intelligence gathering on the movements of Russian planes and the deployment of air-defence systems \u201cto take them out\u201d. After the invasion in February 2022, Ukraine managed to keep Russia from controlling the skies through air combat and the skilful use of anti-aircraft missiles. After only a month and heavy losses among its warplanes, Russia stopped flying its aircraft beyond the front lines, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said in a report, turning instead to launching barrages of cruise and ballistic missiles from afar. But that left Russia \u201cunable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower\u201d of its fighter bombers to strike Ukrainian front-line positions, the report said. This began to change in early 2023 when Russia started using glide bombs, guided munitions that are dropped from a plane and can fly long distances to the front lines, limiting the risk to planes from anti-aircraft missiles. Carrying hundreds of kilograms of explosives, the glide bombs can smash through the underground bunkers that protect soldiers at the front. Ukrainian officials and military analysts said Russian aviation had played an important role in the capture of Avdiivka, one that required Russian jets \u201cto fly closer\u201d to the front line to maximise the effect of the glide bombs. And that exposed them to the risk of being shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defences. In late December, the Ukrainian army said it destroyed three Su-34 jets near the Russian-controlled eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the south, where Ukrainian troops have secured small positions. Then came the shootdowns in the east. It remains unclear which air-defence systems Ukraine has deployed. But some army officials and analysts have hinted at the use of the US-made Patriot, America\u2019s most advanced ground-based air-defence system. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think-tank, said \u201cRussian forces appeared to tolerate an increased rate of aviation losses in recent weeks in order to conduct glide-bomb strikes in support of ongoing Russian offensive operations in eastern Ukraine\u201d. One of Ukraine\u2019s biggest successes in the air battle was the destruction last week of one of Russia\u2019s A-50 radar planes \u2013 the second in 2024 \u2013 which are critical in coordinating aerial bombardments of Ukrainian positions on the front. Britain\u2019s military intelligence said Russia had seven other A-50s but that it had \u201chighly likely grounded the fleet from flying\u201d in support of its military operations to prevent further losses, thus reducing the \u201csituational awareness provided to air crews\u201d. The Ukrainian air force said Russian aviation activity in eastern Ukraine had significantly subsided by the evening of March 2. It is unclear how long Russia can sustain air losses. Rusi analysts said in February that Russian air crew losses amounted to nearly 160 personnel, which they described as \u201ca serious loss of capability\u201d. The Russian state news agency Tass said on February 27 that the state-owned defence conglomerate, Rostec, would resume production of the A-50 \u201csince it is needed by the Russian armed forces\u201d. Mr Hrabskyi likened Russia\u2019s costly strategy in the air to its tactics on the ground, where it has sent wave after wave of troops in bloody assaults to capture cities, regardless of the human cost. \u201cThe Russians don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have an order, they will use all available capabilities, all available weapons systems to attack.\u201d", "disruptive": true, "location": [48.1338824, 37.7466719], "risk": 0.841900646686554, "timestamp": "05-03-2024", "title": "Shift in Russian tactics intensifies air war in Ukraine", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/world/europe/ukraine-war-russia-planes.html", "city": "Avdiivka", "segment": "across the Mediterranean"}, {"content": "Boeing provided US regulators with the names of employees on its 737 Max door team after criticism from lawmakers and a federal safety official.", "disruptive": true, "location": [41.8755616, -87.6244212], "risk": 0.8651884198188782, "timestamp": "06-03-2024", "title": "Boeing discloses 737 Max employee names amid NTSB investigation", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ntsb-says-boeing-has-not-provided-some-information-sought-737-max-9-probe-2024-03-06/", "city": "Chicago", "segment": "across the Atlantic"}, {"content": "China dispatched a senior diplomat, Mr. Liu Jianchao, to Italy to persuade the nation to remain in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).", "disruptive": true, "location": [41.8933203, 12.4829321], "risk": 0.9540377855300903, "timestamp": "14-12-2023", "title": "China's Diplomatic Efforts to Keep Italy in Belt and Road Initiative", "url": "https://www.csis.org/analysis/italy-withdraws-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative", "city": "Rome", "segment": "across the Mediterranean"}, {"content": "Vietnamese coffee growers have been hit hard in 2024 by the worst drought in nearly a decade, raising concerns of pricier espressos across the world.", "disruptive": true, "location": [21.0283334, 105.854041], "risk": 0.9477713108062744, "timestamp": "24-06-2024", "title": "Vietnam coffee farms face drought but some thrive", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/some-vietnam-coffee-farms-thrive-despite-drought-may-not-stop-espresso-price-2024-06-24/", "city": "Hanoi", "segment": "entering the Indian Ocean"}, {"content": "The Australian police are investigating a former British military pilot suspected of involvement in the training of Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army pilots at a flying school in South Africa.", "disruptive": true, "location": [-28.8166236, 24.991639], "risk": 0.9140165448188782, "timestamp": "17-03-2023", "title": "Australian police investigate South African flying school executive over Chinese military training", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/australian-police-investigate-south-african-flying-school-exec-over-chinese-2023-03-17/", "city": "South Africa", "segment": "entering the Indian Ocean"}, {"content": "In Izyum, Ukraine, residents are grappling with the aftermath of six months of Russian occupation.

Now comes the hard part: dealing with economic crises. Inflation is at 143%, net reserves of foreign currency are deep in the red, savers are ditching the peso, and a recession is looming. Four in 10 Argentines live in poverty and a sharp peso devaluation is likely. Milei, who is pledging economic shock therapy such as shutting the central bank and dollarization, won a second-round runoff vote on Sunday with some 56% to rival Sergio Massa's 44%. Milei now faces the huge challenge of turning around the economy once he takes office on Dec. 10. Failure could lead to the already embattled country suffering a tenth sovereign debt default, poverty climbing and possible social unrest. Argentina's high inflation rate creates huge distortions in markets and for consumers, with prices changing weekly. A central bank poll of analysts forecast 185% inflation by the end of the year. In a bid to tamp down inflation Argentina's central bank has hiked the benchmark interest rate to 133%, which encourages saving in pesos, but hurts access to credit and economic growth. Argentina's peso currency has been shackled by capital controls since a market crash in 2019, which has led to an unwieldy array of exchange rates. Milei has pledged to quickly undo capital controls and eventually dollarize the economy, while a sharp devaluation is likely in the near future to bring the official and parallel rates closer together. Argentina's central bank reserves of foreign currency are near their lowest level since 2006, and in net terms are widely seen by analysts to be in negative territory after a major drought hit exports of key cash crops like soy, corn, and wheat. The low reserves threaten the country's ability to repay debts to major creditor the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and private bondholders, as well as cover key imports. Argentina will need to revamp its creaking $44 billion IMF program. The government has agreed on an extended currency swap with China to help cover some of its costs, and had to delay some payments to key trade partners such as Brazil. Latin America's third-largest economy is on track to shrink 2% this year, partly due to the impact of the recent drought that cut corn and soy crops in half. Along with triple-digit inflation, that is likely to sharpen poverty levels, with two-fifths of people already living under the poverty line as salaries and savings are eroded. Argentina, rich in grains, shale gas and lithium, could see a boost next year as better rains help the harvest, a new gas pipeline trims reliance on costly imports, and demand rises for the lithium needed for electric vehicle batteries. Soy and corn are expected to have far stronger harvests, which will bring in much-needed foreign currency.", "disruptive": true, "location": [-34.6083696, -58.4440583], "risk": 0.9338451623916626, "timestamp": "10-07-2024", "title": "Argentina's President-elect Milei faces economic challenges", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/milei-s-plan-for-argentina-economic-overhaul-faces-4-big-hurdles", "city": "Buenos Aires", "segment": "across the Atlantic"}, {"content": "Ukraine attacked eight Russian regions with dozens of long-range strike drones, setting ablaze a fuel depot and hitting three power substations.", "disruptive": true, "location": [50.4500336, 30.5241361], "risk": 0.9660788178443909, "timestamp": "20-04-2024", "title": "Ukrainian drones strike Russian fuel depot, substations in major attack", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-drone-attack-sets-ablaze-russian-fuel-depot-hits-susbtations-kyiv-source-2024-04-20/", "city": "Kyiv", "segment": "across the Atlantic"}, {"content": "A deal between Singapore and Malaysia to develop South-east Asia\u2019s first cross-border economic zone in Johor will be shaped by private-sector needs from both sides of the Causeway, trade officials and businesses said at a July 11 forum.
