Russia has vast Soviet-era stocks of the relatively cheap bombs.\nOver the past several months, Russia has been able to grind out battlefield gains by hammering front-line towns and infantry positions with aerial bombs.\n\"Today, four guided aerial bombs came in, about 500 metres away. I was on the ground, and it started vibrating, I was thrown upwards - and I'm not small,\" Winnie said.\nShortage of weapons\nThe Russian assault, which is driving towards the towns of Lyptsi and Vovchansk, north of Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, began on May 10.\nThe Russians appear to have been able to advance by at least several kilometres in some places, one of the fastest advances either side has seen since 2022, the first year of Russia's full-scale invasion.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/anti-putin-russian-paramilitaries-join-ukraines-fight-in-kharkiv-region"}
