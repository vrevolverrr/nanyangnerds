In December 2023, it launched an updated National AI Strategy 2.0, outlining ways to leverage AI to empower workers and businesses.\nIn his Budget speech, DPM Wong said AI is not just about ChatGPT or large language models.\nInstead, it is a general purpose technology that has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, and to enhance productivity.\nMs Priya Mahajan, head of public policy and regulatory at Verizon, said Singapore’s digital ecosystem holds the potential to fuel an ongoing cycle of economic growth.\nThis must be accompanied by robust privacy measures and free data flows, as well as a light-touch regulatory approach.\n“With respect to emerging technologies, implementing global best practices, such as the establishment of a single unified regulatory body, will ensure consistent standards for both consumers and businesses across different industries.\n“This will in turn foster a climate of technology-related investment, innovation and competition in Singapore,” she said.\nMs Tay Bee Kheng, president of Cisco Asean, hopes to see more resources channelled into AI governance.\n“With only 36 per cent of respondents in Singapore saying their organisations have highly comprehensive AI policies and protocols in place, according to Cisco’s AI Readiness Index, more support will be required to educate organisations on the importance of adapting internal policies to address data privacy and security and the ethical use of AI,” she said.\nMs Tay welcomed Singapore’s efforts to strengthen its cyber-security resilience, with the setting up of a new National Cybersecurity Command Centre that will better coordinate its cyber-defence operations.\nAccording to a study from Capital Economics, which ranks countries according to their potential to benefit from AI, Singapore came in second after the United States in 2023, followed by Britain and Switzerland.\nDespite its strong innovation capacity and huge investments in AI, China came in around the middle of the group of 33 countries due to its strict regulatory approach that slowed the spread of AI technology, the report said.\nMr Sujith Abraham, senior vice-president and general manager of Asean at Salesforce, a US cloud-based software company, was hopeful that the planned investment will “democratise access to digital technologies, spur AI innovation and accelerate business transformation”.\n“AI is no longer a nice-to-have but an imperative for all businesses to implement and enable their workforce to work with if they don’t want to get left behind,” he said.\nMs Jess O’Reilly, area vice-president for Asia at US software company UiPath, said initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster private-public partnerships and combine education and innovation can help workers embrace digital transformation.\nShe added that the extension of the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the new SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme demonstrate the Singapore Government’s continuing support for digital upskilling and access to learning opportunities.\nCorrection note: In an earlier version of the story, we said Google’s AI Trailblazers supported 100 organisations in developing impactful generative AI solutions in Singapore.
