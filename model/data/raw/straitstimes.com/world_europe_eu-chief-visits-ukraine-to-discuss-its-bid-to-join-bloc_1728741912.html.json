The entire Europe is a target for Russia. Ukraine is only the first stage in this aggression,” he said.\nDespite reservations among some member states, EU leaders are expected to approve Ukraine’s candidate status at a summit on June 23-24, though with strict conditions attached.\nCrisis and famine\nThe European Union and the United States have strongly backed Ukraine, sending weapons and cash to help it see off Russian forces, and punishing Moscow with unprecedented economic sanctions.\nZelensky has urged them on during a diplomatic offensive that has seen him regularly appear via video link at various parliaments and summits around the world.\nAddressing the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit in Singapore on Saturday, he highlighted the dangers of a global food crisis posed by Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports.\nHe warned of “an acute and severe food crisis and famine”, adding that the “shortage of foodstuffs will inexorably lead to political chaos” – all of it “the direct consequence of the acts of the Russian state”.\nFor residents in Mykolaiv, every day brings a brush with death.\nIgor Karputov, 31, recalled how his neighbourhood was hit last week, shaking his apartment, and he helped a bleeding man to an ambulance.\n“Then I went to another place which had been hit, where emergency services were already taking care of someone,” he told AFP.\n“But they were dead. And the one I had helped died in an ambulance.”\nRussian passports issued\nIn areas now controlled by its forces, Moscow has sought to impose its authority.\nAuthorities in the occupied southern city of Kherson handed out Russian passports to local residents for the first time on Saturday, news agencies reported.\nRussia’s Tass agency said 23 Kherson residents received a Russian passport at a ceremony through a “simplified procedure” allowed by a decree from President Vladimir Putin.\nUkraine has called the passports “legally void”.\nLast month, Russian authorities introduced the ruble in the Kherson region as an official currency alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/eu-chief-visits-ukraine-to-discuss-its-bid-to-join-bloc"}
