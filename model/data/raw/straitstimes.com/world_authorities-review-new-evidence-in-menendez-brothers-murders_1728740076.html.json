Mr Jose Menendez was shot in the back of the head and Ms Kitty Menendez was shot 15 times. At the time of the murder, Lyle was 21 and Erik was 18.\nAt a televised trial that captivated the US in 1996, the brothers claimed they had been sexually abused by both parents for years and were acting in self-defence. Prosecutors argued that the pair were seeking their parents’ multi-million-dollar fortune.\nLos Angeles District Attorney George Gascon on Oct 3 said his office would review what he called new evidence that the brothers were molested, including a letter that Erik Menendez allegedly wrote eight months before the murders, describing abuse.\nInvestigators are also examining allegations from a member of the 1980s pop band Menudo that he was abused by Mr Jose Menendez, who was a music executive. Those allegations were publicised in 2023 in a Peacock documentary series called Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.\nA recent Netflix series, Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story, has revived interest in the case.\nThe new review could lead to various outcomes, Mr Gascon said. The brothers could be immediately freed or given a new sentence or fresh trial. Mr Gascon said he had an open mind about the case.\n“We’re not ready to believe or do not believe that information,” Mr Gascon said at a press conference.\n“But we’re here to tell you that we have a moral and ethical obligation to review what is being presented to us and make a determination.”\nThe Menendez brothers in 2023 petitioned to have their sentence vacated.\nOn Oct 3, their attorney, Mr Mark Geragos praised Mr Gascon for what he called “a bold step”.\nMr Geragos told reporters: “It may not be a popular decision in prosecutorial circles, but I would think that in our culture we’ve come a long way in the last 10 years, maybe 15 years.\n“I think we’re at a point now where any reasonable person taking a look at this case believes they should be out.” REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/authorities-review-new-evidence-in-menendez-brothers-murders"}
