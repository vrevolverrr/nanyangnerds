Caixin also noted that firms expressed concerns over how long Covid restrictions would remain in place.\nOn Thursday, tech giant Apple warned that China’s Covid lockdowns were among the factors that would dent its June quarter results by US$4-8 billion.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/chinas-factory-activity-contracts-at-steepest-rate-in-26-months-caixin-pmi"}
