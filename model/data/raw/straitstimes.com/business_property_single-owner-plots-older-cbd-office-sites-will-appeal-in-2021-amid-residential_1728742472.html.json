For the full year, sales are expected to come in at around 20,000 units, C&W said.\nMs Christine Li, C&W head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, said the residential collective sales market is back in focus after a three-year hiatus.\n\"Signs are pointing to a possible reactivation of collective sale tenders but the long gestation period makes government land sales and private plots a preferred choice at the moment,\" she said.\nC&W expects developers to sell about 9,800 to 10,000 residential units for the whole of 2020, which can potentially exceed the 9,912 units transacted in 2019 despite the challenging economic situation.\nExcluding related-party transactions, including real estate investment trust mergers, residential sales made up the bulk of investment sales activity for the whole of 2020 at 43 per cent.\nOffice assets remained a favoured asset class in 2020 and are poised for more transactions in 2021, Ms Li said. She noted a growing interest in office properties by institutional players, opportunistic private-equity investors, wealthy individuals and family offices.\nMeanwhile, Q4 2020 saw a strong pickup in shophouse investment sales, totalling $252 million, nearly six times that of the $44 million recorded in Q3 2020.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/single-owner-plots-older-cbd-office-sites-will-appeal-in-2021-amid-residential"}
