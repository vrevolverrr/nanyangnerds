And it depends fully on your choice... (the) choice whether we are indeed allies,” Mr Zelensky said in his speech.\nRussia has increased its long-range bombardment of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and its cities in recent weeks, ratcheting up the pressure on Kyiv as Moscow’s more numerous and better equipped forces slowly advance on the battlefield in the east.\nSo far in 2024, Mr Zelensky said, Ukraine had been attacked by almost 1,200 Russian missiles, more than 1,500 drones and 8,500 guided bombs, amid a slowdown in Western military assistance.\n“We are telling this directly – to defend, we need seven more Patriots, or similar air defence systems, and it’s a minimum number. They can save many lives and really change the situation,” he said.\nNato chief Jens Stoltenberg said after the meeting between allied defence ministers and Mr Zelensky that the allies had agreed to provide Kyiv with additional air defence systems.\n“In addition to Patriots, there are other weapons that allies can provide, including (the French system) SAMP/T, and many others, who do not have available systems, have pledged to provide financial support to purchase them for Ukraine,” Mr Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.\nUrgency\nMr Zelensky said Kyiv’s troops needed to receive long-range missiles and artillery shells now.\n“This year, we can’t wait for decisions to be made,” he said.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/ukraine-needs-at-least-seven-patriot-air-defence-systems-zelenskiy-tells-nato"}
