Progressive wages refers to a wage ladder pegged to productivity and skill improvements that now covers seven sectors and two occupations.\nThe meeting of the NWC, a body comprising employer, employee and government representatives, comes amid a mixed economic outlook.\nWhile Singapore’s 2024 growth forecast is now expected to come in at the upper end of the initially predicted range, risks such as geopolitical conflicts remain.\nNon-oil domestic exports fell 6.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2024 on the back of volatile pharmaceutical demand, faster than the 3.4 per cent decline in the previous quarter.\nThe manufacturing sector shrank, largely due to a contraction in biomedical manufacturing as pharmaceuticals output fell sharply.\nWage growth and inflation both slowed, which meant real total wages grew at 0.4 per cent in 2023, the same rate as in 2022.\nWhile employment and wages are expected to grow in tandem with an expected gradual pickup in Singapore’s economy, MOM has said continued growth in resident employment is likely to become more muted amid slowing resident workforce growth and low unemployment.\nPrevailing guidelines covering the year ending Nov 30, 2024, recommended that employers increase wages of lower-wage workers by between 5.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent, with a suggested minimum quantum of $85 to be provided by employers that have done well.\nThe council has 38 members, with 10 fresh faces including Mr Tan Hee Teck, the newly elected president of the Singapore National Employers Federation; labour MP and National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay; and Ms Julie Cheong, president of the Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/national-wages-council-to-convene-on-aug-29-seeks-views-on-annual-guidelines"}
