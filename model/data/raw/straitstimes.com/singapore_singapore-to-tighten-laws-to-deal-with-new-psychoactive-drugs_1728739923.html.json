She noted that arguments stating the death penalty is a failed deterrent due to the continued trafficking of drugs into Singapore are “disingenuous” and “illogical”.\nMrs Teo said there is “incontrovertible evidence” that the death penalty is an effective deterrent against drug trafficking.\n“When we interviewed convicted drug traffickers and analysed their operations, it shows clearly that the death penalty has featured in their calculations, and has significantly reduced the amount of drugs trafficked into Singapore.”\nShe added: “Surveys also show that a large majority of people living in our surrounding region agree that the death penalty has a deterrent effect.”\nIn October, British billionaire Richard Branson criticised the use of the death penalty to deter drug trafficking in Singapore in a blog post.\nMrs Teo urged the Home Team to help Singaporeans be more aware of the dangers of drugs, including cannabis, and to help counter the misleading propaganda that recreational use is harmless. “On our part, the Government will not waver in our tough approach against drug trafficking, including our use of the death penalty,” she said.\nResponding to calls for Singapore to relax laws regulating cannabis, following Thailand’s move to remove it from its list of illegal narcotic drugs, she said while there is some research that shows the potential uses of cannabinoids – a substance extracted from the cannabis plant – in managing medical conditions such as seizures and epilepsy, there was no scientific evidence as to the effectiveness of raw cannabis in doing the same.\n“Studies have shown that cannabis consumption is linked to brain damage and serious mental illness,” she noted.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-tighten-laws-to-deal-with-new-psychoactive-drugs"}
