The questionnaires have to be answered within a week, providing details such as investments and manufacturing capacities for EVs exported from China, according to a BMW spokesperson.\nThe request adds to evidence that the EU is gathering data not only from Chinese EV-makers such as Nio, BYD and SAIC Motor, but also from Western carmakers that manufacture there, as it assesses the degree of state support for the EV industry. Tesla’s exports from China are also a target of the anti-subsidy probe.\nThe investigation has the potential to reshape the competitive dynamics within Europe, the second-largest EV market after China, and raises the risk that its own carmakers could face potential retaliation and countervailing measures. BMW exported between 15,000 and 20,000 iX3 SUV’s from China last year.\n“Not only BMW stands to lose,” Mr Mertl said. “This will also impact all international carmakers who do business in China.”\n“The backlash, like a boomerang, can be bigger than what one imagined,” he said, referring to potential retaliation by China on European carmakers.\nGlobally, demand for BMW vehicles is still holding up, Mr Mertl said. Total sales rose more than 5 per cent during the first nine months compared to last year, he said. BMW’s world-wide EV sales gained by a “high double-digit percentage” rate in the last three months.\nBMW produces the electric iX3 SUV exclusively through BMW Brilliance Automotive, its joint venture in Shenyang, China. Starting next year, BMW also plans to produce electric Mini Cooper vehicles in China for export to Europe with its partner Great Wall Motor.\nThrough the first seven months of this year, Tesla sold an estimated 93,700 made-in-China vehicles across Western Europe, accounting for roughly 47 per cent of its total deliveries, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.\nThe next biggest exporter of EVs from China to Europe was SAIC’s MG, with roughly 57,500 registrations. Renault, which makes the electric Dacia Spring in China for export, has not said whether it has been contacted about the probe.
