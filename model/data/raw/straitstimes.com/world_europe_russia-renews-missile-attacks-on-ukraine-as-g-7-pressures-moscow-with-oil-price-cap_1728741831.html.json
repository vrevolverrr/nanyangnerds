Buildings have been hit in the suburbs of the city of Zaporizhzhia and some Russian missiles have been shot down, a city official said.\nThe governor of the Kyiv region said its air defences are working there, and told residents to remain in shelters. An energy provider said power has been knocked out on the northern region of Sumy in the latest missile strikes.\nRussian forces have increasingly targeted Ukrainian energy facilities in recent weeks as they face setbacks on the battlefield, causing major power outages as winter sets in.\n“Don’t ignore the alarm,” said Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential staff.\nUkraine has only just returned to scheduled power outages from Monday rather than the emergency blackouts it has suffered since widespread Russian strikes on Nov 23, the worst of the attacks on energy infrastructure that began in early October.\nRussia has said the attacks are designed to degrade Ukraine’s military. Ukraine says they are clearly aimed at civilians and thus constitute a war crime.\nMeanwhile, Western countries are trying to Russia’s ability to finance its invasion by imposing a price cap on Russian seaborne oil.\nA US$60 (S$81) per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil came into force on Monday. Russia is the world’s second-largest oil exporter.\nThe agreement allows Russian oil to be shipped to third-party countries using G-7 and EU tankers, insurance companies and credit institutions, only if the cargo is bought at or below the US$60 per barrel cap.\nMoscow has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said US$60 is too high to stop Russia’s assault.\nA Russian oil blend was selling for around US$79 a barrel in Asian markets on Monday - almost a third higher than the price cap, according to Refinitiv data and estimates from industry sources.\nOn the ground in Ukraine, both sides reported casualties from attacks overnight, on an industrial enterprise and another location in southern Ukraine and on state-run accommodation in Russian-held territory in the east. Reuters has not been able to immediately verify those reports.
