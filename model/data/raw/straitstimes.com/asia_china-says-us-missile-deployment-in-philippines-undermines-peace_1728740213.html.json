China has demanded its removal, and Russia has joined in condemning the first deployment of the system to the Indo-Pacific, accusing Washington of fuelling an arms race.\nMr Wang said the deployment “is not in the interests of regional countries”.\nThe Philippines, southern neighbour to Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory, is an important part of US strategy in Asia and would be an indispensable staging point for the military to aid Taipei in the event of a Chinese attack.\nMr Wang said exchanges and cooperation between China and South Korea have become more active this year.
