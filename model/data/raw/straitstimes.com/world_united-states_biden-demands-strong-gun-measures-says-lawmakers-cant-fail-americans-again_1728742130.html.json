Just do something. For God's sake, do something.\"\nThe US, which has a higher rate of gun deaths than any other wealthy nation, has been shaken in recent weeks by the high-profile mass shootings at a grocery story in New York, an elementary school in Texas that killed 19 children, and a medical building in Oklahoma.\nGun safety advocates have pushed Mr Biden to take stronger measures on his own to curb gun violence, but the White House wants Congress to pass legislation that would have more lasting impact than any presidential order.\nA US House of Representatives committee on Thursday was working on a Bill aimed at toughening national gun laws, though the measure has little chance of passing the Senate.\nMr Biden's evening address was aimed at putting further pressure on lawmakers and keeping the issue at the forefront of voters' minds. He has made only a handful of evening speeches from the White House during his term, including one on the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 and one about the Texas shooting last week.\nMore than 18,000 people have died from gun violence in the US in 2022, including through homicide and suicide, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit research group.\nCanada, Australia and Britain all passed stricter gun laws after mass shootings in their countries, banning assault weapons and increasing background checks. America has experienced two decades of massacres in schools, stores and places of work and worship without any such legislation.\nA broad majority of American voters, both Republicans and Democrats, favour stronger gun control laws, but Republicans in Congress and some moderate Democrats have blocked such legislation for years.\nPrices of shares in gun manufacturers rose on Thursday.\nEfforts to advance gun control measures have boosted firearm share prices after other mass shootings as investors anticipated that gun purchases would increase ahead of stricter regulations.\nMr Biden has called on Congress to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and pass measures to require universal background checks for those who buy guns.\nIn the aftermath of the Texas shooting, he urged the country to take on the powerful pro-gun lobby that backs politicians who oppose such legislation.\nThe Senate is split, with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, and a law must have 60 votes to overcome a manoeuvre known as the filibuster, which means any law would need rare bipartisan support.\n\"The only room in America where you can't find more than 60 per cent support for universal background checks is on the floor of the US Senate,\" said Mr Christian Heyne, vice-president for policy at Brady, a gun violence prevention group.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/biden-demands-strong-gun-measures-says-lawmakers-cant-fail-americans-again"}
