You can, for example:\nMake a tunnel using cardboard boxes for kids to crawl through.\nMark a zigzag path on the floor using masking tape for them to stay on course.\nLine up cushions on the floor as “debris” for them to hop over.\nAdd a tossing stop and sneak some hand-eye coordination and numeracy skills into the obstacle course. They can use crushed paper balls imaginatively as water to put out the “fire”. Count aloud the number of balls that make it into a laundry basket.\nAmp up the game atmosphere by playing sound effects from your mobile phone, such as sirens, and sticking cutouts of flames on the walls.\nYou and your kids can also create a simple firefighter costume and make toy fire extinguishers.\nHover Over The Orchid\nContributed by teacher Faridah Razali, PCF Sparkletots @ Paya Lebar Block 23\nThis activity is designed to acquaint children with Singapore’s places of interest and national flower Vanda Miss Joaquim. At the same time, kids can practise counting and work on physical movements, such as jumping.\nBefore you start, draw or print pictures of five orchid petals and five matching sets of local attractions. You will also need a die.\nArrange the petals in a circle and place a different attraction next to it. Put the duplicate pictures of attractions in the middle.\nTo play, your kids can choose where they want to stand. You then roll the die to determine the number of steps they have to jump in your preferred direction (for example, five steps to your left).\nAsk them to name the place where they have landed and talk about it. Then, find its matching picture in the middle.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/fun-with-kids-sharity-themed-scavenger-hunt-physical-play-ideas-for-pre-schoolers"}
