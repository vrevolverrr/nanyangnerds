As couples age, parenting can be more challenging, which could lower the probability of having multiple children.\nFurthermore, there is also the psychosocial aspect if pregnancy does not materialise, heightening anxiety and pressure as couples race against their biological clock.\nAdditionally, advanced-age pregnancies carry a higher risk of clinical complications, hence increasing healthcare costs.\nThen, there are realities of fertility struggles in Singapore. Couples spend an average of 3.4 years attempting to conceive naturally, compounded by delays in marriage and age-related fertility decline.\nAssisted reproduction, or in vitro fertilisation (IVF), is the most common option. However, there lies another obstacle – the foreseeable treatment costs relative to the success rates of IVF pregnancies.\nMost Singaporeans and transnational couples will turn to public hospitals, as co-funding is a benefit. However, there is a waiting time, considering their heavy patient load.\nAs we await a proposed extension of co-funding to private fertility clinics to be duly considered, what other options are available for couples who want to heed the call to start a family earlier? Can private fertility clinics fill the gap and better support couples’ aspirations at a cost that they can afford and the same patient quality?\nNotably, IVF may be an option for some, but it is also not the only solution. Understanding one’s fertility status and available options is essential to decide the time to start a family.\nBy supporting couples and fostering a culture of proactive family planning, we can continue the legacy of a vibrant Singapore, not just with the arrival of “Dragon babies” but many more healthy babies of different zodiac signs.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/letter-of-the-week-foster-a-culture-of-proactive-family-planning-to-boost-birth-rate"}
