It can have serious, even life-threatening consequences.\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in Singapore, with a prevalence of 4 per cent among adults aged 50 and above.\nThe latest Singapore Stroke Registry Report in 2020 stated that the disease accounted for 8 per cent of deaths here. It is also the biggest cause of long-term disability, which includes impaired speech, restricted physical abilities, weakness or paralysis of limbs on one side of the body, and a slowed ability to communicate.\nWhile stroke is more common in older people, it can occur to anyone at any age. The Stroke Registry Report showed there was a rise in incidence rates among people aged 30 to 49 between 2010 and 2020.\nThe rate for those aged 30 to 39 increased from 20.9 per 100,000 population to 21.1. And for those between the ages of 40 and 49, it rose from 71.9 to 96.1.\nMs Liow, who works in human resources, belongs to the first group. She was diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension in 2016 after giving birth to her son.\nIn November 2022, she had her first stroke, which was not diagnosed, and she was discharged from hospital.\nShe had a second stroke a month later.\n“I was told the second stroke was an asthma attack, and I was discharged after two days in the ward,” she said. “It was only after I took a course in first aid that I realised the symptoms I had then – dizziness, numbness in the face and loss of speech – were from a stroke.”", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/stroke-survivors-annual-walkathon-to-raise-awareness-of-the-condition-in-s-pore"}
