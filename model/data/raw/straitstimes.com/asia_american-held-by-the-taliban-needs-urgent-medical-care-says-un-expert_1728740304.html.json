She said she had raised the issue directly with the Taliban.\n“Without adequate medical care he is at risk of irreparable harm or even death,” she said.\nMr Corbett and his family moved to Afghanistan in 2010. He worked with non-governmental organisations and then started his own – Bloom Afghanistan – to bolster the country's private sector through consulting, micro-finance and project evaluation.\nHe left with his family following the Taliban takeover in 2021, but he continued working with his organisation and went back in January 2022 to renew his business visa.\nDespite having a valid visa, he was arrested by the Taliban in August 2022 after he returned to pay and train his staff, his lawyers have said.\nA German and two Afghans with whom Mr Corbett was arrested have since been released.\nThe UN expert said that Mr Corbett has developed several medical problems, including ringing in his ears, and severe weight loss. He has also repeatedly expressed intentions of suicide and self-harm.\nThe US has had no diplomatic presence in Kabul since it fell to the Taliban in August 2021 as US troops pulled out after 20 years of war.
