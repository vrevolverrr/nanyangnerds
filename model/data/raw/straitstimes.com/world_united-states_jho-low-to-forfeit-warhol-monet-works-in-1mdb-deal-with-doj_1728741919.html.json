He was spotted in 2023 in Macau.\nLow was charged in absentia in 2018 by a Malaysian court with eight counts of money laundering and issued a warrant of arrest for his role in 1MDB.\nA separate Malaysian court said in 2020 that he played a key role in transferring RM42 million (S$12.07 million) from a former 1MDB unit to Najib’s accounts.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/jho-low-to-forfeit-warhol-monet-works-in-1mdb-deal-with-doj"}
