In fact, SCDF personnel are on the front lines every day risking their lives battling fires, rescuing people, handling hazardous materials and providing medical treatment and casualty evacuation like in the case of this mass food poisoning incident.\nAs National Day approaches, we must show more appreciation for our brave SCDF personnel who labour tirelessly around the clock to keep our nation safe.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-scdf-s-fast-response-and-contingency-resources-on-full-display"}
