Emergency services are working to control fires at the sites that were hit,\" Oleg Synegubov said in a statement on social media.\nThe head of the Dnipropetrovsk region Dmytro Reznichenko also said Russian forces were responsible for blackouts across his region. \"Several cities and communities in the Dnipropetrovsk region are without electricity.\nThe Russians hit energy infrastructure. They cannot accept defeat on the battlefield,\" he said in a statement online. The head of the eastern Sumy region meanwhile said the cuts to electricity and water supplies had impacted at least 135 towns and villages.\nAFP journalists in the Donetsk regional city of Kramatorsk meanwhile confirmed the cuts were also impacting one of the largest cities in the east still under Ukrainian control. Its governor had also reported cuts across the region, which has been partially controlled by Moscow-backed separatist since 2014.
