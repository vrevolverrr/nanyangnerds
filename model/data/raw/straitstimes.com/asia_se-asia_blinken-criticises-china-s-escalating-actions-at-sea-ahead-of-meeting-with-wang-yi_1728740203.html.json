They see it as... an internal China issue,” said the official, who briefed reporters travelling with Mr Blinken.\nChina’s government considers democratically ruled Taiwan as inviolable Chinese territory, which the island rejects.\nMr Wang told Mr Blinken that Taiwan was part of China and “was not and will not be a country”, and Beijing would counter provocations by forces advocating Taiwan’s independence, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.\nHe said that though communication channels between China and the US were open, Washington had intensified its efforts to contain and suppress Beijing.\n“The risks facing Sino-US relations are still accumulating, and the challenges are rising and ties are at a critical juncture of halting their decline and achieving stability,” Mr Wang said.\nThe two talked for one hour and 20 minutes on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos, in their sixth meeting since June 2023, when Mr Blinken visited Beijing in a significant sign of improvement in strained relations between the world’s two biggest economies.\nThey did not set a date for their next meeting, the US official said.\nMr Blinken is touring East Asia in a bid to reassure countries close to China of US commitment, despite political uncertainty at home.\nHe travelled to Vietnam later on July 27 and was set to hold security talks alongside Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin in Japan and the Philippines in the coming days.\nMr Blinken conveyed to Mr Wang that US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential candidate, both believed in the importance of stability in the US-China relationship, and that a rules-based order must be upheld, the official added.\nMr Blinken also discussed China’s support for Russia’s defence industrial base and warned of further US actions if China does not curtail that, according to the official.\nWashington has levied sanctions at targets including China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of an effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n“There was no commitment by the Chinese to take action,” the official said.\nMr Blinken also raised with Mr Wang US concerns over human rights in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet.\nHe also stressed the need for more progress from Beijing on counter-narcotics operations including on fentanyl precursors coming out of China.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/blinken-criticises-china-s-escalating-actions-at-sea-ahead-of-meeting-with-wang-yi"}
