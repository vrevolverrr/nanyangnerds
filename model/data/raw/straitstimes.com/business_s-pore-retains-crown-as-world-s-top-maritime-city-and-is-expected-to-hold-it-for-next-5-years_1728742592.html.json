It made significant progress in the Finance and Law pillar, rising from eighth position to finish fourth behind London, New York and Oslo.\nIn overall ranking, Singapore was trailed by Athens, Tokyo, Shanghai and Hamburg.\nThe report said Hong Kong, which ranked fourth in 2019, has now fallen to 12th place. Athens has also experienced a significant drop in the total ranking, even though it is still No. 2 when it comes to the Shipping pillar.\nOn the other hand, the Middle East, despite war and turmoil in the region, has strengthened its position. Dubai improved its position to 11th overall since the previous edition. Abu Dhabi made the most remarkable jump, moving up 10 places from 32 to 22, said the report.\nThe 2024 edition of LMC introduced new indicators to address the transformative effect of decarbonisation and digitalisation. “As the industry embraces new and cutting-edge technologies, the impact of these two dimensions cuts across the five pillars that the cities are benchmarked on,” it said.\nThe report said maritime industry experts voted Singapore, Oslo, Shanghai and Rotterdam to be the cities best prepared for the digital transformation of the industry.\n“Singapore’s investment and focus on maritime decarbonisation has also further consolidated its position as the world’s leading centre for green technologies and solutions, followed by Oslo and Rotterdam.” it said.\nThe report said the global shipping industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of the war in Ukraine, simmering disputes in the South China Sea and the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea.\nThe trajectory for the industry is optimistic, with global trade likely to grow by more than 2 per cent between 2024 and 2028.\nThe LMC report said the world’s climate crisis has also become another major force driving change, leading to a significant shift in attitudes globally and especially within the maritime community.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/s-pore-retains-crown-as-world-s-top-maritime-city-and-is-expected-to-hold-it-for-next-5-years"}
