Sabah Umno in December 2018 lost six MPs, nine state assemblymen and two senators. Many defected to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, a PH component party.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/umno-names-candidate-for-closely-watched-kimanis-by-election-in-sabah-on-jan-18"}
