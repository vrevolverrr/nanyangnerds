The UN says more than a million have been made homeless.\n“You see Gaza now from a distance, you will soon see it from inside. The command will come,” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told troops gathered at the Gaza border on Thursday.\nOn Friday, he told a parliamentary committee that one objective of the military campaign in the Gaza Strip is to end Israel’s responsibility over the Palestinian coastal enclave.\n“Gallant detailed the objectives of the campaign including the elimination of Hamas and destruction of both its military and governing capabilities, the complete removal of Israeli responsibility from the Gaza Strip, and the creation of a new security reality in the region,” a statement from Mr Gallant’s office said.\nIsrael has already told all civilians to evacuate the northern half of the Gaza Strip, which includes Gaza City.\nMany people have yet to leave saying they fear losing everything and have nowhere safe to go with southern areas also under attack.\n“They felt they would be safe here. They came from under the bombardment and the destruction, and they said they would be safe here but destruction chased them,” a man cried out.\nGaza’s Hamas-run government media office said 18 Christian Palestinians had been killed, while the health ministry later gave a toll of 16.\nThere was no immediate word from the church on the final death toll.\nIt said targeting churches that were used as shelters for people fleeing bombing was “a war crime that cannot be ignored”.\nThe Israeli military said part of the church was damaged in a strike on a militant command centre and it was reviewing the incident.\n‘Everything I dreamt of destroyed’\nIn Zahra, a northern Gaza town, residents said their entire district of some 25 multi-storey apartment buildings was razed to the ground.\nThey received Israeli warning messages on their mobile phones at breakfast time, followed 10 minutes later by a small drone strike that hammered the message home.\nHalf an hour after the initial warning, F-16 warplanes brought the buildings down in huge explosions and clouds of dust.\n“Everything I ever dreamt of and thought that I have achieved was gone. In that apartment was my dream, my memories with my children, and my wife, was the smell of safety and love,” Mr Ali, a resident of the district, told Reuters by phone, declining to give his full name for fear of reprisals.\nThe United Nations humanitarian affairs office said more than 140,000 homes - nearly a third of all homes in Gaza - have been damaged, with nearly 13,000 completely destroyed.\nThe south of the enclave has also been regularly hit. The Gaza authorities said there were several dead and wounded in fresh strikes on Khan Younis, the enclave’s main southern city.\nOther fronts in Lebanon, West Bank\nWhile Israeli troops are massing around Gaza in anticipation of an order to invade, conflict is also spreading to two other fronts - the West Bank and the northern border with Lebanon.\nThe defence ministry ordered residents of the largest Israeli town near the Lebanese border, Kiryat Shmona, to evacuate to guest houses.\nClashes at the border between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement have been the deadliest since a full-blown war in 2006.\nIn the West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said 13 people were killed, including five children, after Israeli troops raided and called in air strikes on the Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarm.\nThe territory, where Palestinians have limited self rule under Israeli military occupation, has seen the deadliest clashes since the second intifada, or uprising, ended in 2005.\nDiplomats fear the conflict could spread even further.\nThe Pentagon on Thursday said a US Navy warship operating in the northern Red Sea intercepted three cruise missiles and several drones launched by the Houthi movement in Yemen, potentially towards Israel.\nThe Houthi, like Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, are backed by Iran.\nTeheran has lauded the Hamas attacks on Israel though it denies being behind them.\nMeanwhile, the USS Mount Whitney, a sophisticated command, control, communication and intelligence ship, was heading to the eastern Mediterranean to join a host of US warships already there, the US Navy said.\nThe US Defence Department told members of Congress at a briefing on Wednesday that it intends to send its two Iron Dome missile defence systems back to Israel as part of a leaseback deal, having experimented with the systems for several years.
