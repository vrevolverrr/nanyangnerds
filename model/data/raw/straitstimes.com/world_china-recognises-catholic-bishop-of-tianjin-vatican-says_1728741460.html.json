The ceremony took place in a hotel rather than a church, to stress that Shi had already been ordained a bishop decades ago, the report said.\nThe Vatican and Beijing are due to decide this autumn whether to renew their agreement over bishop appointments. The Vatican's chief diplomat, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, had said in May that the church hoped to renew it.
