Kagan said in the statement.\nThe office of Malaysia’s Prime Minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMalaysian and US investigators estimate US$4.5 billion was siphoned away from 1MDB following its inception in 2009, implicating former prime minister Najib Razak, Goldman Sachs staff and high-level officials elsewhere.
