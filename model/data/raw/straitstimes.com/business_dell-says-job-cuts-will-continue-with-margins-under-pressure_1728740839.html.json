This new spigot of growth has excited investors – the stock has gained 39 per cent in 2024 to the Sept 10 close and will join the S&P 500 Index later in September.\nStill, there is increasing concern about the profitability of the equipment sold by Dell and peers such as Super Micro Computer and Hewlett Packard Enterprise because the servers need expensive computer chips made by companies like Nvidia. In the most recent quarter, Dell said that a higher mix of AI servers hurt margins, but reported improved profit compared with the previous period.\nThe company’s better-known business, the sale of PCs, has not picked up as much as anticipated after a two-year slump. Dell on Aug 30 reported US$12.4 billion (S$16.1 billion) in fiscal second-quarter revenue, down 4 per cent from the same period a year earlier and slightly missing estimates. Sales of business PCs were little changed, while revenue from consumer-oriented PCs declined 22 per cent from a year earlier.\n“We remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business transformation initiatives and will continue to take certain measures to reduce costs,” Dell said on Sept 10 in a regulatory filing.\nThe company declined to comment beyond the filing.\nIn June, Dell cut jobs primarily in sales without disclosing how many workers would be affected. The company took a US$328 million charge for severance expenses in the quarter. Dell said in February that it had about 120,000 full-time workers globally.
