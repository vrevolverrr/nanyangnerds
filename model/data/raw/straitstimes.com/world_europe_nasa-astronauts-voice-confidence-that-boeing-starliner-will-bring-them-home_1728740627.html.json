While non-combustible, helium provides pressure to the propulsion system.\nSeparately, some of Starliner’s thrusters that provide fine manoeuvring initially failed to kick in, delaying docking. Engineers are not sure why the craft’s computer “deselected” these thrusters, though they were able to restart most of them.\nThe crew insisted that Starliner could fly home in case there was an emergency, since the problems affected only the fine manoeuvring thrusters and not those responsible for the deorbit burn that would bring the spaceship back into the atmosphere.\nTeething issues with new spaceships are not uncommon.\nBut the Starliner programme has suffered from comparisons with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. Both companies were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to provide the US space agency with rides to the ISS, with SpaceX succeeding in 2020 and carrying dozens of people since.
