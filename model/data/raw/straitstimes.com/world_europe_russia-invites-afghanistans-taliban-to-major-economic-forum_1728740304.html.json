It was one of the factions fighting a civil war for control of the country following the withdrawal of the Soviet Union and subsequent collapse of the government.\nIt originally drew members from so-called \"mujahideen\" fighters who, with support from the United States, repelled Soviet forces in the 1980s.\nIn 2003, Russia formally labelled the Taliban a terrorist organisation, though it had periodic informal contacts with the movement.
