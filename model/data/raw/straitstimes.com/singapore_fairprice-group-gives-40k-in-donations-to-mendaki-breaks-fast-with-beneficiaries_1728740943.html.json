We’ll do our best to be alongside our workers to manage the cost of living,” said NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng. He attended the event and witnessed the presentation of the cheque, along with Focus Area 4 task force chairman Fahmi Aliman.\nThe gathering also marked the first distribution of community care packs from FairPrice Group’s 50th anniversary staff donation drive in 2023, which raised $27,600 in total. Each attendee received a care pack that included pineapple tarts, dates, chicken curry paste, and $200 worth of FairPrice and Kopitiam vouchers to help defray food expenses, said the group.\nFairPrice Group will host another buka puasa event on April 4, at Selarang Halfway House, in partnership with the Singapore Prison Service and Bapa Sepanjang Hayat. The event will give ex-offenders a chance to reconnect with their families during Ramadan, the foundation said.\nOther upcoming festive activities organised by FairPrice Group include two block parties, in Bedok North and Bukit Batok, on April 20.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fairprice-group-gives-40k-in-donations-to-mendaki-breaks-fast-with-beneficiaries"}
