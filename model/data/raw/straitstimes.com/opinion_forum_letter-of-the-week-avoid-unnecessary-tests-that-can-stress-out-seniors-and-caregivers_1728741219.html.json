Sept 5). This is a reality many of us are grappling with, and it’s heartening to see this issue being highlighted.\nCaring for a loved one, especially an elderly person, can be incredibly stressful. The emotional connection and sense of responsibility can make it hard for caregivers to step back and take care of themselves.\nAs our population ages, more and more seniors find themselves in the position of caring for their loved ones. While this is a noble responsibility, it can also be physically and emotionally exhausting. The burden of caregiving, particularly for those who may already be dealing with their own health issues, is significant.\nDoctors do play a crucial role in lightening this load.\nBeyond just providing medical care, they can offer guidance on managing caregiving stress, refer patients to relevant support services and even advocate for policies that provide more comprehensive assistance to caregivers.\nIf patients do not present themselves with clinical pathologies that warrant further investigation, there may be no need to search for medical solutions that may not offer relief or improve their quality of life.\nPursuing extensive tests or treatments when there is no clear clinical indication can lead to unnecessary stress for both the patient and caregiver. It can also result in treatments that might be invasive or have side effects, without providing real benefits.\nBoth time and financial resources are often limited, especially for seniors. By avoiding unnecessary medical investigations, these resources can be conserved and directed towards interventions that truly matter, such as improving the patient’s daily experiences or supporting the caregiver.\nThis approach can also ease the caregivers’ burden, as it lets them concentrate on the aspects of care that truly make a difference.\nBy working together with doctors, we can ensure that senior caregivers are supported, and their burdens eased.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/letter-of-the-week-avoid-unnecessary-tests-that-can-stress-out-seniors-and-caregivers"}
