He was later issued an isolation order for him to be detained and isolated in a room at D’Resort for about a month.\nHe shared a room with a 24-year-old man, and still tested positive for Covid-19 on April 16, 2020.\nIn the early hours of April 18, 2020, Fabian could not sleep and decided to leave D’Resort without permission, in breach of the order.\nClosed-circuit television footage shows him leaving his room at 2.55am.\nHe walked to a fence that separated D’Resort from Pasir Ris Park, and stepped on a fire hydrant to climb over the fence.\nWhen confronted later by his roommate about his actions, Fabian made light of the risks, saying he had been “escaping the law since 1993”.\nHe returned to D’Resort only at around 4.50pm, after spending time at the park and beach.\nOn Wednesday, District Judge Prem Raj noted that while the beach was closed to the public at the time, the park was still accessible.\nHe added that the breach took place just 11 days after Singapore had imposed a circuit breaker to contain the spread of Covid-19, and some eight months before vaccines were available here.\nThe judge said the offences must be seen against the backdrop of a time when not much was known about the virus, which was a potentially fatal threat.\nFabian has been offered bail of $5,000, and is expected to begin serving his sentence from March 29.\nFor breaching the isolation order, he could have been jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-sia-steward-who-breached-isolation-order-after-testing-positive-for-covid-19"}
