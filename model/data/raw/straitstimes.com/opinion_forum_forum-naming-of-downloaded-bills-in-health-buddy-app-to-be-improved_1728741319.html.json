We understand Mr Chern’s concern about the current file-naming format for downloaded bills and are taking in his suggestion to name them in a clearer and more identifiable format.\nWe also plan to enable editable extensions to the file names of downloaded documents such as bills in the Health Buddy app, so that users can customise them according to their preference. This refinement will offer more flexibility to aid the effective documentation and retrieval of bills, according to a person’s needs.\nWe aim to deploy these updates in the next few months and appreciate users’ understanding as we work through the necessary technical adjustments. We look forward to giving Mr Chern, and our over 2.5 million patients and their caregivers who use the app, a more user-friendly Health Buddy experience. We welcome users to write to us at marcom@singhealth.com.sg with suggestions on improving the app.\nOnce again, we thank Mr Chern for his feedback.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-naming-of-downloaded-bills-in-health-buddy-app-to-be-improved"}
