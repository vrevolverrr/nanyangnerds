The UN has acknowledged these figures as reliable.\nAl-Hayya said that a year after the Oct 7 attack, “all of Palestine, particularly Gaza, and our Palestinian people are writing a new history with their resistance, blood and steadfastness”.\nThe Hamas member, who has emerged as the Islamist group’s public face following the killing of its former leader Ismail Haniyeh in July, said Gazans had remained “resilient to all attempts at displacement... despite the kinds of torture and terrorism you have endured, and the horrific genocide and daily massacre”.
