Its share price fell 1.9 per cent on Monday versus a 1.1 per cent rise in the broader market.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nFoxconn is Apple’s biggest iPhone maker, producing 70 per cent of iPhone shipments globally that, in turn, make up 45 per cent of the Taiwanese firm’s revenue.\nAny disruption at Zhengzhou threatens to snarl Apple’s finely orchestrated supply chain. Thousands of components from Europe to Asia are shipped into Zhengzhou, assembled manually into devices, then shuttled off to the rest of the world.\nStrict measures\nUnder China’s ultra-strict zero-Covid-19 policies, places must act swiftly to quell outbreaks, with measures including full-scale lockdowns.\nFactories in affected areas are often allowed to stay open on condition that they operate under a “closed loop” system where staff live and work on-site. Businesses have said such arrangements pose numerous difficulties.\nFoxconn on Oct 19 banned dining at canteens at the Zhengzhou plant and required workers to eat meals in dormitories. It said production was normal.\nThe measures led to people, who said they worked at the site, venting frustration about their treatment and provisions via social media.\nScores fled the site over the weekend, with photographs and videos on social media purporting showing Foxconn staff trekking across fields in daytime and along roads at night. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the posts.\nFoxconn and that local authorities have not disclosed the number of infected workers at the site. Zhengzhou, capital of central Henan province, has since Oct 19 reported 264 locally transmitted Covid-19 cases.\nFoxconn implemented closed-loop measures in March and July this year at its smaller Shenzhen factory as cases in the southern city rose.\nClosed loops enable companies to stay operational during lockdowns but take a toll on workers, whose movements are severely limited, with some even required to sleep on factory floors. Tesla used a closed loop to resume output during Shanghai’s restive lockdown earlier this year.\nIn May, the Shanghai plant of another Apple supplier, MacBook assembler Quanta Computer, was also hit by worker chaos after the discovery of Covid-19 cases despite a closed-loop system being put in place.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/output-of-apple-iphones-at-major-china-plant-could-fall-30-amid-covid-19-curbs-source"}
