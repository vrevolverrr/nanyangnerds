This group also includes the Leader of the Opposition, election candidates and their election agents, and central executive committee members of political parties.\nA person or group can become designated PSPs if the authorities assess that their activities are directed towards a political end, and that it is in the public interest that they be subjected to Fica’s measures to mitigate the risk of foreign interference.\nQ: Why these particular groups?\nA: There has been a slew of examples in recent years of countries attempting to subvert other countries, helped by modern technology and communication tools, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said in Parliament on Oct 4, 2021, at the second reading of the Bill.\nThe examples he cited of influence operations included a former Australian senator, who in 2017 was found to have received donations from a source with ties to the Chinese government. He then advocated China’s position on the South China Sea.\nIn another case, a chairman of a European Union foreign friendship group received kickbacks from a foreign government and later voiced support for its policies.\nMr Shanmugam noted that this has also happened in Singapore, highlighting the case of academic Huang Jing.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/askst-what-is-a-politically-significant-person-and-other-questions-about-s-pore-s-foreign-interference-law"}
