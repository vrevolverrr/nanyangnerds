The WHO has called on employers to take urgent action by introducing comprehensive well-being programmes to tackle the escalating mental health crisis in the workplace.\nBut the problem is that many workplace well-being programmes don’t work.\nA British study which looked at 46,336 employees from 233 organisations found there was no evidence that a range of common workplace well-being initiatives – including mindfulness and stress management classes, one-to-one mental health coaching, well-being apps or volunteering work – improved employee well-being.\nSo, despite companies investing over US$60 billion annually worldwide in well-being programmes, they appear to make little impact.\nThere are a number of reasons why these programmes don’t work – and understanding them is the only way companies will be able to make these programmes effective.\nMotivation crucial\nOrganisations often opt for easy-to-implement initiatives, such as hosting well-being talks or offering mindfulness or yoga classes. They then complain that employees don’t attend or don’t appreciate them.\nMany employees say they don’t attend these activities because they find them irrelevant, unhelpful, or they don’t value them enough to attend – meaning their workplace has failed in identifying their needs.\nUnderstanding what motivates people to participate in well-being programmes is crucial in improving their effectiveness.\nFor example, one survey found employees were more interested in learning about healthy lifestyles than having a discussion about stress management. Although not directly related to mental well-being, prioritising these kinds of talks would have a greater effect on improving well-being in the end.\nContent matters\nWell-being programmes tend to be more effective for people whose well-being is average or below average.\nSo when people with high levels of well-being participate in such programmes, they often see little benefit.\nThis can make it appear the programme isn’t effective – when in reality, it still is for those who need it most.\nThis is why it’s so important to determine what type of help employees need most when designing well-being programmes.\nFor employees who aren’t experiencing poor mental health, a programme that primarily addresses depression or anxiety may be less effective, as they’re probably already practising many of the strategies such programmes would discuss.\nBut if the well-being programme goes beyond reducing symptoms and focuses on promoting flourishing, meaning and purpose in life, it could provide value to a broader audience.\nThis is where a programme designed by an expert in positive psychology would be beneficial in workplaces.\nPositive psychology is the science of well-being.\nIt focuses on building on the positive aspects of life that make life worth living – rather than solely addressing symptoms of mental ill health, which affect only 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the population.\nBut positive psychology measures still have a positive impact on those who experience mental health issues at the same time.\nThey include such activities as identifying and using your character strengths at work, rethinking your past events positively, learning optimism or practising gratitude.\nThe content of workplace well-being programmes is crucial. Avoiding generic self-help approaches will enhance their overall impact.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/here-s-how-to-make-workplace-well-being-programmes-better"}
