This was mainly thanks to temporary supply disruptions and weak private investment in the first quarter.\nThe euro area meanwhile is showing signs of recovery, with relatively strong services activity, Prof Gourinchas said, although manufacturing shows weakness.\nChina and India are expected to power activity in Asia – with China’s 2024 forecast revised up to 5 per cent on a private consumption rebound and strong exports.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/imf-maintains-2024-global-growth-forecast-warns-of-inflation-risk"}
