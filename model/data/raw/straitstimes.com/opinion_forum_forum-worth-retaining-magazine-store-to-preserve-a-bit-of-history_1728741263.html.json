Besides the sentimental and emotional feelings many have for the store, there are broader reasons why we should preserve it and give it a special place in the heart of Holland Village where it has stood with quiet dignity for eight decades.\nNot many businesses this size, run by the same family, can survive that long, through times of turbulence and peace. The store is a lesson in resilience, survival and true grit.\nIt took much strength, perseverance and a positive spirit to sustain this unique store through three generations. We salute the generations of Sam’s family who made this possible.\nPreserving the store will give the young much to learn from and bring comfort to older customers.\nSuch old familiar sights and businesses give many people a sense of familiarity, belonging and continuity.\nThese are the threads that run in the fabric of our society, the gel that binds people together, especially amid the hectic, changing pace of Singapore.\nI appeal to commercial landlords, merchants and others in Holland Village to consider offering a viable retail space to Sam for his magazine store.\nThis will help preserve such heritage and retain an icon that has endeared itself to many Singaporeans.\nWe stand to lose more than what can be gained by letting it disappear into history.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-worth-retaining-magazine-store-to-preserve-a-bit-of-history"}
