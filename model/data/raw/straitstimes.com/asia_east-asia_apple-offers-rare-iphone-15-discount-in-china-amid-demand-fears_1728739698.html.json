But it has not cut prices on the newest iPhones in years.\nThe discounts this year encompass everything from the iPhone 13 to the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nApple will also offer savings on devices including the MacBook Air, most iPad models, some AirPods and the Apple Watch SE, according to its website. The company is knocking as much as 800 yuan off the MacBook Air’s price tag.
