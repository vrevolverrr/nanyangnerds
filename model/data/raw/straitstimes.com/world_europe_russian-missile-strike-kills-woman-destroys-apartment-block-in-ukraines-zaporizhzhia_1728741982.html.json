Stay in shelters!\" Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, told residents on the Telegram messaging app.\nHe later told Ukrainian television that one woman was killed in the overnight shelling, but said another woman who was earlier reported dead had survived.\nTwelve people were wounded, including a three-year-old child. Five were still under the rubble, he added.\nPhotographs released by Ukrainian emergency services showed huge piles of rubble where residential buildings had been hit.\nThe missile strikes underlined Moscow's ability to strike Ukrainian cities despite recent Russian setbacks in the war.\nRussia did not immediately comment on the events in Zaporizhzhia, which is under the control of Ukrainian forces.\nMoscow has denied deliberately targeting civilians in its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\nZaporizhzhia is one of the four Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia. Ukraine says it will never accept an illegal seizure of its territory by force. Kyiv and the West said the referendums were rigged votes held at gunpoint.\nPresident Vladimir Putin has ordered the Russian state to seize control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe's biggest, which is still run by Ukrainian engineers despite being captured early in the war by Russian forces.\nThe power station is close to the front line, on a Russian-controlled bank of a reservoir with Ukrainian forces on the opposite bank.\nBoth sides have warned of the danger of a potential nuclear disaster if the plant is hit.
