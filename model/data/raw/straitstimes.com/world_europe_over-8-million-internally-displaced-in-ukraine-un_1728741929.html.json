Sixty-three per cent of current IDPs are estimated to be women.\nAlmost half of the IDPs have fled their homes in the eastern region of Ukraine, where Russia is now concentrating its assault.\nMore than 3.9 million people are estimated to have fled their homes in the east; 1.65 million have fled the Kyiv region and 1.3 million have fled the north.\nThe survey found that 36 per cent of IDPs - 2.9 million people - are now in the relatively safer west of the country.\nThe IOM study found that financial support was the overwhelming need among IDPs, with shelter another pressing need.\n\"Nine per cent of all people surveyed in the latest report, including those not internally displaced, indicated that their homes were damaged or destroyed,\" the IOM said.\n\"Among the internally displaced alone, this figure rose to 27 per cent. Every one out of 10 people surveyed said that they would need materials to fix damaged homes.\"\nThe rapid representative assessment was conducted through interviews with 2,000 anonymous respondents aged over 18 who were contacted at random by telephone.\nThe survey is used by the IOM to gather insights into internal displacement and mobility and to assess the humanitarian needs in Ukraine.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/over-8-million-internally-displaced-in-ukraine-un"}
