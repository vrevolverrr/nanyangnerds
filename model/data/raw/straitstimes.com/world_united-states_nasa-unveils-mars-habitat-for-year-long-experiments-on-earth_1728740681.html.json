Such a distant mission comes with “very strict mass limitations”, she added.\nThe volunteers will live inside a 160 sq m home, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, which includes two bathrooms, a vertical farm to grow greens, a room dedicated to medical care, an area for relaxing and several work stations.\nAn airlock leads to an “outdoor” reconstruction of the Martian environment – though still located inside the hangar.\nSeveral pieces of equipment astronauts would likely use are scattered around the red sand-covered floor, including a weather station, a brick-making machine and a small greenhouse.\nThere is also a treadmill on which the astronauts will walk suspended from straps to simulate the red planet’s lesser gravity.\n“We really can’t have them just walking around in circles for six hours,” joked Professor Suzanne Bell, head of Nasa’s Behavioural Health and Performance Laboratory.\nFour volunteers will use the treadmill to simulate long trips outside to collect samples, gather data or build infrastructure, she said.\nThe members of the first experiment team have yet to be named, but the agency stated that selection “will follow standard Nasa criteria for astronaut candidate applicants”, with a heavy emphasis on backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nResearchers will regularly test the crew’s response to stressful situations, such as restricting water availability or equipment failures.\nThe habitat has another special feature: It was 3D-printed.\n“That is one of the technologies that Nasa is looking at as a potential to build habitat on other planetary or lunar surfaces,” Dr Douglas said.\nNasa is in the early stages of preparation for a mission to Mars, though most of the agency’s focus is on its upcoming Artemis missions, which aim to return humans to the Moon for the first time in half a century.
