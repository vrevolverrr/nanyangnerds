Countries were unable to advance on an issue that has eroded trust at climate talks for years.\nIn a letter to the roughly 200 nations that have signed up to the UN’s Paris Agreement – the world’s main climate pact – COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev lamented the absence of “necessary progress”.\n“We clearly need a rapid increase in the pace of our work,” wrote Mr Babayev, a government minister and former executive at Azerbaijan’s national oil company.\n“Time lost is lives, livelihoods and the planet lost,” he added.\n“We call on all parties to increase the pace of their work and move on from their early negotiating positions.”\n‘Supercharge’ efforts\nMr Babayev’s appeal comes in the hottest year on record and as extreme heatwaves, floods and wildfires batter communities around the globe.\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, whose own homeland of Grenada was devastated by hurricane Beryl earlier in July, urged countries to put the fight against global warming back on the political agenda.\n“Rather than just counting the costs of climate carnage, all governments must supercharge efforts to prevent them,” said Mr Stiell.\nHe was speaking during a visit to the island of Carriacou, where his grandmother’s house was among many destroyed.\n“Standing here, it’s impossible not to recognise the vital importance of delivering climate finance,” he added.\nWealthy nations have been under pressure to commit to new financing targets that go well beyond the US$100 billion (S$134 billion) a year they promised in 2009.\nDeveloping nations excluding China will need about US$2.4 trillion a year in climate investment by 2030, according to an expert assessment commissioned by the UN.\nThat is nearly 25 times more than the present levels.\nBut nations are nowhere near agreeing on a dollar aid figure, with talks bogged down over who should pay, what form the money should take and who should receive it.\nInformal talks\nUnder a 1992 climate accord, only a handful of the wealthiest industrialised nations at the time were obligated to pay climate finance.\nSome want the pool of contributors widened, most notably to include China, which is today vastly wealthier than 30 years ago, and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\nBut this has been a non-starter for developing nations, who have accused wealthy countries of trying to shirk their responsibility.\nTo break the ice, Azerbaijan will host the negotiating teams for an informal two-day retreat starting July 26.\nThey have named two experienced diplomats – Dan Jorgensen of Denmark and Yasmine Fouad of Egypt – to help the parties make headway.\nMr Babayev said the impasse would “not be solved by negotiators alone”, calling for political leadership on the sidelines to help move discussions toward consensus.
