Israel vets fuel shipments into Gaza and has long maintained that there is a risk they are diverted to Hamas.\n\"We need sustainable, meaningful, uninterrupted aid in the Gaza Strip if we want to reverse the hunger situation,\" Lazzarini said, adding that the operating environment is not conducive to doing so.\nIsrael, which launched its Gaza military operation after deadly Hamas attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, says it has expanded efforts to facilitate aid flows into Gaza and blames aid agencies for distribution problems inside the enclave.\nEstablished in 1949 following the first Arab-Israeli war, UNRWA provides services including schooling, primary healthcare and humanitarian aid in Gaza and the region.\nEarlier this year, 16 countries paused payments to the agency following Israel's claims that some UNRWA staff were linked to Palestinian armed groups.\nLazzarini said all but two of those countries, the United States and Britain, had since resumed financing after a review of the agency's neutrality showed Israel had yet to provide evidence for its accusations.\nIt now has enough funding to finance operations until the end of August, he added.
