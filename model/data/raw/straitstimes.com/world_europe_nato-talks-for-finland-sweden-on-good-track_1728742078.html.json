And therefore the German government is making all preparations for a very very rapid ratification process,\" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.\nMoscow's invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24 has swung political and public opinion in Finland and neighbouring Sweden in favour of Nato membership as a deterrent against Russian aggression.\nUnderlining the tense situation, Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto minister had stressed on Saturday that it was critical for as many Nato members as possible to \"announce clear support\" for Finland's security from when it files its application to its final accession.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/nato-talks-for-finland-sweden-on-good-track"}
