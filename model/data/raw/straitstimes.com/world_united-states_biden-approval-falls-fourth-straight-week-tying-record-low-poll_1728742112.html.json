Only 18 per cent of Americans think the country is headed in the right direction.\nMr Biden's approval rating is approaching - but has not yet reached - the lowest levels seen by his predecessor, Mr Donald Trump, who had a 33 per cent approval rating in December 2017.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States.\nThe most recent poll gathered responses from 1,002 adults, including 435 Democrats and 379 Republicans. It has a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of four percentage points.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/biden-approval-falls-fourth-straight-week-tying-record-low-poll"}
