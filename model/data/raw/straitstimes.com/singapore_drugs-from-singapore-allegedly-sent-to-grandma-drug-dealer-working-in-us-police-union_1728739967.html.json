This person has been really the grandma of the (union). It’s not the person that we’ve known for well over a decade.”\nSegovia was charged on March 27, and is alleged to have attempted to unlawfully import and distribute the synthetic drug valeryl fentanyl.\nThe US has been suffering from a fentanyl crisis since 2019, with thousands of deaths reported yearly. In 2022 alone, more than 71,000 Americans died from fentanyl-linked overdoses and drug poisonings, according to the US authorities.\nIn a statement on March 29, the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California said Segovia used her personal and office computers to order thousands of opioid and other pills to her home and agreed to distribute the drugs elsewhere in the US.\nShe was arrested as part of an investigation into a network that was shipping controlled substances into the San Francisco Bay Area from abroad.\nBetween October 2015 and January 2023, Segovia allegedly had at least 61 shipments declared as wedding party favours, gift make-up, chocolates and sweets mailed to her home.\nFive of these shipments were intercepted and opened by the authorities between July 2019 and January 2023, and they found thousands of pills of controlled substances, including the synthetic opioids tramadol and tapentadol.\nIt is alleged that Segovia used WhatsApp to plan the logistics of her drug deals, distributing the illicit substances out of the police union’s office and even using the union’s courier account to make the drug shipments.\nShe allegedly exchanged hundreds of messages with a number in India from January 2020 to March 2023, discussing details for shipping and payment for pills.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/drugs-from-singapore-allegedly-sent-to-grandma-drug-dealer-working-in-us-police-union"}
