Maybe we just focus on that.”\nThe investment fund 1MDB became the centre of a multi-billion-dollar scandal that spawned probes across continents.\nMonths after striking the initial agreement in 2020 – and staging an unusual and amusing photo op with Malaysian government officials to celebrate it – Goldman admitted to its role in the biggest foreign bribery case in US enforcement history.\nThe bank reached multiple international settlements exceeding US$5 billion for its part in raising funds for 1MDB.\nMalaysia is also pursuing efforts to bring back former Goldman banker Roger Ng, who has been sentenced in the US to 10 years in prison over his role in the scandal.\n“He was quite instrumental, he would know a lot and would be of immense assistance in our investigations,” Mr Anwar said.\nAs part of the 2020 settlement, Goldman made an initial US$2.5 billion payment while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4 billion of 1MDB assets seized by the authorities around the world, in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank.\nGoldman was also required to make an interim payment of US$250 million if Malaysia did not receive at least US$500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022, according to the bank. The two sides have been locked in a disagreement over that, the bank has spelled out in public filings.\nThe latest talks concern only the asset valuation dispute, a Goldman spokesman said.\nLawsuit and cheesecake\nWhile the two sides will try for an amicable resolution, Mr Anwar cautioned Goldman against assuming the lawsuit threat is a bluff.\n“They are taking us for granted, they think that we’ll not proceed” with a lawsuit, he said.\n“There is nothing for us to lose except for the legal fees, which a government can manage. But it is also the integrity of Goldman Sachs that is in question.”\nThe Malaysian government is unhappy on two key counts with the existing deal and how Goldman is approaching it.\n“The flaw is firstly the quantum and the interpretation of some of the clauses,” he said.\nMr Anwar said he could get personally involved, but he does not see the need for it. He added that Malaysia has a competent team to handle the matter, but if needed, he can “meet them for just casual tea or cheesecake”.
