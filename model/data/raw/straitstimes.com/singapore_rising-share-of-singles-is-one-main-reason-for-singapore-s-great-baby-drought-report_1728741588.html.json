The TFR refers to the average number of babies each woman would have during her reproductive years.\nIf more Singaporeans remain unwed, what this means is that Singapore’s TFR is likely to continue to fall, said the academics who study population issues.\nProfessor Jean Yeung, director of social sciences at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s Institute for Clinical Sciences and a professor at NUS’ Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said: “Since we will have an increasingly small number of women at a marriageable and child-bearing age, and births outside of wedlock are illegitimate in Singapore, the number of citizen births will likely continue to decline if the marriage rates keep declining.”\nThis is sobering news for Singapore, which has put in place an arsenal of measures to boost the birth rate in the past 20 over years. This includes Baby Bonus cash gifts for newborns, more maternity and paternity leave, and extending Government co-funding for in-vitro fertilisation treatment for older women.\nIn its analysis, the DOS compared the TFR for two different periods due to the difference in the data trends observed, its spokesperson told The Sunday Times.\nBetween 1990 and 2005, the decline in the fertility rate of married women contributed more to the drop in the TFR than the fall in the proportion of married women. The fertility rate of married women is also known as marital fertility.\nBut between 2005 and 2023, the drop in the TFR was due to the fall in the proportion of married women, which offset slight increases in marital fertility.\nIn particular, the DOS spokesperson said the fall in the TFR could be mainly attributed to the drop in the proportion of married women between the ages of 20 and 34.\nMarriage no longer seen as a life goal\nPopulation experts say that many Singaporeans feel that they do not have to marry, if they cannot find Mr or Miss Right, hence the increasing prevalence of singlehood.\nBesides, marriage is no longer seen as a required life goal in Singapore, said Dr Mathew Mathews, principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).\nDr Mathews said: “The stigma towards those who are unmarried has rapidly waned, which is a really good thing.\n“For quite a long time, the idea that a single person of marriageable age remaining unmarried was seen as undesirable.\n“These individuals were viewed with some level of pity, with others supposing their lives would not be fulfilled, or they had some characteristic which made them less desirable as marriage partners.”\nIPS senior research fellow Kalpana Vignehsa co-authored a study that found that women aged between 21 and 34 were significantly less interested in marriage and parenthood than men in their age group. The study polled about 2,400 Singapore residents in 2023.\nWhile the study did not ask respondents for their reasons behind their answers, Dr Vignehsa said the women she spoke to in her other research told her they are worried they have to shoulder the bulk of caregiving and other domestic responsibilities.\nShe said: “They talk about watching their mothers burn out from being primarily responsible for the visible and invisible labour of running a family on top of full-time employment, and they aren’t convinced that their male counterparts are ready to be equal partners at home.”\nIs raising the TFR a lost cause?\nThe DOS analysis noted that Singapore’s resident TFR has been on a “declining trend” for the past 30 years. In 1990, it was 1.83, and that fell to 1.26 in 2005.\nBut given the gravity of the matter, population experts say Singapore cannot afford to see the baby drought as a lost cause.\nAccording to the experts, the good news is surveys consistently show that many young Singaporeans still want to get married and have children.\nThe areas where Singapore can do more to tackle the issue include reducing the work-family life conflict, getting husbands to step up on the home front and mandating the additional two weeks of paid paternity leave, said those interviewed.\nWorking fathers of Singaporean children born on or after Jan 1, 2024, are now entitled to four weeks of government-paid paternity leave, up from two weeks. But for now, employers have the option to voluntarily grant the additional two weeks’ leave, which will be reimbursed by the Government.\nProf Yeung said: “If the leave needs an extra layer of approval from the employers, that deters fathers from asking for them, and fewer fathers will take them.\n“Research shows men will take paternity leave only when it is on a ‘take it or lose it’ basis. We need this change to have a significant impact on gender norms in Singapore.”\nBut beyond policies and schemes to promote marriage and parenthood, what is harder to achieve is to address the root causes of the beliefs that make having children seem so costly and daunting, the experts say.\nDr Tan Poh Lin, an IPS senior research fellow, said: “It requires directly addressing the root causes of why some parents feel so deeply stressed out, and how healthier views can replace the most unhealthy forms of parenting culture that cause parents to push themselves and their children too hard.”\nDr Vignehsa noted that many parents remain anxious about the cost of living, no matter how much Baby Bonus they have received, as it does not alleviate their financial anxiety in the long term.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/rising-share-of-singles-is-one-main-reason-for-singapore-s-great-baby-drought-report"}
