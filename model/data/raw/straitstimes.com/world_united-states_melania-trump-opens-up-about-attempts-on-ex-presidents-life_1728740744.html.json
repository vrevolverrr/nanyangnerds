And I watched it. I was only a few minutes behind... But when I saw it... nobody really knew yet because when you see him on the floor and you don’t know, you don’t know what really happened,” she said.\nTrump’s bid for a White House return was upended when Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at him from a nearby rooftop at the event in Pennsylvania before Crooks was shot dead by a sniper.\nTrump’s ear was grazed but he suffered no serious injury.\nMelania Trump praised her husband’s Secret Service detail - calling the agents “fantastic” despite criticism over the stunning security failure.\nShe also briefly recalled her reaction to the suspected second attempt on the 78-year-old Republican’s life at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida on Sept 15.\n“I think both of the events, they were really miracles. If you really think about it, July 13 was a miracle,” she said.\nThe reclusive, media-shy former first lady was giving her first television interview in two years to promote her memoir, out on Oct 8, less than a month before the election that could out her husband back in power.\nBut while politician’s spouses often take an active role in campaigning, Melania has largely snubbed her husband’s rallies.\nThe Slovenian former model, 54, was also absent from his court hearings in New York this spring, where he was convicted of 34 fraud felonies as part of a scandal involving hush money payments to a porn star.\nShe was asked about the various criminal cases Trump was facing, and she criticised an FBI search at the couple’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in 2022.\n“It made me angry, yes. Invasion of privacy. And the way it was done... I was really surprised,” she said, after the bureau entered the property to recover classified documents allegedly stored unlawfully.\n“You get angry because nobody should be putting up with that kind of stuff. Some person - I don’t know even know who or how many people, they went through my stuff,” she added.\nMelania Trump has published a series of videos on social media in recent days.\nIn one clip she questioned the first assassination attempt against her husband because she felt it was being brushed under the carpet by the media.\n“I had a lot of questions. What’s going on? This is not normal. And is it really shocking that all this outrageous violence goes against my husband?“ she said.\n“Especially (when) we hear the leaders from the opposition party and mainstream media branding him as a threat to democracy, calling him vile names... This needs to stop. The country needs to unite.”\nThe 256-page memoir is entitled simply “Melania”, and a signed version accompanied by photographs sells for US$250 (S$320).
