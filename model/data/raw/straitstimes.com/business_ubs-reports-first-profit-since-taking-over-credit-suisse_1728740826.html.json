It is aiming to achieve another US$1.5 billion in savings by the end of the year.\nThe first merger of two global systemically important banks – orchestrated by the Swiss authorities who feared that scandal-ridden Credit Suisse was on the brink of collapse – was completed in June 2023, after which UBS posted two consecutive quarters of losses due to the costs of absorbing its rival.\nDespite the shotgun nature of the takeover, investors have been upbeat about UBS’s prospects given the low acquisition costs and its huge increase in assets. Shares in the bank have climbed some 40 per cent over the past year.\n2024 is expected to be a pivotal year for UBS as it tackles some of the trickier stages of integration such as combining separate IT systems and legal entities, as well as migrating clients from Credit Suisse to UBS.\nWith the merger, UBS’s balance sheet has expanded to more than US$1.6 trillion, nearly twice the size of Switzerland’s economy and worrying regulators who fear huge consequences should the bank run into trouble.\nSwitzerland’s government recently laid out plans for how to police banks deemed “too big to fail” and tougher capital rules are expected sometime in the next few years.\nUBS said its current financials will allow it to execute on its 2024 capital return targets. This includes a plan to repurchase up to US$1 billion in shares in 2024 as well as increase 2023’s dividend of 70 US cents per share by a mid-teen percentage in 2024.
