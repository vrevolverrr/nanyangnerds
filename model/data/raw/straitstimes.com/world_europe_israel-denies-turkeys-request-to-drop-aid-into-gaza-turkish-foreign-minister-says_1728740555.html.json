Today we learnt that our request was rejected by Israel, despite a positive approach by the Jordanian authorities,” Mr Fidan said in a statement to the media.\nThe Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n“There is no excuse for Israel to block our attempt to drop aid to starving Gazans,” Mr Fidan said, adding that Turkey has decided to take a “series of new measures” against Israel.\n“These measures, approved by our President, will be implemented step by step, without delay,” Mr Fidan said, without elaborating.\n“The measures to be announced by our relevant institutions will continue until Israel declares a ceasefire and allows humanitarian aid to reach Gaza without interruption,” he said.
