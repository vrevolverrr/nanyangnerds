Some kind-hearted hawkers do return the change for amounts between $2 and $5. But others strictly accept the voucher amounts.\nPracticality and user benefits should be top priorities when designing the CDC payment deduction system.\nIf the CDC vouchers were distributed as two lump sums of $150 each and could be deducted according to the amounts actually spent, users would better enjoy the benefits instead of being restricted in using the vouchers or losing out on some precious cents – which can add up – because of the fixed denominations.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-fixed-denominations-restrict-use-of-cdc-vouchers-especially-for-budget-meals"}
