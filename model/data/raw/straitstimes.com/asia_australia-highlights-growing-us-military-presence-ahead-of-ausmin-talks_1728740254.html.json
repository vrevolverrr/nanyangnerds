Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defence Minister Richard Marles held meetings in Washington on Monday, a day before the AUSMIN talks.\nMarles highlighted the expanding role of a U.S. Marine rotational force in northern Australia and defence industry cooperation.\n\"We're seeing America's force posture in Australia grow really significantly, AUKUS is part of that, but it's not the only part of that,\" Marles said in talks with Austin, according to a statement.\nBIPARTISAN SUPPORT\nUnder the AUKUS programme, Washington will sell three nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the next decade, and with a U.S. election looming, Australia's Wong said in Washington there was bipartisan U.S. political support for the programme.\nU.S. Ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, told ABC Television that China and climate change - priorities for the Pacific Islands, where the U.S. and Australia are competing with China for security ties - would be discussed.\n\"Obviously with China being such an important ... trading partner and competitor for both of us, that is obviously one of the main topics,\" she said.\n\"We are also talking about what we can do together to fight climate change, (and) to help the Pacific Islands to build critical infrastructure to connect them,\" she added.\nAs part of co-operating on environmental and resource issues, Australia will spend A$200 million ($130 million) to upgrade ground station facilities in its remote central desert to process data from NASA's Landsat Next satellite.\nLandsat Next is an earth observation programme the U.S. space agency says will provide early warnings on the onset of fires or ice melting. The programme is scheduled to be launched in 2030.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the satellite data would also be used to target resource exploration in Australia, as the two nations develop a supply chain for critical minerals.\nThe U.S. and its allies are seeking to reduce China's market dominance in rare earths and critical minerals used in electric vehicles and defence technology.
