Analysts tell our correspondent Lim Min Zhang that Mr Lam is set to continue Vietnam’s “bamboo diplomacy” of being firm but flexible in its dealings with major powers.\nMeanwhile,Malaysia and India elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, following talks between their respective prime ministers Anwar Ibrahim and Narendra Modi in New Delhi.\nOver in Canberra, Australia and Indonesia unveiled a landmark defence pact during the visit of Indonesian Defence Minister and President-elect Prabowo Subianto.\nFurther afield, all eyes are on the trilateral partnership between the US, Japan and South Korea, not least because both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida are set to step down later this year. Still, analysts assure our correspondent Wendy Teo that the alliance will stay intact because the countries share deep interests beyond defence and security.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/asian-insider-vietnam-flexes-bamboo-diplomacy-in-china-church-conversions-trend-in-australia"}
