One of the sources said Mediterranean countries with strong shipping companies were concerned the measures could put them at a competitive disadvantage.\nIn the latest draft shipping companies now need only “report” such sales.\nOfficials from EU member states are meeting on Monday evening and are expected to further tweak the text but not substantially, the sources said, adding it could even be passed later on Monday.\n\"I think we have a more or less stable text,\" one of them said.\nThe European Commission declined to comment.\nArticle 12G, or the \"No Russia clause\", in the proposal has also been refined to a shorter list of dual-use goods, including weapons, as the majority of EU countries said the initial custom codes were too sweeping and would hurt their global trade.\nIn the proposed package, EU companies will have to make their counterparties sign contracts prohibiting re-export to Russia. The article will apply to pre-existing contracts with a transition phased, the sources said.\nThe latest working draft has also dropped the requirement for prior authorisation from member states for \"any transfer of funds\" by a Russian entity or Russian national residing in Russia out of the EU. Instead the banks and Russian entities or individuals will have to notify respective EU national regulators about transfers of at least 100,000 euros (S$144,595), who would then report them to the EU executive.\nThe biggest point of contention remains the exemption of sanctioned goods for personal use, with member states at odds on whether to exempt cars with Russian license plates entering the EU.\nMember states are also still negotiating transition times for import bans on some metal products, such as steel slabs and iron.\nThe most significant new measure is a direct ban on the import of non-industrial Russian diamonds from Jan. 1, which sources say has been agreed, as well as a phased indirect ban of Russian diamonds from other sources.\nThe latter will be done in concert with the Group of Seven countries that last week announced their own Russian diamond ban.
