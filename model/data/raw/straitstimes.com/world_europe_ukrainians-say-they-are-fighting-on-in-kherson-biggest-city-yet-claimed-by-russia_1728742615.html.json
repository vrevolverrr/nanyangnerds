And most ominously, a huge convoy of military vehicles stood north of Kyiv in apparent preparation for a major offensive.\nThe battle for control of Kherson, a shipbuilding centre of around 250,000 people, left bodies strewn about the city streets, blackouts, limited water and little food, Mr Kolykhaev said. Utility workers have tried to fix damaged pipes and downed lines, he said, but have come under fire from snipers.\nHe said a group of about 10 armed Russian officers, including the commander of forces attacking the city, had entered the city hall and informed him that they planned to set up a military administration.\nVideo and photographs verified by The New York Times appeared to show Russian troops having seized a government administrative building in Kherson, and at least three armoured vehicles lined up in front of the building with their guns facing outward. Two people confronted the vehicles while holding Ukrainian flags.\nMr Kolykhayev said late on Wednesday that Russian troops were in the streets. He called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos.\n“There were armed visitors in the city executive committee today,” he said in a statement. “I didn’t make any promises to them... I just asked them not to shoot people.”\nThe Russian invasion at first drew global attention to attacks on the two largest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv in the north, but it appeared to be making more progress in the south.\nCapturing Kherson could clear the way for Russian forces to push westward towards Odessa – a much bigger prize – as they try to seize Ukraine’s entire Black Sea coast, cutting it off from world shipping.\nAnother video showed Mr Semenikhin standing on a concrete planter outside the City Council building and addressing the crowd. He said the Russian soldiers had told him they would “raze the city to the ground with their artillery” if the residents did not surrender. He then asked the crowd whether they wanted to surrender or fight. The response was overwhelmingly in favour of fighting.\n“I am too,” Mr Semenikhin said. “But the decision has to be unanimous because their artillery is already trained on us.”\nEssentials cut\nRussian artillery and rocket fire have cut off essentials like electricity, medicine, water and heat to many Ukrainian communities and turned a growing number of offices, homes, businesses and vehicles to crumpled, burning hulks. Around the country, people are sheltering in basements and tunnels as explosions shake the ground above them. In Kyiv alone, some 15,000 people are sleeping in the subways.\n“These aren’t military targets,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. “They are places where civilians work and families live.”Ukraine is mounting stiffer resistance than either its allies or Russia had expected, a week into a war that has already left thousands of casualties and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. And the US and its allies, their stance against Moscow hardening with each passing day, are funneling an array of weapons into Ukraine, in addition to punishing Russia economically.\n“We’ve hardly slept for seven nights,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said early Wednesday in a video message. But, he added: “Today you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility.”\nA Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues. The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons – also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives – that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.\nThe high-calibre weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognisable, said Mr Kolykhaev, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.\n“Many of the bodies have been blown apart,” the mayor said. “If we can make a photograph it makes sense to try to identify them, but if not we put them into bags and bury them that way.”\nIn an emergency meeting on the crisis, the UN General Assembly voted 141-5 in favour of a resolution condemning Russia’s actions, with only Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Syria and Eritrea opposed. Thirty-five countries abstained, including China, India, Pakistan and Iran. Almost half of those abstaining were in Africa, where Russia has cultivated some strong relationships, and where the sparse supply of Covid-19 vaccines has fuelled existing tensions with the US and Europe.\nMeanwhile, Mr Blinken has announced “sweeping sanctions on Russia’s defence sector”, including the weapons manufacturers that make “the very systems now being used to assault Ukraine’s people”.\nThe US and its allies have cut off Russian access to much banking and international commerce, blocked imports and exports, and frozen Russian assets held abroad. Mr Biden also said Russian airlines would be banished from US airspace. The EU and the US both announced a fresh round of sanctions on Wednesday against Belarus, which Russia has used as a base for its drive on Kyiv.\nMr Putin on Wednesday banned anyone in Russia from taking more than US$10,000 (S$13,561) in foreign currency out of the country. He had built up an enormous reserve of foreign cash to weather such a crisis, but US officials say the sanctions are blocking access to much of it.\nAfter Russian stocks plummeted following the first rounds of sanctions, the government shut down the Moscow Stock Exchange on Monday, and it remained closed Tuesday and Wednesday. The rouble’s value has tumbled to record lows, despite efforts by Russia’s central bank to prop it up, and interest rates have more than doubled.\nIn Russian cities, thousands of people have been arrested for protesting the war, and imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny called for more people to take to the streets to oppose a conflict “unleashed by our obviously insane czar\".\nFollow The Straits Times' live coverage on the Ukraine crisis here.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/ukrainians-say-they-are-fighting-on-in-kherson-biggest-city-yet-claimed-by-russia"}
