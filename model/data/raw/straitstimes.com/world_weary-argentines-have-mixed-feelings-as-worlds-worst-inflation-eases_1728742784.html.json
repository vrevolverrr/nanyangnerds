Poverty levels have also risen.\n“I am tired, but this is something different to what we have seen before, that’s for sure,” said Mr Miguel Jamui, a 69-year-old retired worker, who is hopeful that the President’s maverick approach will start to yield results.\nMr Milei’s policies have helped bring down monthly inflation from more than 25 per cent in December to 4 per cent in July, though the country has slid into recession and subsidy cuts have pushed up prices of certain services and goods.\nMany Argentines still feel that their purchasing power is dwindling despite inflation slowing, with poverty affecting half the population and more than seven million children living in poverty, according to a study released this week by the United Nations Children’s Fund.\nMr Milei’s government argues that fiscal responsibility is essential to stabilise the economy and cautions that things will get tougher before improving.\nMs Maria Ruiz, a 43-year-old teacher, said she was still having to tighten her belt due to the economic crisis.\n“It’s incredible that every time you try to maintain a standard of living, you fall, you fall, you fall,” Ms Ruiz said near the iconic Obelisco monument in central Buenos Aires, where shop windows were full of promotions to attract customers.\n“I see that merchants are trying to survive with promotions or whatever they can, but the truth is, it’s not enough.” REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/weary-argentines-have-mixed-feelings-as-worlds-worst-inflation-eases"}
