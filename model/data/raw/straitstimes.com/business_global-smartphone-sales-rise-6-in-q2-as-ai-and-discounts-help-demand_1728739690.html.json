IDC said Apple shipped 45.2 million handsets in the quarter, a 1.5 per cent improvement on the same period a year earlier.\nCounterpoint’s figures, which address end-user sales, showed a 1 per cent decline, and both research groups found the iPhone giving up market share.\nXiaomi was the biggest riser, largely powered by entry-level handsets and emerging markets.\nThe iPhone has been under pressure in China from local players and a government ban on foreign devices at state-run workplaces.\nDiscounts and the promise of new artificial intelligence (AI) enhancements have helped steady sales for Apple and market leader Samsung Electronics, which is also promoting a new generation of phones with AI additions.\n“Apple’s momentum in the second quarter improved significantly from the negative growth they saw in the first quarter,” said IDC research director Nabila Popal.\n“This is in part due to heavy discounts and promotions in many regions, but also thanks to renewed customer confidence after WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) when Apple finally announced its AI strategy.” REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/global-smartphone-sales-rise-6-in-q2-as-ai-and-discounts-help-demand"}
