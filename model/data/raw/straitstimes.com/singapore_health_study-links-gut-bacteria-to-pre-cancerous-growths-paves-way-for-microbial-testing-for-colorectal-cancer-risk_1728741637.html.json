Now, if you could manipulate what you eat plus your innate microbes, you can get a better outcome,” he said.\nThe study was published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe in May 2023.\nDr Lee started working on the study with other researchers during his fellowship at the Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard. He is now a visiting scientist there.\nHe spoke to The Straits Times ahead of a free talk on the study findings and common gut problems at the Fighting Cancer, Living Stronger event on Jan 27, organised by the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore.\nColorectal cancer, which starts in the colon or the rectum, is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Singapore, after lung cancer in men and breast cancer in women.\nIt can arise from two main types of pre-cancerous polyps – adenomatous or serrated polyps. Current screening methods, particularly colonoscopy, are highly effective for picking up adenomatous polyps, which are the most common. Serrated polyps tend to be missed more often during colonoscopy.\nColonoscopy is the current gold standard for screening for colorectal cancer. During the process, a polyp can be detected and removed before it becomes cancerous.\nFor the study, the researchers studied the data from 971 healthy patients undergoing routine colonoscopy at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the United States. Researchers looked at the information on patients’ health, diet, medication history and lifestyles, and analysed their stool specimens to determine their bacterial make-up.\nThe researchers then identified 19 bacterial species associated with adenomatous polyps and eight in serrated polyps.\nThey also found that diet and medication significantly shaped the gut microbiome associated with common pre-cancerous colorectal polyps.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/study-links-gut-bacteria-to-pre-cancerous-growths-paves-way-for-microbial-testing-for-colorectal-cancer-risk"}
