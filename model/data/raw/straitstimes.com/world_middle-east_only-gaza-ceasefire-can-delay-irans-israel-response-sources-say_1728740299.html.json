Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.\nThe US Navy has deployed warships and a submarine to the Middle East to bolster Israeli defences.\nOne of the sources, a senior Iranian security official, said Iran, along with allies such as Hezbollah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks fail or it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. The sources did not say how long Iran would allow for talks to progress before responding.\nWith an increased risk of a broader Middle East war after the killings of Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Iran has been involved in intense dialogue with Western countries and the United States in recent days on ways to calibrate retaliation, said the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nIn comments published on Aug 13, the US ambassador to Turkey confirmed Washington was asking allies to help convince Iran to de-escalate tensions.\nThree regional government sources described conversations with Tehran to avoid escalation ahead of the Gaza ceasefire talks, due to begin on Aug 15 in either Egypt or Qatar.\n“We hope our response will be timed and executed in a way that does not harm a potential ceasefire,” Iran’s mission to the United Nations said on Aug 9 in a statement.\nIran’s Foreign Ministry on Aug 13 said calls to exercise restraint “contradict principles of international law”.\n“Something could happen as soon as this week by Iran and its proxies... That is a US assessment, as well as an Israel assessment,” White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Aug 12.\n“If something does happen this week, the timing of it could certainly well have an impact on these talks we want to do on (Aug 15),” he added.\nAt the weekend, Hamas cast doubt on whether talks would go ahead.\nIsrael and Hamas have held several rounds of talks in recent months without agreeing on a final ceasefire.\nIn Israel, many observers believe a response is imminent after Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said it would “harshly punish” Israel for the strike in Tehran.\nIran’s regional policy is set by the elite Revolutionary Guards, who answer only to Ayatollah Khamenei, the country’s top authority.\nIran’s relatively moderate new President, Mr Masoud Pezeshkian, has repeatedly reaffirmed Iran’s anti-Israel stance and its support for resistance movements across the region since taking office in July.\nMr Meir Litvak, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Alliance Centre for Iranian Studies, said he thought Iran would put its needs before helping its ally Hamas, but that Iran also wanted to avoid a full-scale war.\n“The Iranians never subordinated their strategy and policies to the needs of their proxies or proteges,” Mr Litvak said. “An attack is likely and almost inevitable, but I don’t know the scale and the timing.”\nIran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz said the Islamic republic’s leaders were now keen to work towards a ceasefire in Gaza, “to obtain incentives, avoid an all-out war and strengthen its position in the region”.\nMr Laylaz said Iran had not previously been involved in the Gaza peace process but was now ready to play “a key role”.\nIran, two of the sources said, was considering sending a representative to the ceasefire talks, in what would be a first since the war started in Gaza.\nThe representative would not directly attend the meetings but would engage in behind-the-scenes discussions “to maintain a line of diplomatic communication” with the US while negotiations proceed.\nTwo senior sources close to Lebanon’s Hezbollah said Tehran would give the negotiations a chance but would not give up its intentions to retaliate.\nA ceasefire in Gaza would give Iran cover for a smaller “symbolic” response, one of the sources said.\nIran has not publicly indicated what would be the target of an eventual response to the Haniyeh assassination.\nOn April 13, two weeks after two Iranian generals were killed in a strike on Tehran’s Embassy in Syria, Iran unleashed a barrage of hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles towards Israel, damaging two airbases. Almost all of the weapons were shot down before they reached their targets.\n“Iran wants its response to be much more effective than the April 13 attack,” said Mr Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
