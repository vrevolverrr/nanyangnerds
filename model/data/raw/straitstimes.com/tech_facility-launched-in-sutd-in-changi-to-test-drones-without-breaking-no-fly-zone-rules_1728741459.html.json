The site is equipped with 5G systems that testers can tap for their projects.\nThey can use bigger drones here as the space is larger than most indoor test sites available, said Prof Foong, adding that they can quickly pack up and seek shelter in the school when it starts to rain.\nThe site will be opened to other schools and drone hobbyists at a later stage, said Prof Foong, who works in SUTD’s engineering product development department.\nSpeaking at the launch of the Aerial Arena, Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng said the netted outdoor facility helps to overcome the constraints of Singapore’s limited airspace.\nDr Tan, who is also Second Minister for Trade and Industry, said: “While SUTD is located in a ‘no-fly zone’ due to its proximity to Changi Airport, the Aerial Arena at SUTD will be able to support the flight-testing of drones and open-air testing of other technologies that require three-dimensional space.”\nSpeaking at the National Robotics Programme’s sixth-anniversary event at SUTD, he noted that robotics is an important industry here as it boosts productivity, safety and quality in the workplace.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/facility-launched-in-sutd-in-changi-to-test-drones-without-breaking-no-fly-zone-rules"}
