Border areas, especially near Myanmar, have endured almost constant lockdowns and seen an exodus of businesses.\nLocked-down communities have complained of poor access to food, supplies and medical treatment.\nMeanwhile, migrant workers have been left stranded from families for months due to onerous travel rules and restrictions.\nStrict enforcement has sometimes sparked outrage, such as when health workers beat a corgi to death after the owners were sent to quarantine.\nAnalysts say repeated shutdowns of factories and businesses have contributed to the country's slowdown, despite China being the only major economy to expand in 2020.\nWill China ever reopen?\nA: \"China certainly has shown it is feasible to continue the zero-Covid-19 strategy almost indefinitely,\" Professor Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University, told Agence France-Presse.\nThe country effectively cut itself off from the world in March 2020 and virtually banned foreigners from entering.\nSince then, travel restrictions have eased slightly.\nBut international tourism is non-existent and the government has said it will not renew expiring Chinese passports unless the holder has a good reason for travel.\nThe country will not reopen until at least after the upcoming Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Beijing, with the government anxiously guarding the capital and tightening restrictions ahead of the Games.\nThose who question \"zero Covid-19\" have faced a nationalistic backlash.\nProminent Chinese medical expert Zhang Wenhong wrote in July that countries must eventually \"learn to co-exist with the virus\" - prompting attacks from online trolls.\nWhat will happen if China opens up?\nA: Peking University researchers have warned that China could suffer a \"colossal outbreak\" that would overwhelm its medical system if it relaxed restrictions to a similar level as Europe and the US.\nBut Professor Ivan Hung, an infectious diseases expert at Hong Kong University, said second-generation vaccines targeting the Delta and Omicron variants - as well as close to 100 per cent vaccination rates - could ward off a disaster.\nIn this scenario, \"it's likely that Covid will turn out to be similar to influenza\", Prof Hung said.\nBut letting the virus in could be risky for President Xi Jinping as he seeks a third term in October after billing himself as a leader that will always keep China safe.\n\"When it does come, the transition may not be easy because Chinese society has gotten quite used to a low level of transmission,\" said University of Oxford's Thomas Hale.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/how-china-is-keeping-to-its-strict-zero-covid-19-approach"}
