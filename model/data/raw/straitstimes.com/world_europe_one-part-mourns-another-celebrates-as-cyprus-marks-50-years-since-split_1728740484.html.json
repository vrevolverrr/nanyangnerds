Turkish Cypriots want a two-state settlement.\n\"We have one aim: A Republic of Cyprus with a single sovereignty, a single international personality, a single nationality, in a bizonal, bicommunal federation, a single state where all citizens will be Cypriots and Europeans, without a foreign occupation army, without outdated guarantees,\" Mitsotakis told a sombre event in the southern parts of Nicosia in remembrance of 1974.\nGreece and Turkey recently agreed to discuss how to improve relations, but \"the fact that we have been discussing, doesn't mean that we agree and, more importantly, that we back down,\" Mitsotakis said.\nREMEMBERING THE DEAD\nCyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and led to the dispatch of a U.N. peacekeeping force.\nThe crisis left Greek Cypriots running the internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus, a member of the European Union since 2004 with the potential to derail Turkey's own decades-long aspirations of joining the bloc.\nIt also complicates any attempts to unlock energy potential in the eastern Mediterranean because of overlapping claims. The region has seen major discoveries of hydrocarbons in recent years.\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides, whose office represents the Greek Cypriot community in the reunification dialogue, said the anniversary was a sombre occasion for reflection and for remembering the dead.\n\"The condemnable and unacceptable events we see happening in Ukraine today ... were perpetrated 50 years ago in Cyprus and we are living its consequences every day,\" he said.\nAcross the south, church services were held to remember the more than 3,000 people who died in the Turkish invasion.\n\"It was a betrayal of Cyprus and so many kids were lost. It wasn't just my son, it was many,\" said Loukas Alexandrou, 90, as he tended the grave of his son at a military cemetery.\nIn Turkey, blanket state television coverage focused on violence against Turkish Cypriots prior to the invasion, particularly on bloodshed in 1963-64 and in 1967.\nTurkey's invasion took more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south.\nReunification talks collapsed in 2017 and have been at a stalemate since. Northern Cyprus is a breakaway state recognised only by Turkey, and its Turkish Cypriot leadership wants international recognition.
