But I think diplomacy is crucial,” Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Reuters ahead of the three-day gathering that he will chair. “Our international position is very clear... We are united. This is crucial.”\nBut having a unified position has not been enough to bring peace to either Ukraine or the Middle East.\nThe Israelis have resisted repeated calls to halt their Gaza offensive, while in Ukraine the momentum on the battlefield has shifted in Russia’s favour, with the West seemingly incapable of providing Kyiv with the weaponry it desperately needs.\nMr Tajani said it was crucial for Ukraine to keep the Russians at bay, adding that both Nato head Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba would be in Capri to discuss the conflict.\n“If there is a defeat of Ukraine, it’s impossible to achieve an agreement. Defeat is not a good bridge for peace. For this we need to back Ukraine. But the final goal is peace. Peace with justice. Justice, Russia, outside Ukraine,” Mr Tajani said, speaking in English.\nRussian money\nHighlighting that the West alone could not bring sufficient pressure on Russia to end the war, Mr Tajani said it was essential to involve China. “If you want to achieve peace, we need also Chinese engagement. The Chinese are friends of Russia,” he said.\nAs Ukraine finances buckle under the weight of the war, the US has proposed that the G-7 look at ways of utilising some US$300 billion (S$410 billion) of sovereign Russian assets held in the West to help Kyiv.\nDiplomatic sources say the US, Canada and Britain want the assets to be seized, but that European Union nations are reluctant to do so because it would set a dangerous legal precedent.\n“At the political level we are not against (this). But I think we need to study if it’s possible,” said Tajani. “Without a legal basis, it would be a mistake to move on.”\nA final decision is expected to be taken by the full G-7 leaders’ summit in the southern region of Puglia in June.\nThe opening session of the meeting on the evening of April 17 will focus on Gaza and Iran, with the situation in the Red Sea under discussion on the morning of April 18. Before turning to Ukraine, the ministers will look at ways of reinforcing ties with Africa.\nRome has made Africa a priority for its year at the helm of the G-7 presidency, saying developing economic well-being across the continent is vital to prevent mass migration towards Europe in the years ahead.\n“It’s a big mistake to look at Africa (through) European glasses. We need to look at Africa with African glasses. We need to work together. They are friends. They are not under us,” said Mr Tajani.\nThe final session on the morning of April 19 is earmarked for talks on Asia.\n“We are for the status quo in China, in Taipei (Taiwan). We want peace,” said the Italian minister. REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/wars-to-dominate-g7-talks-as-foreign-ministers-seek-path-to-peace"}
