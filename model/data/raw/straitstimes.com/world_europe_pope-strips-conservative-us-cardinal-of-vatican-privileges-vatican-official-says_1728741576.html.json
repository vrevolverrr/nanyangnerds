His is a consultant to one of its tribunals, as are numerous cardinals who live outside Rome, and spends most of his time in his native state of Wisconsin.\nThe official who was at the meeting denied media reports that Francis had called the 75-year-old Burke \"an enemy\".\nBurke is a hero to traditionalists in the Church, particularly in the United States, where he is often a guest on conservative Catholic media outlets that have made criticism of the pope a mainstay of their operations.\nThe move by Francis was his second involving a conservative American prelate this month.\nOn Nov. 11, the pope dismissed another conservative critic, Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, after Strickland refused to step down following a Vatican investigation.\nWhile conservatives are a minority in the Church, they have significant clout in advanced countries such as the United States, in part because of their link to conservative politics.\nBurke has been opposing the pope's reforms almost from the start.\nIn 2014, a year after Francis was chosen, the pope removed Burke as head of a Vatican tribunal and moved him to a largely ceremonial post several days after Burke said the Church under Francis was \"like a ship without a rudder\".\nMost recently, in October, Burke was one of five cardinals who openly challenged a global month-long Vatican meeting, known as a synod.\nBefore the meeting began, Burke was the star quest of a gathering of conservative in a theatre just a few blocks from the Vatican.\nThere, he called for a defence against the \"the poison of confusion, error and division\" in the Church.\nA person close to Burke said the cardinal had not yet been formerly informed of the pope's decision, which was first reported by the conservative Italian outlet, La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana.
