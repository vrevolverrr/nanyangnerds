The truck then left the hospital.\n“They must act according to the international humanitarian law and in a way that preserves the dignity of the martyrs and their families,” Mr Ismail Al-Thawabta told Reuters.\nThe Red Cross said it was not involved in the transfer process.\n“We reiterate that all families have the right to receive news about their loved ones and bury them respectfully and in line with their traditions,” said a statement issued by the ICRC.\nUnder International Humanitarian Law, those who have died during an armed conflict must be handled with dignity and be properly managed.\nThe law requires that they be searched for, collected and evacuated, which helps ensure that people do not go missing, the ICRC statement added.\nThe Civil Emergency Service tasked with finding people missing under rubble, on roads and in ruined buildings in Gaza says it has been notified of around 10,000 people missing during the near year-long Israeli assault on Gaza.\nGaza health authorities list more than 41,000 people confirmed killed in the assault, which Israel launched after Hamas fighters attacked Israeli towns on Oct 7, during which 1,200 people died and around 250 were taken as hostages.\nIn recent days the conflict has spread to another major theatre, with Israel launching the biggest air strikes on Lebanon in nearly two decades, targeting the Hezbollah movement, which has been rocketing Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians.\nMore strikes in Gaza\nWar in Gaza has not let up, even as the conflict in Lebanon has escalated.\nMany months of diplomatic efforts to reach a Gaza ceasefire have yielded little progress, with Israel refusing any deal to halt the fighting without the total defeat of Hamas.\nIsraeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 14 people on Sept 25, medics said.\nIn Rafah, near the border with Egypt, Israeli forces continued their operations in different areas of the city, amid clashes with Hamas-led fighters, according to residents and statements posted by militants.\nMedics said at least eight people were killed in two separate Israeli strikes on two houses in Rafah. One of those strikes killed a woman and her children, they added.\nIn another attack in Bureij, one of the Gaza Strip’s eight historic refugee camps, five people were killed in a house hit by an Israeli missile, medics said.\nIsrael has also sent tanks into the eastern area of Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, and medics said a woman was killed in an air strike on a house in the town earlier on Sept 24.
