Prices at Kopar at Newton have also increased from $2,384 psf to $2,433 psf over the same period.\nSimilar price increases were observed at other projects such as Treasure at Tampines, Jadescape and Forett at Bukit Timah, Ms Sun added.\nColliers International head of research for Singapore Tricia Song said developers sold 2,381 new private homes, excluding executive condos, in the last three months of 2020, down by 32.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter and a marginal 2.5 per cent decline year-on-year.\nThis should bring full year new sales to 9,760 units, down 1.5 per cent from 9,912 units in 2019, she said.\nSales in the secondary market was more resilient in the fourth quarter of 2020, falling just 5.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter but up 36.9 per cent year-on-year. This brings full year secondary sales to 9,905 units, up 7.2 per cent from 9,238 units in 2019, said Ms Song.\nHuttons Asia head of research Lee Sze Teck said up to 20 new launches can be expected in the first quarter of this year, with some 9,000 new units and a price increase up to 3 per cent this year.\n\"Selling prices are expected to edge up because of recent firm land tender prices and higher construction costs because of Covid-19 safety management measures,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/spore-private-home-prices-rise-21-in-q4-fastest-pace-since-cooling-measures-ura"}
