Today, there is more emphasis on understanding someone else's point of view.\nEspecially when the environment has changed tremendously, he added, with young trainees joining law enforcement agencies.\n\"The environment has changed, both from the training viewpoint, and also with the demographics, the age and the understanding of the people coming into this business,\" Mr Kerlikowske said.\n\"How can you make sure there is collaboration between instructors that are older and the generation of students that are essentially younger?\"\nHe said both groups should listen to each other and spend more time on the ground forging relationships with people other than their peers.\nHe added that younger officers need to tap the street smarts of their older instructors, and the latter must adapt to technology and not be afraid of it.\nTo Mr Kerlikowske, a former police chief of Seattle, trust is a two-way street.\nOfficers are encouraged to walk the ground and have face-to-face interaction with the public.\nIn Singapore, initiatives such as SGSecure, Citizens on Patrol and Road Safety Champions empower communities and bridge the gap between the police and citizens.\nMr Kerlikowske said whether in the US or in Singapore, there will be challenges faced by law enforcement agencies.\nHe said: \"We are seeing older residents who may not be tech-savvy. The organisation can be high-tech but still requires interaction with residents.\n\"How do you synthesise the level of knowledge and information needed to communicate, especially at times with older populations that are not as tech-savvy?\"\nAnd sometimes, the bonds the police have with the community occasionally get tested.\nIn Singapore, two cases involving the police could have cast major doubts on police officers.\nOn Aug 3 last year, former Workers' Party MP Raeesah Khan lied that she had accompanied a sexual assault victim to a police station where officers allegedly handled the matter insensitively and drove the victim to tears.\nOn Nov 1, she apologised in Parliament to the Singapore Police Force and retracted an anecdote she had shared of the alleged incident. She then resigned from Parliament on Nov 30.\nThe second incident involved Ms Parti Liyani, a domestic helper acquitted on Sept 4, 2020, of stealing more than $30,000 worth of items from her employer in March 2019.\nTwo police officers - an investigation officer in the case and his supervisor - were fined for neglecting their duties, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam last month in Parliament.\nSaid Mr Kerlikowske: \"Whether officers are involved in something wrong, or whether someone else is the example, it is important for the police department to be open, honest and transparent about it.\"", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/in-a-changing-world-trust-and-transparency-more-vital-now-for-law-enforcement-agencies-top-former-us-cop"}
