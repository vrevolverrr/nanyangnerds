She added that the groomer agreed to her request to send over photos of Emma periodically during the session.\nMs Tan, who works at a digital payments company, also asked the groomer to send Emma back to her home via a private-hire vehicle after the session, and for someone to accompany her on the journey.\nAt about 7.30pm, the groomer sent Ms Tan a WhatsApp message saying Emma was ready to be sent back home, and Ms Tan paid Awesome Pawsome $160.\nBut about 30 minutes later, she received another message saying the groomer had lost Emma.\n“Janet, your dog slipped the leash and escaped while we were loading up the car,” read the message, which was seen by ST.\nAnother message read: “Janet, why is your body harness so loose, it’s not even secured.”\nIn a panic, Ms Tan enlisted her neighbours’ help through a text message group chat to search for Emma, after the groomer informed her of the dog’s last known location.\n“Instead of taking a car down to the spot, I went there on foot, in case Emma was following the route back to my place,” she said.\nAn hour later, Emma was found by Ms Tan’s colleague, whom she was hosting to dinner that night.\nBut just then, the dog dashed onto the road and was hit by a car.\nMotionless and bloody, Emma was rushed to Beecroft Bird & Exotics Veterinary Clinic in Alexandra Road, where vets administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 10 minutes. She was pronounced dead after that.\n“I sent Emma to the groomer expecting her to come home looking better... Little did I know that she would only come home in an urn,” said a bereft Ms Tan.\nMs Tan said she and her husband had decided to get Emma as a 20th anniversary gift to themselves, adding that she considers the dog to be her second child, after her 17-year-old son.\n“I keep blaming myself. Why did I send her there? I keep asking myself, what if I had picked her up myself instead?” she said.\nHer husband, Mr Raymond Khoo, a 60-year-old restaurateur, took to Facebook to express his grief and anger over Emma’s passing and how the groomer had handled the situation.\n“The whole family is devastated,” he wrote. “Emma sleeps with me nightly; the bed feels empty, including the big void in my heart.”\nThe couple later took a closer look at Awesome Pawsome’s Google reviews and said they seemed to be bogus because they did not come with images, and its reviewers often did not rate other businesses.\nThe family later decided to lodge complaints about the incident with the NParks’ Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) and the police, in a bid to get answers about how something like this could have happened.\nThe police confirmed that a report was lodged.\nThe groomer declined to comment when contacted by ST.\nIt gave the family a refund, but Ms Tan said she sent the money back, as she was offended by an “insensitive” note that accompanied it, and also because she felt no amount could make up for losing Emma.\nAVS’ group director for industry standards and regulation, Ms Jessica Kwok, said in response to queries from ST that it was investigating the case.\nShe added that NParks would investigate and take action against operators “for cases with evidence to suggest that a pet had suffered injuries or death” due to their negligence.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nparks-probing-home-based-pet-groomer-who-lost-client-s-dog-that-later-died-in-traffic-accident"}
