Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says only the island’s people can decide their future.\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said after a bilateral meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken:“The impact the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait has on our country is a given, but it is a crucial factor in the wider safety and security of the international community as well.”\nMr Hayashi also told reporters that French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said France has “deep feelings” about respecting the status quo and maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\nJapan said the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong had conducted air operations with jet fighters and helicopters between April 10 to 16. China’s state media said its navy carried out combat training around Taiwan last week.\nRussia too has also been keen to show force in the Pacific, and recently launched naval exercises by its Pacific Fleet, drawing criticism from Tokyo.\nChina is increasingly trying to replace international rules with “its own rules”, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Monday, on the sidelines of the G-7 meeting.\n“Many of our partners in the region feel more and more that China increasingly wants to exchange the existing common binding international rules with its own rules,” said Ms Baerbock, who last week met her Chinese counterpart in Beijing last week.\nThe G-7 comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\nChina’s top diplomat Wang Yi “hopes and believes” Germany will support China’s “peaceful reunification” with Taiwan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
