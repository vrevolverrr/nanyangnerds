That means other Asian countries must compete with China for demand that’s not growing.\n“With no clear driver of global growth, it’s hard to paint a rosy outlook for Asia.”\nJapan’s final au Jibun Bank PMI stood at 48.2 in March, the highest level since November and recovering from February’s 47.2, which marked the fastest pace of contraction in over 3½ years.\nBut activity contracted for a 10th straight month as new export orders slumped, reflecting souring sentiment in key markets like China and North America, the survey showed.\nSouth Korea’s manufacturing activity also weakened in March as slowing domestic demand offset robust overseas sales, with the PMI falling to 49.8 in March from 50.7 in February.\nVietnam’s PMI dropped to 49.9 in March from 50.4 in February, and Malaysia’s declined to 48.4 from 49.5, the surveys showed. Taiwan’s PMI also contracted in March, coming in at 49.3, although this was an improvement from 48.6 in February. By contrast, manufacturing activity expanded in March in the Philippines and Indonesia, the surveys showed.\nIn revised forecasts issued in January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected Asia’s economy to expand 4.5 per cent in 2024, driven by robust US demand and the boost from expected stimulus measures in China. But it said the recovery would be divergent across economies, with Japan likely to see growth slow to 0.9 per cent, in contrast to an expected 6.5 per cent expansion in India.\nThe IMF expects China’s economy to expand 4.6 per cent in 2024, slowing from 5.2 per cent in 2023.
