Much of their military equipment is inter-operable with Nato allies.\nMoscow describes its actions as a \"special military operation\" to disarm Ukraine and rid it of anti-Russian nationalism fomented by the West. Ukraine and its allies say Russia launched an unprovoked war.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/finland-turkey-to-hold-talks-as-nato-ministers-gather"}
