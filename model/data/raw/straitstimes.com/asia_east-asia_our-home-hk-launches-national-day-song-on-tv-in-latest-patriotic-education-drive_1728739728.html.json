No matter how far or how tough the journey, we are never afraid,” goes the refrain sung by Kwong, 62, a former beauty queen and popular Cantopop singer from the 1980s and 1990s.\nKwong – also known as Kuang Meiyun – performed the song alongside a student choir at the West Kowloon Cultural District on the eve of China’s national day on Sept 30.\nKaraoke versions of the song, first released in September, will be distributed to primary and secondary school students across Hong Kong in October, the working group said.\nOur Home appears to be Hong Kong’s first pop song written specifically for national education purposes.\nThere have been other pop songs related to the same theme, such as late singer Roman Tam’s Chinese Dreams in the 1980s, but they were not produced specifically for any campaign, according to the University of Hong Kong’s Professor Stephen Chu.\n“The use of a pop song (for Our Home) seems aimed at attracting wider public attention, especially that of the younger generation,” Prof Chu, who teaches Hong Kong culture, film and music, told The Straits Times.\nBut while the song is easy on the ears and has references to the Lion Rock Spirit in the lyrics and visuals, “the ‘top-down’ approach is not usually very effective”, he said.\n“Society has changed so much that I’m not sure if the style and the spirit still appeal to the general public, let alone the younger generation.”\nHowever, it will be a long-term effort to nurture a sense of belonging to the motherland among Hong Kong people, many of whom still find the compulsory singing of the national anthem at local schools a foreign concept.\nIt became mandatory in 2022 for all public schools in Hong Kong to hold a flag-raising ceremony with the singing of the national anthem once a week. But the move – while implemented – was met with contention, with the media reporting at that time that many residents viewed it as a form of indoctrination.\nProfessor Anthony Cheung, a former official who is now a research chair professor of public administration at the Education University of Hong Kong, said while national education is “normal and necessary in any country”, the notion has for decades been marked by ambiguity in Hong Kong due to its “unique historical legacy”.\nHong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997 under the “one country, two systems” framework that promises the city a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not typically enjoyed elsewhere in China.\n“As we move into the future, patriotism and national education should be normalised...\n“One should not need to feel either that patriotism is something negative and uncalled for by default, nor should one feel constantly under pressure to prove that we are patriotic all the time,” Prof Cheung told ST.\n“We should do away with this kind of baggage. We can be proud of our country and also be critical of it when we have not done things well enough.”", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/our-home-hk-launches-national-day-song-on-tv-in-latest-patriotic-education-drive"}
