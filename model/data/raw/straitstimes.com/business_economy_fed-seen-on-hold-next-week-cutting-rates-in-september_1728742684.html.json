With inflation edging closer to that goal but still above it, they are seen keeping the policy rate in the 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent next week.\n“From the Fed’s perspective, cumulatively, we think the data show enough progress - on both inflation and labor market conditions - for policymakers to open the door to a rate cut in September at next week’s FOMC meeting,” wrote High Frequency Economics’ chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi.\nAfter the data, traders of futures tied to the Fed policy rate added slightly to bets the Fed will deliver three rate cuts by year end.\nCore PCE prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices and which the Fed uses as a gauge of where inflation is headed, accelerated 0.2 per cent in June from May, the report showed, a bit more than the 0.1 per cent economists polled by Reuters had projected.
