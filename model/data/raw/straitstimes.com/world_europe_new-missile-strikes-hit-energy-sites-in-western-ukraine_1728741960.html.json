Parks, tourist sites and busy rush-hour streets were also hit.\nKyiv and its allies condemned Monday’s attacks.\nUnited States President Joe Biden and other G-7 leaders convened on Tuesday to discuss what more they could do to support Ukraine.\nMr Zelensky told them air defence systems are his “No. 1 priority”.\nMr Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said on Tuesday that Mr Biden’s promises to supply advanced air defence systems to Ukraine will only extend the conflict and inflict more pain for Ukraine.\nHe added that the deliveries would not change Moscow’s goals in its military operation in Ukraine.\nTuesday’s missile strikes did not seem as intense as on Monday.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the main targets on Tuesday were energy facilities.\n“They’ve hit many yesterday, and they hit the same and new ones today. These are war crimes planned well in advance and aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians – Russia’s deliberate strategy since months,” he wrote on Twitter.\nThe governor of the southern town of Mykolayiv said Russia seemed to have changed tactics.\n“They launch rockets more than once, so that our people can wait and our air defence can work. But, at intervals, they launch significantly fewer rockets and keep people in shelters. What is this if not terror?” he said on national television.\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine’s sixth-largest city, apartment blocks have been struck overnight at least three times in the past week, killing civilians while they slept.\nIn an overnight video address from the scene of one of the attacks in Kyiv, Mr Zelensky promised that Ukraine would keep fighting.\n“We will do everything to strengthen our armed forces. We will make the battlefield more painful for the enemy,” he said. REUTERS, NYTIMES", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/new-missile-strikes-hit-energy-sites-in-western-ukraine"}
