They then alerted Singapore Customs.\nThe next day, Customs officers launched an operation at a store unit in an industrial building in Jalan Pemimpin. They saw three men entering the unit after four steel water tanks were unloaded from the container and moved into the unit.\nThe officers raided the unit and found duty-unpaid cigarettes concealed in the water tanks. Small quantities of duty-unpaid cigarettes and e-vaporiser pods were also found in a car belonging to one of the men. The car was parked outside the building.\nA fourth man was arrested after a probe revealed that he was involved in the importation of the duty-unpaid cigarettes. The four men are aged between 24 and 48.\nOne man has been charged in court and ordered to be remanded until Friday for further investigation.\nInvestigations are ongoing for the other three suspects.\nThe agencies warned that buying, selling, conveying, delivering, storing, keeping, possessing and dealing with duty-unpaid goods are serious offences under the Customs Act and the GST Act.\nThe ICA said it will continue to conduct security checks at the checkpoints and work with other agencies to prevent smuggling attempts.\nOffenders can be fined up to 40 times the amount of duty and GST evaded, jailed for up to six years, or both.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/four-arrested-over-9000-cartons-of-duty-unpaid-cigarettes-seized-in-joint-customs-ica"}
