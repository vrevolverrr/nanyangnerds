The prosecutors contended he had unintentionally killed his daughter, who was unexpectedly not at school, as well.\nWhen police investigators found the partially deflated ball in the car’s boot in November 2015, the stopper was missing.\nThey then found a yoga ball stopper in a drawer in Khaw’s study in 2016, leading the prosecution to suggest to a trial jury in 2018 that it may be from the ball placed in the car.\nAfter a 21-day trial, the jury in September 2018 found him guilty of two counts of murder, with High Court Judge Barnes sentencing him to life in prison for each count of murder.\nThere was no evidence to connect the stopper found in the drawer with the yoga ball in the Mini Cooper, wrote the appeal court judges in their judgment on Nov 21, with other yoga balls also found at Khaw’s family residence.\nThe judge’s misdirection had allowed the jury to ignore the possibility that the stopper was displaced or mistakenly taken away by police officers, which would lead to the jury eliminating Lily as the person who placed the yoga ball in the car, added the appeal court judges.\nIn their appeal, Khaw’s lawyers offered the alternative possibility that his daughter Lily had placed the yoga ball in the car to kill insects she was terrified of. In recorded interviews, Khaw had also previously suggested Lily may have committed suicide with the lethal gas, claiming he had told only her about the contents of the ball.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hk-court-orders-retrial-for-malaysian-jailed-for-killing-wife-daughter-with-gas-filled-yoga-ball"}
