The immersive role-playing experience will help them and other visitors become more aware of the impact their daily actions may have on their neighbours, and simple practical steps they can take to better communicate with them and reduce noise. We will continue our outreach to schools and grassroots organisations.\nTo measure the labâ€™s effectiveness, we survey visitors on their takeaways and feedback after the experience. So far, more than 90 per cent of visitors have agreed that the experience has helped them better understand what causes neighbour noise, how it travels and ways to mitigate it. A similar proportion said they would talk to their neighbours first to resolve noise disturbances, instead of reporting the matter to the authorities. We are very encouraged by this feedback.\nThe Noise Experiential Lab will run until Dec 15. Admission is free and members of the public can sign up for a visit through www.go.gov.sg/noiselab. MSO also welcomes tours by groups, who can write in to events@grid.com.sg", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-most-visitors-to-noise-lab-have-positive-feedback"}
