These are most likely not complaints about harassment, but fear of our citizens, panic, many want to leave. We are now monitoring the situation, we have more people coming (to Tajikistan) than leaving,” Ms Shakhnoza Nodiri, deputy head of the ministry, was quoted by Russian state news agency Tass as saying.\nTajikistan detained nine people this week suspected of having links to the mass shooting and also to the militant Islamist State group that claimed responsibility, a Tajik security source told Reuters.\nA labour shortage in Russia’s economy may become even worse due to the outflow of migrant workers, with a deficit in the construction industry growing by 36 per cent in 2024 compared with 2022, Mr Anton Glushkov, president of the National Association of Builders, told Interfax news agency on March 29.\nThe Russian Central Bank has said that staff shortages and resulting jump in wages were among risks to inflation that have compelled it to keep the key interest rate elevated.\nTajikistan’s Labour Ministry expects that the outflow of migrants from Russia will be temporary.\nAccording to the ministry’s website, 652,014 labour migrants left the country in 2023 compared with 775,578 in 2022.
