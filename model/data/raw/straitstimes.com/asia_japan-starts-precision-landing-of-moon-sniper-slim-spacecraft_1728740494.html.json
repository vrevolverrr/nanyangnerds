Japan is also home to several private-sector space start-ups, and Jaxa aims to send an astronaut to the moon as part of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Artemis programme in the next few years.\nBut the Japanese space agency has recently faced multiple setbacks in rocket development, including the launch failure in March 2023 of its new flagship rocket, H3.\nThe failure caused widespread delays in Japan’s space missions, including Slim and a joint lunar exploration with India, which in August made a historic touchdown on the Moon’s south pole.\nJaxa has twice landed on small asteroids, but a moon landing is much more difficult because of gravity. Three lunar missions by Japanese start-up ispace, Russia’s space agency and American company Astrobotic have failed in the past year.\nOnly four nations – the former Soviet Union, the United States, China and India – have achieved a soft landing on the Moon’s surface.\nSlim’s successful touchdown and demonstration of the precision landing “will help Japan to keep its technology advanced at a very high level in the world”, Ritsumeikan University professor Kazuto Saiki said.\nProf Saiki developed Slim’s near-infrared camera that will analyse moon rocks after the touchdown.\n“Mistakes happen, but Japan is a very experienced space power – it’s conducted very complicated space operations for many years,” said Dr Bleddyn Bowen, a University of Leicester associate professor specialising in space policy.\n“Not as big as the United States or the Soviet Union of old or China today in terms of scale, but in terms of capability and niche advanced technologies, Japan has always been there.”\nSlim’s precision landing “won’t be a game changer”, but the demonstration of it and the lightweight probe manufacturing Japan has pursued might open up moonshots to space organisations worldwide by reducing the cost of each mission, Dr Bowen added.\nOn landing, Slim will also deploy two mini-probes – a hopping vehicle as big as a microwave oven and a baseball-sized wheeled rover – that will take pictures of the spacecraft.\nTech giant Sony Group, toy-maker Tomy and several Japanese universities jointly developed the robots.
