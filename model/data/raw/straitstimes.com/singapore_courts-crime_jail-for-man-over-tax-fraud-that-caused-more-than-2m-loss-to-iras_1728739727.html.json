Don provided the stock specifications, quantities, prices and customers to be indicated on the forged invoices.”\nTan and Yeo also worked together to forge 90 sales invoices purportedly issued by MSTPL over supposed sales to companies including CHTPL.\nOverall, the scheme resulted in the submission of fraudulent tax claims amounting to about $7.53 million to Iras.\nFrom this amount, Iras paid out more than $2 million in tax refund claims. The court heard that Tan received a commission of more than $19,000 for operating MSTPL with Yeo.\nIn an unrelated case, the sole proprietor of another firm not linked to the ruse issued Tan a cash cheque for $39,500 in 2019 to buy computer servers.\nTan encashed the cheque and used the money to cover his loss arising from operating a pub that has since shuttered.\nHis bail was set at $70,000 on Sept 23, and he is expected to begin serving his sentence in November.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-man-over-tax-fraud-that-caused-more-than-2m-loss-to-iras"}
