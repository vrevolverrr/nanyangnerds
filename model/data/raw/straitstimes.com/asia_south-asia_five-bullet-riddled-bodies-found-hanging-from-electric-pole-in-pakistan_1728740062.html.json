Doctors have ascertained that the cause of death is multiple bullet wounds, mostly in the chest area.”\nHe said the men were likely killed on Aug 15.\nNo missing persons reports were registered with the local police and the men had not yet been identified, he added.\nBalochistan, Pakistan’s least populous province, is home to several militant groups, some fighting for independence or a greater share of the region’s mineral resources, with security forces often the target of bombings.\nIslamist groups are also behind sectarian violence in the region.
