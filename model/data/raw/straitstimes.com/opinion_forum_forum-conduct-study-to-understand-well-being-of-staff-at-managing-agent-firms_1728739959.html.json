It was also reported that BCA will explore introducing a performance-rating survey for MCSTs to rate their MAs.\nI would like to suggest that BCA conduct a study to better understand the welfare and well-being of MA staff. Anecdotal evidence suggests high staff turnover in the MA industry due to reasons like poor working conditions, and physical and mental abuse from residents or management council members.\nOver the years, cases of condominium managers being abused have been reported, and Forum letters have also been written on the need to protect managing agent staff.\nA study on the working conditions, abuse faced at work and the turnover rate of MAs would better guide BCA and industry partners on building a more holistic framework to improve performance of MAs, as poorly treated and abused workers cannot provide professional and quality service in the long run.\nThis would not only benefit MAs but also contribute to the better management of strata-titled properties, making them safer and more harmonious environments for residents, tenants and visitors alike.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-conduct-study-to-understand-well-being-of-staff-at-managing-agent-firms"}
