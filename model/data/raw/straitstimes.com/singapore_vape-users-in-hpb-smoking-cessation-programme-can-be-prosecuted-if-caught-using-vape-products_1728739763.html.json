It is illegal to buy, use or own an electronic vaporiser or vape here.\nIn a joint statement in December 2023, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and MOH said enforcement and education efforts against vaping would be stepped up to prevent it from gaining a foothold in Singapore.\nThe statement came as more users here were caught buying vapes online and from overseas despite the ban on such products.\nIn 2022, 4,916 people were caught for the offence, compared with 1,266 in 2020 and 4,697 in 2021.\nThe Ministry of Education told The Straits Times in October 2023 that it had referred about 800 students, including those from primary schools, to HSA in 2022. Some were issued fines.\nThe vaping situation in Singapore has been worsening steadily, with 1,656 e-vaporiser-related cases reported in December 2023 alone.\nThe scourge is a global problem, with Britainâ€™s government in October proposing banning younger generations from ever buying cigarettes and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying it also needed to act on youth vaping.\nOn Dec 14, the World Health Organisation urged governments to treat e-cigarettes in a similar way to tobacco and ban all flavours, threatening the bets tobacco companies have made on smoking alternatives.\nBuying, owning or using a vaporiser in Singapore can result in fines of up to $2,000.\nFirst-time offenders who import, distribute, sell or offer for sale e-vaporisers and their components can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.\nThose who have information on the illegal possession, use, purchase, import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of e-vaporisers can call the Tobacco Regulation Branch on 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 during office hours.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/vape-users-in-hpb-smoking-cessation-programme-can-be-prosecuted-if-caught-using-vape-products"}
