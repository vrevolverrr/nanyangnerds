Also, 75 per cent of employees who can work from home will be allowed to return to their workplaces.\nMeanwhile, the meetings and events industry celebrated the relaxation of gatherings to 75 per cent capacity for venues capable of hosting more than 1,000 people.\nShares of Suntec Reit, whose downtown venue hosts major meetings, exhibitions, conventions and events, besides retail and F&B outlets, rose four cents, or 2.4 per cent, to its highest close in two years, at $1.74.\nMeanwhile, taxi operator ComfortDelgro’s stock gained six cents, or 4.2 per cent, to $1.48 on optimism that the opening of the economy would boost demand for its services.
