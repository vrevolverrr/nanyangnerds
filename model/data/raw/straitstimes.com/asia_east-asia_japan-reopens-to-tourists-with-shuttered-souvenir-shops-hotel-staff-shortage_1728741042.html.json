The government had a goal of 40 million in 2020 timed with the Summer Olympics until both were upended by the coronavirus.\nMr Kishida said last week the government is aiming to attract 5 trillion yen (S$49.2 billion) in annual tourist spending. But that goal may be too ambitious for a sector that has atrophied during the pandemic.\nHotel employment slumped 22 per cent between 2019 and 2021, according to government data.\nSpending from overseas visitors will reach only 2.1 trillion yen by 2023 and won't exceed pre-Covid levels until 2025, wrote Nomura Research Institute economist Takahide Kiuchi in a report.\nFlag carrier Japan Airlines has seen inbound bookings triple since the border easing announcement, president Yuji Akasaka said last week. Even so, international travel demand won't fully recover until around 2025, he added.\nAmina Collection has shut its three souvenir shops at Narita and is unlikely to reopen them until next spring, said its president Sawato Shindo. The company reallocated staff and supplies from the airport to other locations in its 120-shop chain around Japan as it refocused on domestic tourism during the pandemic.\n\"I don't think there's going to be a sudden return to the pre-pandemic situation,\" Mr Shindo said. \"Restrictions are still pretty strict compared to other countries.\"\nJapan still strongly encourages that people wear masks indoors and refrain from loud talking. The Cabinet on Friday approved changing hotel regulations so that they can refuse guests who do not obey infection controls during an outbreak.\nMany service workers found better working conditions and wages in other fields over the past two years, so luring them back may be difficult, said a consultant for tourism companies who asked not to be identified.\n\"The hospitality industry is very infamous for low wages. So if the government values tourism as a key industry, financial support or subsidies are probably needed,\" he added.\nThe Japanese government is starting a domestic travel initiative this month that offers transportation and accommodation discounts, similar to its Go To Travel campaign in 2020 that was cut short following a surge in Covid infections.\nTight labour market\nAlmost 73 per cent of hotels nationwide said they were short of regular workers in August, up from about 27 per cent a year earlier, according to market research firm Teikoku Databank.\nIn Kawaguchiko, a lake town at the foot of Mt Fuji, inns had difficulty staffing before the pandemic amid Japan's tight labour market, and they anticipate a similar bottleneck now, said a trade group staffer who asked not to be identified.\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ms Akihisa Inaba, general manager at the hot-spring resort Yokikan in Shizuoka, central Japan, who said short staffing during the summer meant workers had to forego time off.\n\"Naturally, the labour shortage will become more pronounced when inbound travel returns,\" said Ms Inaba. \"So, I'm not so sure we can be overjoyed.\"\nWhether overseas visitors wear face masks and abide by other common infection controls in Japan is another concern.\nThe strict border controls were broadly popular during most of the pandemic, and fears remain about the appearance of new viral variants.\n\"From the start of the pandemic until now, we've had just a few foreign guests,\" said Mr Sawa, the Tokyo inn keeper.\n\"Pretty much all of them wore masks, but I'm really not sure whether the people who visit from here on will do the same. My plan is to kindly ask them to wear a mask while inside the building,\" he added.
