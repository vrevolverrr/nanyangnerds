But it adds another avenue for Ukraine to recruit Russian deserters, this one with a distinctly modern twist to the age-old tactic of informational warfare.\nAnd if nothing else, it may further the erosion of Russian morale on the battlefield.\nRussian defeats have already provided an opening for Ukraine to exploit that low morale, especially in the months after the Kremlin’s September mobilisation, which has sent thousands of new recruits into fierce battles with little training and scant supplies.\nMr Petro Yatsenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for Treatment of Prisoners of War, said in an interview on Monday that Ukraine has had more than 4,300 direct requests for information on how to surrender through the “I want to live” programme.\nIt is not possible to independently verify the claims.\nMr Yatsenko said the military would not release information about the number of Russians in Ukrainian captivity for security reasons.\nMr Andriy Yusov, who represents the intelligence department in Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, said Ukraine had received 1.2 million inquiries about the programme since it was set up on Sept 18. Most of the queries are coming from Russia, he said, and the vast majority involved appeals from “people who are studying for themselves or their relatives the possibility of saving life in the bloody and unjust war”.\nFor the past 10 months, both Russia and Ukraine have engaged in robust informational campaigns targeting enemy soldiers with leaflets, social media posts, radio appeals, text messages and television campaigns, all dedicated to convincing them to surrender.\nIn May, when the Russians were laying waste to towns and cities and beginning to gobble up land in eastern Ukraine, not all the guns were loaded with explosives.\nSome Soviet-era self-propelled howitzers had shells set up to explode in the air and scatter leaflets over Ukrainian-controlled territory, according to Zvezda, a Russian state-owned nationwide TV network run by the Russian Ministry of Defence.\n“We give the last warning to the Ukrainian Nazis to surrender,” an artilleryman named Vadim told the station.\nMore recently, the Russians announced that its drone operators were sending SMS messages to Ukrainian mobile phone subscribers telling them to lay down their arms.\nThere’s no evidence Russia’s “text-to-surrender” drones have had any impact.\nMr Yatsenko, the spokesperson for the prisoner of war group, said that Ukrainians were also giving captured Russian soldiers who are released as part of prisoner of war exchanges e-cards with information about how to surrender.\nThat way, he said, if they are thrown back into the fight, they know how to give themselves up.\nWhen Ukraine captures Russian soldiers, it sends them to prisoner of war camps. The main one is in the north-west, near Lviv.\nUkraine has allowed some tightly controlled media visits inside that camp. They also allow routine visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nThe most far-reaching Ukrainian effort is the “I want to live” programme, which includes a Telegram channel in Russian that now has more than 40,000 subscribers, mainly in Russia or Russian-controlled territories.\nPhone operators also work around the clock at an undisclosed location in Kyiv taking up to 100 calls daily, Mr Yatsenko said.\nBut just as surrendering was considered one of the most dangerous acts on the battlefield of World War I, the same is true in Ukraine today.\nWith a front line sprawling over hundreds of kilometres and the lands between the trenches a treacherous wasteland of mines watched over by snipers and subject to near-constant bombardment, arranging a surrender presents dangers for all involved.\nThat is where drones come in.\nThe surrender that was caught on the video released in November and geolocated by military analysts to the eastern Donbas region was an accident of sorts, Mr Yatsenko said.\nIt was not planned and the fact that it worked - with all the possible things that could have gone wrong - made the Ukrainian military think that it was an idea that could be expanded on, he said.\nThe Ukrainian General Staff set about producing a slick video with instructions for how Russian soldiers can surrender to a drone that was ready by early December.\nThe first step is to call the “I want to live” project and receive instructions and coordinates.\n“It is important to arrive at the indicated point on time, and wait for the appearance of the quadcopter, after which, raise your hands,” the video informs Russians.\n“After the drone shows the vector of movement, the prisoners must follow the drone,” they are told. The drone will fly at “walking speed” and “guide you to Ukrainian positions”.\nIf the drone’s battery fails, then the soldier must wait for a new one to arrive to continue moving.\nMr Yatsenko said the “how to surrender to a drone” programme is only in its infancy. He would not offer precise numbers for Russians who have surrendered to drones so far, but said it was more than a handful.\nThe Ukrainian program, Mr Yatsenko said, is the first one designed to use drones on a broad scale as part of a coordinated operation to encourage surrender.\n“We are giving them a last chance to save their life,” he said.
