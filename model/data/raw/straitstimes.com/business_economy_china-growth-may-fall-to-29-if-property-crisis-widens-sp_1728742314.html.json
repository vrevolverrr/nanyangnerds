The rating agency sees a 20 per cent probability of it happening, with Beijing providing no significant government stimulus to the sector, nor discretionary fiscal or monetary support.\n“Property pain is dragging on China’s economic rebound, which further hits property sales in a negative feedback loop,” said analyst Eunice Tan, head of credit research for Asia-Pacific at S&P Global Ratings.\nEven as the latest economic data topped forecasts and put the government’s growth goal of about 5 per cent in 2023 within reach, pessimism remains. The International Monetary Fund in October lowered its forecast for China’s growth in 2024 to 4.2 per cent due to serious headwinds from the real estate sector.\nReal estate directly makes up around 13 per cent of China’s GDP, although S&P says its overall footprint is approximately twice as large. This creates a domino effect of problems in the financial system and local government fiscal profiles.\nMeasures to encourage home purchases have so far done little to slow the slump. New home prices in major cities fell at the fastest pace in almost a year in September. The value of output by the real estate sector as a whole contracted 2.7 per cent in the third quarter, the biggest quarterly drop in 2023, according to China’s statistics bureau.\nIn S&P’s base-case scenario, property sales will decline between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in 2023 from the prior year, and shrink a further 5 per cent in 2024.\nChina’s economic growth will decline to 4.4 per cent in that scenario, broadly in line with the 4.5 per cent median estimate in a recent Bloomberg survey.
