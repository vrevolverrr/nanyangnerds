You do not need to deal with geopolitics anymore\".\nLater this month, economic leaders and central bank chiefs from the group will meet in Rio de Janeiro, where the annual summit of G20 leaders is scheduled for November 18-19.\nLast year, the G20 summit in New Delhi ended with a leaders' declaration that avoided condemning Russia for the war, although it highlighted the human suffering the conflict had caused and called on all states not to use force to grab territory.
