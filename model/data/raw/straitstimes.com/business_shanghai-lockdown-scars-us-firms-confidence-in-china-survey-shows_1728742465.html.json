Not only are tensions between their home country and China rising, but the predictability of doing business in China has also been shattered by its zero Covid-19 policy, which has also undermined economic growth and prospects for profits.\n“Rigid Covid-19 measures have upended business performance expectations and optimism,” said Mr Eric Zheng, president of AmCham Shanghai.\nCompanies still see growth potential in the market, but “to restore business confidence, China should pivot to a more sensible approach to managing Covid-19 based on a reasonable balance between public health and the economy”, he said.\nOnly 55 per cent of respondents described themselves as optimistic about China’s five-year business outlook – a record low, falling below levels during the trade war and the beginning of the pandemic.\nHowever, only 53 firms said they were considering moving operations out of the country within the next three years, with uncertainty about United States-China relations cited as the top reason, followed by Covid-19-related supply chain issues.\nThe report noted that large multinationals were more optimistic about their prospects in China than smaller firms and were continuing to invest in the country. This follows a similar pattern to European firms, with a recent study showing that nearly 80 per cent of European investment in China over the past three years came from just 10 firms.\nChina’s economy rebounded somewhat in the third quarter, but profits of foreign industrial firms fell 9.3 per cent in the first nine months of the year, according to separate data released this week.\nThe impact of zero Covid-19 policies on business confidence was “sobering”, but they were only partly to blame for the rising concern about companies’ prospects, according to AmCham Shanghai chairman Sean Stein.\n“There has also been a lack of transparency in terms of government regulation and intellectual property protection, and that creates risks for their operations,” he said.\n“China is becoming less competitive for foreign investment and firms and, unless that changes, foreign firms can and will go elsewhere.” BLOOMBERG", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/shanghai-lockdown-scars-us-firms-confidence-in-china-survey-shows"}
