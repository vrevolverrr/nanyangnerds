Brain bleeding occurred in 31 per cent of the donanemab group and about 14 per cent of the placebo group.\nThe deaths of three trial patients were linked to the treatment, researchers reported.\n“These side effects should not be taken lightly,” but most cases were manageable by monitoring with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or stopping the drug, said study investigator Dr Liana Apostolova, a professor in Alzheimer’s Disease research at Indiana University School of Medicine.\nDoctors are likely to use “very stringent MRI safety screening while we treat these patients”, she said.\nDonanemab, like Eisai and Biogen’s recently approved Leqembi, is an intravenous antibody designed to remove deposits of a protein called beta amyloid from the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.\nLilly said donanemab’s treatment effect continued to increase relative to a placebo over the course of the 18-month trial, even for participants who had been taken off the drug after their levels of amyloid deposits fell significantly.\n“At the end of the trial, the average patient had been without (the) drug for seven months, and yet they continued to benefit,” Ms White said.\nShe said the findings support the idea that donanemab can be stopped once amyloid is cleared from the brain.\nThe company said in May that the study had met all of its goals, showing that donanemab slowed cognitive decline by 29 per cent compared to a placebo in 1,182 people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia whose brains had deposits of two key Alzheimer’s proteins, beta amyloid and tau.\nFor high tau patients, donanemab was shown to slow disease progression by about 17 per cent, while the benefit was 35 per cent for those with low-to-intermediate tau levels.\nThe full study results were presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Amsterdam and published in American medical journal Jama.\n“Whether the harms of these drugs are balanced by their modest clinical benefits will ultimately require more data,” an editorial in Jama alongside the study said.\nLilly expects the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decide by the end of this year whether to approve donanemab. It said submissions to other global regulators are underway, and most will be completed by year end.\nThe FDA this month granted standard approval to Leqembi, the first Alzheimer’s disease-modifying treatment to achieve that goal, clearing the way for wider insurance coverage of the drug.\nBoth medications are also being studied in large trials to see if they have an impact on delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms.\nMore than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s, and that number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
