They were the last of 12 Nasa astronauts to walk on the Moon during a total of six Apollo missions starting in 1969.\nThe Artemis programme, named after the twin sister of Apollo, marks a major turning point for Nasa, redirecting its human spaceflight programme beyond low-Earth orbit after decades focused on space shuttles and the International Space Station.\nRe-entry marked the single most critical phase of Orion’s journey, testing whether its newly designed heat shield can withstand atmospheric friction and safely protect astronauts who would be on board.\n“It is our priority-one objective,” Nasa’s Mr Sarafin said at a briefing last week. “There is no arc-jet or aerothermal facility here on Earth capable of replicating hypersonic re-entry with a heat shield of this size.”\nNasa officials have stressed the experimental nature of the Artemis I mission, marking the first launch of the Boeing-built SLS and the first combined with Orion, which previously flew a brief two-orbit test launched on a smaller Delta IV rocket in 2014. The capsule was built by Lockheed Martin.\nCompared with Apollo, born of the Cold War-era US-Soviet space race, Artemis is more science-driven and broad-based, enlisting other countries and commercial partners such as Mr Elon Musk’s SpaceX and the space agencies of Europe, Canada, and Japan.\nOrion’s European Space Agency (ESA)-supplied service module, a housing for its propulsion system that was jettisoned before the capsule’s descent into Earth’s atmosphere, “performed beautifully”, ESA’s mission manager Philippe Deloo said in a statement.\n“This is a great day not only for America, but it’s a great day for all of our international partners – that’s the difference from 50 years ago,” Mr Nelson said.\nREUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/nasas-orion-capsule-returns-to-earth-capping-artemis-i-flight-around-moon"}
