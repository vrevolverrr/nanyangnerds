According to the magazine Airport World, multiple trials of such algorithms are under way in places such as China, the Netherlands and the United States.\nCAG said the development and trial of the new security screening technology – which is known in the industry as an Automated Prohibited Items Detection System (Apids) – is still in its early stages.\nIt is currently being used only to assist security officers at Changi Airport by highlighting items it recognises as a threat.\nThe eventual goal, however, is to increase the level of automation so that security officers need manually check and review only the bags that the system has flagged. This is similar to how security screening is conducted for checked baggage now.\n“As the technology matures, Changi will decide whether to expand its use across the airport,” said CAG in the November issue of its e-magazine Changi Journeys.\n“This is expected to further improve the speed of clearance by up to 50 per cent, as well as enabling manpower resources to be optimised and redeployed to other areas,” it added.\nWhile it noted that security screening operations are one of the most manpower-intensive touchpoints at the airport, CAG declined to say how many security screeners currently work there.\nCAG said its trials are currently focused on improving the system’s capabilities.\n“With the number of bags increasing as air travel continues to recover strongly at Changi Airport and passengers packing more items into their bags, one key area of improvement for Apids is to reduce the rate of false alarms to make it operationally viable, as well as to expand the list of prohibited items that it can detect,” it added.\nPassenger traffic at Changi Airport in September 2023 was at 89 per cent of pre-pandemic levels in 2019, with 4.87 million passengers passing through.\nCAG said the AI system has to be trained to recognise benign items as well, so that it flags only items of concern or unknown objects.\nMore work is needed on the regulatory front too.\nWhile protocols have been developed in Europe to assess if Apids can meet international security screening standards, CAG said further discussion is needed among international bodies and state regulators on policies for adopting this new technology.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/changi-airport-trialling-ai-to-improve-security-screenings-for-carry-on-luggage"}
