Permanent residents (PRs) buying a second or subsequent residential unit had to pay ABSD of 3 per cent, while foreigners paid 10 per cent ABSD for every property.\nThese rates have been raised a few times since 2011. Following the April 2023 round of cooling measures, Singaporeans now pay 20 per cent ABSD on their second property, and 30 per cent on their third and subsequent properties. PRs buying their second property pay 30 per cent, and 35 per cent for third and subsequent properties, and foreigners will have to pay 60 per cent ABSD for any property.\nSeparately, Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) asked National Development Minister Desmond Lee if his ministry would consider requests for the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (Vers) from residents living in ageing blocks older than 50 years but less than 70 years that have substantially deteriorated.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/iras-to-claw-back-60m-from-166-private-property-deals-exploiting-99-to-1-loophole-to-dodge-absd"}
