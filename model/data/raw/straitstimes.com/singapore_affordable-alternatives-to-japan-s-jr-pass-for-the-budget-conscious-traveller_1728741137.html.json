Japanese citizens who do not reside in the country are also allowed to use them.\nCurrently, travellers hoping to cover multiple popular destinations such as Tokyo, Osaka and Hokkaido in a single trip can purchase a regular seven-day rail pass at 29,650 yen (S$273).\nA return trip on the shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka without the pass, for example, will cost about 29,000 yen.\nIn October, the same pass will cost 50,000 yen. A 14-day pass covering all JR lines will rise to 80,000 yen, up from 47,250 yen now.\nBut travellers can still enjoy the pass at the current price if they order it before Oct 1.\nSeveral online third-party travel platforms such as Klook have a cut-off purchase date of Sept 25, while the official JR Pass website states that it will be on sale at certain physical sales offices in Japan until Sept 30.\nFollowing that, travellers can activate the pass within 90 days from the date of issue. When activating the pass in Japan, they can also choose a start date that is up to 30 days in the future. In other words, some travellers may be able to enjoy the current price until late January.\nDespite the JR Pass still being a valuable and convenient option after the price hike, there are other options that continue to be viable alternatives for budget-conscious travellers.\n1. Regional train passes\nThe price hikes announced in April by the JR Group covered the nationwide rail passes, with increases for its regional passes announced in July.\nRegional train passes are nowhere near as all-encompassing as the JR Pass, but they offer unlimited travel within specific areas – perfect for those who plan their trip around one or two connecting areas.\nThese passes, which are available only to international tourists visiting Japan, were previously a fraction of the price of a JR Pass.\nBut the price hike saw them increase anywhere from 5 per cent for the five-day Hokkaido Rail Pass to as much as 50 per cent for the JR East Tohoku Area Pass, which covers the Kanto and Tohoku regions. This rose from 20,000 yen to 30,000 yen.\nJR Group justified the revision by saying it would expand the lines covered by the passes and introduce automatic ticket gates, as well as increase the number of seats allocated for reservations for some passes.\nThe transport authority also added that pass holders will receive certain perks, such as discounts at selected stores.\nHowever, despite the increase, regional passes are still cheaper alternatives to the all-encompassing JR Pass, especially if you plan your trips around them.\nThe JR Pass website lists more than 20 regional passes available for sale that cover several areas including Kyushu, Kansai and Mount Fuji.\n3. Buses\nIf criss-crossing train tracks and roundabout routes are not for you, perhaps trusty buses may be the way to go.\nThe Japan Bus Pass, sold by transport operator Willer Express, offers unlimited travel on its various bus routes throughout the country – excluding Hokkaido and Okinawa – across a set number of days.\nDates of travel can be chosen within two months of purchase, and do not have to be on consecutive days.\nAccording to the japan-guide.com website, a traveller utilising the pass will pay only about 3,000 yen for a trip from Tokyo to Hiroshima, compared with a regular train ticket which can cost up to 18,000 yen.\nAnyone holding a non-Japanese passport will be eligible to buy the pass, including non-Japanese citizens living in Japan, foreign students and long-term travellers.\nTo kill two birds with one stone, travellers can also opt for overnight highway buses, saving on accommodation through the night as well. After all, there is nothing better than to magically awaken already at your destination.\nSeat reservations are required for each ride and can be made online until one hour before departure.\nWiller’s bus network is centred on Japan’s two primary urban areas, Tokyo and Osaka/Kyoto, and connects with secondary cities across the country. This means that those based around the primary areas will be able to shuttle back and forth, but will not be able to travel between secondary cities directly.\nTwo options are currently available.\nThe first, a Monday To Thursday Pass, offers options of a three-day pass for 10,200 yen, five-day pass for 12,800 yen and seven-day pass for 15,300 yen. This cannot be used on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.\nThe second, an All Day Pass, offers a three-day option at 12,800 yen or a five-day option at 15,300 yen.\nBoth types of passes cannot be used during certain blackout periods spanning one or two days before and after Golden Week, Obon and the New Year holidays.\nFor example, 2023’s Golden Week spanned April 29 to May 5. The blackout period for the Japan Bus Pass was from April 28 to May 7.\nObon lasted from Aug 13 to 16, with the blackout dates being Aug 10 to 16.\nThe blackout period for New Year holidays began before Christmas on Dec 23, 2022, and ended on Jan 3, 2023.\nThe actual blackout dates for 2024 have yet to be listed on the Willer Express website. Those who wish to purchase the pass near these periods should check for updates on its website before purchasing.\nThe pass can be used for up to one overnight and two daytime bus rides a day on buses operated by Willer Express, but does not cover the same route in the same direction twice on the same day – for example, two rides from Osaka to Hiroshima.\nTravel on the same route but in different directions, such as a trip from Osaka to Hiroshima and back, is allowed.\nOvernight buses departing after midnight count as a ride taken the previous day.\nA sample itinerary on japan-guide.com for a popular series of destinations spanning Tokyo, Hiroshima, Kyoto and back to Tokyo known as the “Golden Route” will cost about 40,000 yen with regular train tickets. The same route costs 29,650 yen with the JR Pass, and has to take place across seven days.\nVia the Japan Bus Pass, travelling along the “Golden Route” costs 10,200 yen, and can be used across up to two months.\nHighway buses are also a viable option for those who do not wish to be restricted by a pass. Leading bus companies offering such services include Willer Express, as well as JR Bus.\nHowever, prices often vary by date instead of route. Willer Express highway bus tickets from Tokyo to Osaka in May cost between 2,800 yen and 6,000 yen, while those in June cost between 3,900 yen and 6,000 yen.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/affordable-alternatives-to-japan-s-jr-pass-for-the-budget-conscious-traveller"}
