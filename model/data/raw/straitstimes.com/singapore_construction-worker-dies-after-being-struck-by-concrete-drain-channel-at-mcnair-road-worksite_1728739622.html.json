He was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic from the Singapore Civil Defence Force.\nThe site occupier and employer of the worker is Kay Lim Construction & Trading.\nThe developer for the project – which is understood to be the McNair Heights Build-To-Order project – is the Housing Board.\nIn a statement on Oct 11, HDB expressed its condolences to the victim’s family. “Together with the building contractor, Kay Lim Construction & Trading Pte Ltd, we will render all the support and assistance needed to them in this difficult time,” said HDB.\nThe MOM spokesperson said the ministry is investigating the incident and has instructed Kay Lim to stop all lifting of precast concrete drain channels at the worksite.\nMOM also urged employers and workers to remain vigilant.\nIts spokesperson added that, from Oct 14, the ministry would be “stepping up enforcement efforts in high-risk sectors to reinforce the importance of strict adherence to safety regulations and deter any complacency”. The efforts would include larger construction projects and smaller-scale ones involving addition, alteration and renovation works.\nPolice investigations are ongoing.\nST has contacted Kay Lim for comment.\nThe first half of 2024 saw 19 workplace deaths, according to mid-year workplace safety and health figures released by MOM. Five of these were from the construction sector.\nVehicular incidents were the top cause of workplace deaths in the first six months of 2024, followed by falls from height, and the collapse or breakdown of structures and equipment.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/construction-worker-dies-after-being-struck-by-concrete-drain-channel-at-mcnair-road-worksite"}
