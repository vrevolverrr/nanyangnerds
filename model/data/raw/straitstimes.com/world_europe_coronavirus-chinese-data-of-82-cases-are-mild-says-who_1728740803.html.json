By contrast, there are currently only 12 cases of people afflicted with the coronavirus in the US.\nHowever, some have pointed out that scientists have studied the seasonal flu for years while the coronavirus is still a relative unknown.\n\"Despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there's a certainty â€¦ of seasonal flu,\" Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Jan 31.\n\"I can tell you all, guaranteed, that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down. You could predict pretty accurately what the range of the mortality is and the hospitalisations (will be),\" Dr Fauci said.\n\"The issue now with (the coronavirus) is that there's a lot of unknowns.\"\nSources: Reuters, Agence France-Presse, BBC", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-chinese-data-of-82-cases-are-mild-says-who"}
