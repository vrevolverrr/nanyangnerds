These corporate ventures will complement our vibrant start-up ecosystem to create exciting job opportunities and new entrepreneurial career pathways in Singapore,\" said Dr Beh.\nThe pilot programme, which will run for one year, has an expected capacity to support up to 20 companies through concept validation sprints.\nSuch sprints involve applying venture-building methodologies to develop ideas into an investible business, with a plan that is backed by data and validated through in-depth testing with the market within three to six months.\nEDB New Ventures will support up to half the cost of each concept validation sprint.\nHigh-potential ventures launched from this programme could receive further risk-sharing capital and value creation support beyond the sprints to see through their early stages of growth.\nMr Choo Heng Tong, executive vice-president of new ventures and innovation at EDB, said that while companies have the capacity to innovate, much of their focus is often on optimising core business operations.\n\"Building ventures with an agile and autonomous entrepreneurial team will allow them to effectively search and build new growth areas,\" Mr Choo said.\n\"Concept validation sprints with the support of venture studios allow companies to take a customer and market-first approach to determine what new business to build, and is often the first step in their corporate venturing journey.\"\nCompanies interested in the launchpad programme can visit EDB's website for more details. Applications are open from Thursday.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/edb-launches-10-million-programme-to-help-singapore-companies-venture-into-new-growth-areas"}
