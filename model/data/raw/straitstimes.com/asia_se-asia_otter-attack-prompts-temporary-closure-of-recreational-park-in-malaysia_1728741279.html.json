Thank you.” has been circulating on social media. There was also an announcement by Kota Kinabalu City Hall.\nThe order for closure was issued by the city hall in response to an incident on the morning of Sept 11, where the presence of aggressive otters posed a threat to parkgoers.\nMayor Sabin Samitah confirmed that a notice was distributed to the park operator to suspend activities until further notice.\nHe stressed that the closure was necessary to ensure the safety of visitors while the council, in collaboration with relevant agencies, conducts investigations.\n“The council takes this incident seriously and has acted swiftly to close Perdana Park to avoid any further incidents,” he said, urging the public to comply with the closure for their own safety.\nOn Sept 11, Ms Mariasella Harun was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital after she was attacked by a pack of otters while jogging on the Perdana Park tracks.\nTwo other joggers came to her rescue, but they were also attacked.\nSabah Wildlife Department director Roland Niun said this was the first otter attack reported in Sabah, and that it was unusual for this generally harmless animal to exhibit such aggression.\nBut he noted that otters tend to be aggressive when they feel threatened or provoked.\nOtters, a protected wildlife species under Schedule 2 of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997, have been spotted in several other recreation parks in Kota Kinabalu of late, particularly those closer to riverine areas and lakes.\n“As a precaution, we advise the public not to approach the otters, even though they do not typically attack humans,” said Mr Niun.\n“Please do not feed, pet or provoke them in any way.\n“This is also to avoid any disease transmission and to maintain the otters’ well-being.” THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/otter-attack-prompts-temporary-closure-of-recreational-park-in-malaysia"}
