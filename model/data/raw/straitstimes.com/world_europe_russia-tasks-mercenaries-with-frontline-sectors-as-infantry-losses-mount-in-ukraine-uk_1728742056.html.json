Fifteen people were injured when missiles hit military installations in Vyshhorod district on the edge of the capital, regional Governor Oleksiy Kuleba said on Telegram.\nAir raid sirens blared as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Parliament alongside visiting Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.\nThe attack shattered the sense of normalcy that has returned to life in Kyiv since Russian forces abandoned attempts to capture the city in the first weeks of the war, in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance.\nEastern front\nUkraine's counter-attacks in the south come as Russia continues to battle for control of the entirety of the industrialised Donbas region in the east, comprising the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nRussian forces shelled the town of Bakhmut, which has been cited by Russia as a prime target in its advance through Donetsk, four times on Thursday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. At least three people were killed and three were injured, he said.\nAs the fighting rages, international efforts continued to try to reopen Ukrainian ports and allow exports of grain and other commodities.\nAllowing safe passage for grain shipments from Ukraine should ease shortages that have left tens of millions of people around the world facing soaring food prices and hunger.\nRussia and Ukraine struck a deal last week to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports, but UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said \"crucial\" details for the safe passage of vessels were still being worked out.\nMr Griffiths was hopeful the first shipment of grain from a Ukrainian Black Sea port could take place as early as Friday.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-tasks-mercenaries-with-frontline-sectors-as-infantry-losses-mount-in-ukraine-uk"}
