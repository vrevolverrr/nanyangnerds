Negotiators have focused more on cutting greenhouse gas emissions than on the link to health.\nIn this episode, ST’s climate editor David Fogarty hosts Dr Maria Neira, the World Health Organisation’s top public health and environment official, to talk more about the importance of such issues on the COP’s first-ever Health Day.\nThey discuss why it is so urgent that nations take action now to tackle climate change and why doing so could be the ultimate public health opportunity.\nHighlights of conversation (click/tap above):\n1:06 Why is the climate crisis a health crisis? Key connections\n6:53 Why haven’t UN climate talks focused more strongly on the link between climate and human health?\n9:48 Dr Maria Neira: “If we reduce the bad quality of the air we breathe every year, we could save at least 5 million lives.”\n11:37 Tough action against climate change could be the ultimate public health opportunity\n13:34 Dr Maria Neira: “The moment people connect health and climate change, I think there will be an incredible increase in the sense of urgency.”\nProduced by: David Fogarty (dfogarty@sph.com.sg), Ernest Luis, Hadyu Rahim & Amirul Karim\nEdited by: Hadyu Rahim\nFollow Green Pulse Podcast here and rate us:\nChannel: https://str.sg/JWaf\nApple Podcasts: https://str.sg/JWaY\nSpotify: https://str.sg/JWag\nWebsite: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\nFeedback to: podcast@sph.com.sg\nFollow David Fogarty on X: https://str.sg/JLM6\nRead his articles: https://str.sg/JLMu\n---\nDiscover more ST podcast channels:\nCOE Watch: https://str.sg/iTtE\nIn Your Opinion: https://str.sg/w7Qt\nAsian Insider: https://str.sg/JWa7\nHealth Check: https://str.sg/JWaN\nGreen Pulse: https://str.sg/JWaf\nYour Money & Career: https://str.sg/wB2m\nST Sports Talk: https://str.sg/JWRE\n#PopVultures: https://str.sg/JWad\nMusic Lab: https://str.sg/w9TX\nDiscover ST Podcasts: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\n---\nSpecial edition series:\nTrue Crimes Of Asia (6 eps): https://str.sg/i44T\nThe Unsolved Mysteries of South-east Asia (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuZ2\nInvisible Asia (9 eps): https://str.sg/wuZn\nStop Scams (10 eps): https://str.sg/wuZB\nSingapore’s War On Covid (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuJa\n---\nFollow our shows then, if you like short, practical podcasts!", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/first-cop28-health-day-to-highlight-why-climate-crisis-is-a-health-crisis"}
