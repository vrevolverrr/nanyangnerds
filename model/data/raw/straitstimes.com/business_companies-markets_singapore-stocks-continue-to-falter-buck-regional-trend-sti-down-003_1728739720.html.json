It closed up 2.6 per cent at US$1.99, while Singtel was the biggest loser, 2.1 per cent lower at $3.22.\nThe local banks continued to slip, with DBS Bank down 0.2 per cent to $38.30, OCBC Bank off 0.3 per cent at $15.23 and UOB retreating 0.5 per cent to $32.36.\nMajor regional indexes rose despite Wall Street turning weaker after record-setting performances earlier in the week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average taking the biggest hit, falling 0.7 per cent. The Kospi in Seoul rose 2.9 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 4.2 per cent and Australian shares added 1 per cent, their biggest one-day rise in two weeks, to close just shy of a record high.\nThe US Federal Reserve’s rate cut should support Singapore market earnings for this half of 2024, said Mr Thilan Wickramasinghe, head of research at Maybank Securities Singapore.\nThere could be a floor to the downgrades on tech manufacturing and real estate investment trusts (Reits), while rising trends could drive upgrades for gaming, industrials, Internet and telcos.\n“We believe the recent bigger-than-expected Fed cuts, as it begins an easing cycle, should help ease funding costs for Reits and tech manufacturing, while also supporting the top line,” said Mr Wickramasinghe.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/singapore-stocks-continue-to-falter-buck-regional-trend-sti-down-003"}
