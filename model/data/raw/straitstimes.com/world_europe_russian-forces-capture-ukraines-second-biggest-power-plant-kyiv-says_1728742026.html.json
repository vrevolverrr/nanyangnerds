Ukraine and its allies call the invasion an unprovoked war of aggression.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he planned a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - the first between the two diplomats since before the start of the war.\nThe call in the coming days would not be “a negotiation about Ukraine,” Blinken said at a news conference, restating Washington’s position that any talks on ending the war must be between Kyiv and Moscow.\nRussia has received no formal request from Washington about a phone call between Blinken and Lavrov, TASS news agency reported.\nAside from discussing Americans detained by Russia, Blinken said he would raise with Lavrov the tentative deal on grain exports reached last week between Russia, the United States, Turkey and Ukraine.\nRussia reduced gas flows to Europe on Wednesday in an energy stand-off with the European Union. It has blocked grain exports from Ukraine since invading, but on Friday agreed to allow deliveries through the Black Sea to Turkey’s Bosphorus Strait and on to global markets.\nThe deal was almost immediately thrown into doubt when Russia fired cruise missiles at Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port, on Saturday, just 12 hours after the deal was signed.\nBefore the invasion and subsequent sanctions, Russia and Ukraine accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russian-forces-capture-ukraines-second-biggest-power-plant-kyiv-says"}
