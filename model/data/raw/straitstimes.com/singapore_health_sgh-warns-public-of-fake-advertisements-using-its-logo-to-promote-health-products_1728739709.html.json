They should also not purchase from unfamiliar or suspicious sources, and not be duped by false claims.\nScams in Singapore hit a record high of 46,563 reported cases in 2023 – the highest number since the police started tracking them in 2016.\nThe figure in 2023 is up 46.8 per cent from the 31,728 cases in 2022, and victims lost a total of $651.8 million in 2023.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/sgh-warns-public-of-fake-advertisements-using-its-logo-to-promote-health-products"}
