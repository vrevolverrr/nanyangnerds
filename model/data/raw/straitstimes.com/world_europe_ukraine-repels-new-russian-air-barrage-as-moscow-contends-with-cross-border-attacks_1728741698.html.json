Two women were travelling in one of them. They died from their injuries on the spot,” Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\nRussia said on Thursday it had repelled a second attempted incursion into the Belgorod region in just over a week by what it cast as pro-Ukrainian militants. Ukraine denies involvement.\nThe Freedom of Russia Legion blamed Russia for the shelling on messaging app Telegram, while posting images of what it said was one of its tanks in the nearby Russian village of Novaya Tavolzhanka and soldiers taking cover behind a wall during a gunfight.\n“Near Tavolzhanka, the enemy destroyed a Renault car with civilians, mistaking it for a car with our sabotage group. At least two civilians were killed, and this is a direct consequence of the lack of professionalism of Putin’s army,” the legion said on Telegram.\nThe group describes itself as Russians fighting against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government to create a Russia that would be part of the “free world”.\nAlong with the Russian Volunteer Corps founded by a far-right Russian nationalist, members of the group say that they are Russian volunteers attacking under their own steam, and not on Ukraine’s orders.\n‘Ill-wishers’\nMr Putin told a meeting of his Security Council on Friday that “ill-wishers” were increasingly trying to destabilise Russia.\n“We must do everything we can to make sure that under no circumstances will they be allowed to do this,” he said.\nThe governors of the Bryansk, Kursk, Smolensk and Kaluga regions all reported shelling or drone attacks, with some buildings damaged and energy infrastructure targeted, although no fires at oil facilities or injuries were reported.\nWithin Ukraine, Russia said a new offensive in the eastern Donetsk province had been launched by Chechen special forces, while a Russian-installed official said Ukrainian forces had hit a “hospital camp” in the Zaporizhzhia region.\nDonetsk and Zaporizhzhia are two of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed in the invasion launched by Mr Putin on Feb 24, 2022.\nThe attack aimed to “demilitarise” a country that Moscow said threatened Russian speakers and Russia with its moves towards the West.\nThousands of people in Ukraine have since been killed in Russian attacks, millions have fled and towns and cities have been devastated, particularly in Russian-speaking areas.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s military has been hugely strengthened with Western equipment and training.
