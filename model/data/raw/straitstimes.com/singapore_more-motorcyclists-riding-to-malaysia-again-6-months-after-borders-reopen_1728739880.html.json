On Sept 25, a day ride to Desaru in Johor planned for 50 motorcyclists attracted 190 riders and their pillion passengers. The event was organised by Mr Wang Ying Hao, branch manager of motorcycle shop Yew Heng Motorsports.\n“We were surprised as about half the participants were from the public,” said Mr Wang, 34, noting that participants of pre-Covid-19 events were mainly Yew Heng customers.\nThe large group was broken into seven smaller groups based on riding experience.\nOn that same weekend in Pahang, the Givi Rimba Raid 2022 saw 226 motorcyclists from the region take part in a 150km race in the jungle. There were over 30 participants from Singapore, a sharp increase from only two in 2019 before Covid-19 struck. Among them was Mr Kelvin Chia, who came in 10th overall, completing the gruelling race in 3hr 19min on his new 300cc KTM dirt bike.\nMr Chia, 50, said: “I couldn’t prepare for the race (because of Covid-19). For me, the race was a matter of endurance.”\nOn the sidelines, Didi Lifestyle, the authorised agent for Triumph motorcycles in Singapore, gathered eight local motorcyclists who rode a total of 1,400km to watch the event.\nThey travelled to Kuala Lumpur to join more than 30 riders from Malaysia, Britain, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia who departed for Pahang from the Givi factory which manufactures motorcycle accessories.\nSaid one rider, Mr Daniel Lim, 31, head of operations and projects for an oil company: “I felt quite tired as I am not used to riding long distances after (the pandemic). I need to build back stamina for long riding trips.”\nHe added that newer riders who obtained their licences during the pandemic may also take an interest in riding to Malaysia and boost the participation rates at such events.\nMr Eugene Mah, managing director of Didi Lifestyle and Givi Singapore, said venturing north on winding Malaysian roads and having a go at the Sepang International Circuit are exploits favoured by Singaporeans. The 5.54km race track in Selangor is a three-hour ride from Singapore. A rider can hit speeds of up to 290kmh there.\nOn Sept 29 and 30, motorcycle event organiser SBR Trackdays brought back its feature track event at the Sepang circuit after a hiatus of almost three years. The event attracted an enthusiastic turnout of 179 participants from Singapore and seven from Malaysia, said organiser Joseph Lee.\nPre-Covid-19, the event, which used to be held seven times a year, had around 150 Singapore participants and 50 Malaysian riders.\nOne of the participants, businessman Jonathan Yeo, 30, who rides a BMW S1000RR, said: “We have been keeping it in for too long. It was unbearable (for me).”\nSaid Mr Mah, 38: “In the last two years, companies have been trying to plan and market their brands online and on social media.”\n“There has always been an interest in riding events overseas. We live in a small country with limited space, so naturally, our events are also a lot smaller in scale,” he added.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-motorcyclists-riding-to-malaysia-again-6-months-after-borders-reopen"}
