The money was sent to a company she had set up in Slovenia and she received some in cash, prosecutors told the court.\nItalian police said Marogna had spent much of the money for personal use, including luxury brand clothing and visits to health spas. She is charged with embezzlement.\nThe other six defendants include the former president and director of the Vatican’s Financial Intelligence unit, the cardinal’s former secretary, Father Mauro Carlino, and three former Vatican employees.\nFour companies associated with individual defendants, two in Switzerland, one in the United States and one in Slovenia, were also indicted. The companies denied any wrongdoing. REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/cardinal-nine-other-defendants-await-verdicts-at-vatican-trial"}
