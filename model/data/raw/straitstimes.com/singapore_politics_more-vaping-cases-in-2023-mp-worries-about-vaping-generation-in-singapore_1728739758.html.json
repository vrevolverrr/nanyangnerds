She said there were about 7,600, 5,600 and 8,000 vaping-related offences in the respective years.\nMr Ang also asked whether HSA’s enforcement team had grown in the last three years, and whether there could be a “no wrong door” policy when the different agencies received feedback about vaping.\nAccording to the Public Service Division, under this policy, the agency that receives feedback on an issue that is not under its purview should identify the agency responsible and ensure that it will take up the case, before putting that organisation in touch with the person who provided the feedback.\nMr Ang raised his concerns about the younger generation picking up vaping.\nHe said: “We don’t want a young generation that’s a vaping generation in Singapore.”\nMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) asked whether the enforcement processes could be better aligned.\nMs Rahayu said the health authorities will continue to monitor the situation, and that the size of the enforcement team can be adjusted accordingly.\nVaping has been banned in Singapore since 2018.\nBuying, owning or using a vaporiser in Singapore can result in fines of up to $2,000.\nFirst-time offenders who import, distribute, sell or offer for sale e-vaporisers and their components can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.\nThe vaping situation in Singapore has been worsening steadily, with 1,656 e-vaporiser-related cases reported in December 2023.\nIn the largest seizure of vape products in Singapore, HSA uncovered more than 194,500 vape products worth over $3.1 million in a raid on a warehouse in Mandai in March 2023.\nTwo men were fined a total of $17,000 on March 7, 2024. The cases involving five others are still pending.\nMalaysian national See Hong Jian, who was involved in the Mandai warehouse operations, was sentenced to 10 months’ jail and fined $16,000 on Feb 1.\nSchools and institutes of higher learning have been ramping up education efforts to prevent vaping from gaining a foothold in Singapore.\nThe scourge is a global problem, with Britain’s government proposing banning younger generations from ever buying cigarettes and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying in October 2023 it needed to act against youth vaping.\nIn December 2023, the World Health Organisation urged governments to treat e-cigarettes in a similar way to tobacco and ban all flavours.\nThose who have information on the illegal possession, use, purchase, import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of e-vaporisers can call the Tobacco Regulation Branch on 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 during office hours.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/more-vaping-cases-in-2023-mp-worries-about-vaping-generation-in-singapore"}
