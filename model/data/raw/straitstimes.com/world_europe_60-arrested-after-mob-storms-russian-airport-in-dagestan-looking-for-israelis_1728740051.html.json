This will be done.”\nHe also claimed on Monday morning that the “initiators of this action are our enemies who organised it from Ukrainian territory”, according to Russia’s Ria-Novosti news agency.\nMr Melikov said the riots were instigated by posts on the Telegram messaging app from Utro Dagestan, run by “traitors” working from Ukraine.\nUtro Dagestan, a Telegram channel with around 60,000 followers, shared a post urging a mass gathering at the airport to prevent the arrival of “undesirable” passengers on the Red Wings flight.\nDagestan and Chechnya are mainly Muslim areas in a region that has witnessed years of violent tension with the central Russian authorities.\nThe RIA Novosti news agency reported on Sunday that a Jewish centre in another North Caucasus republic – Kabardino-Balkaria – had been set on fire in the city of Nalchik.\nDagestan is Russia’s southernmost territory and one of its poorest regions.\nIt has taken an active part in the Ukraine offensive – with independent reports showing it has sent proportionally more men to Ukraine than many more ethnically Russian regions.\nAFP, REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/60-arrested-after-mob-storms-russian-airport-in-dagestan-looking-for-israelis"}
