Charging speed will likely be faster when there are fewer EVs plugged in than when there are many vehicles charging at the same time.\nCharging up an average EV on such chargers will take between four and eight hours.\nDevelopments with fewer than eight car and motorcycle parking spaces will be exempted from having to put in the charging points. However, LTA said that such developments will still have to make the provisions in power supply when they undergo substantial renovation work.\nThe proposed law would also make it easier to install EV chargers in strata-titled developments like condominiums by lowering the approval threshold needed for such resolutions to be passed to 50 per cent of residents.\nThe current Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act requires support from up to 90 per cent of the residents before the proposals can be green lit.\nThe requirement to install chargers and provide additional power supply applies to developments that undergo works that include constructing a new building, rebuilding one, as well as electrical works that result in an increased electrical load of more than 280kVA.\nAll EV chargers in Singapore will also be regulated under the proposed laws. The installation, certification and use of chargers will have to comply with the updated national EV charging standard announced in March 2022, as well as with the code of practice for electrical installations.\nThe registered chargers would have to be inspected regularly. Only approved chargers can be advertised for sale.\nBusinesses that provide EV charging services will have to be licensed. Among the requirements, these companies will have to agree to share data with LTA, as well as have public liability insurance and ensure that the chargers in their network are operational. Their licences will be valid for a fixed period and can be renewed.\nIn the earlier proposal put up for public feedback, LTA said licensing these commercial operators was necessary for the authority to “effectively enforce against breaches of reliability and quality standards”.\nOn Wednesday, LTA said the industry and members of the public will be given time to comply with the new law, which is expected to take effect in the second half of 2023.\nExisting non-approved chargers can continue to be used and sold for a six-month period after the law comes into effect, while companies providing EV charging services have 12 months to be registered to continue operations.\nThe proposed law covers fixed chargers, including so-called “battery charge and swap” stations and pantograph chargers, as well as non-fixed chargers. It does not include chargers meant for non-EVs such as personal mobility devices and power-assisted bicycles.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/laws-proposed-to-regulate-ev-chargers-in-singapore-require-operators-to-be-licensed"}
