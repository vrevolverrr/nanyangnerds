Filings as recently as February show Shanghai as the listed address.\nThe Chinese company, which recently named Mr Zhao Jiazhen, one of the founding members of PDD, as chief executive, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nPDD reported revenue of 39.82 billion yuan (S$7.67 billion) in the fourth quarter, falling short of estimates for 41.01 billion yuan, based on Refinitiv data, as China’s post-reopening consumer recovery remains patchy.
