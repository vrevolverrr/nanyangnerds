They are non-humans,” said Zelensky.\nRussia denies deliberately targeting civilians. Vladimir Rogov, an official in the Russian-installed administration in the Zaporizhzhia region, blamed the attack on Ukrainian forces.\nPolice Colonel Sergey Ujryumov, head of the explosive disposal unit of the Zaporizhzhia police department, said the car market had been hit by three S300 missiles.\nUjryumov told Reuters that the Russian military “know that columns are formed here to go to the occupied territories. They had the coordinates.” “It’s not a coincidental strike. It’s perfectly deliberate,” he said.\nCorpses\nThe vehicles were packed with the occupants’ belongings, blankets and suitcases. Plastic sheets were draped over the bodies of a woman and young man in a green car. A dead cat lay next to the young man in the rear seat.\nTwo bodies lay in a white mini-van in front of another car, its windows blown out and the sides pitted with shrapnel.\nThe corpse of an elderly woman lay nearby, her shopping bag next to her.\nAnother woman, who gave her name as Nataliya, said she and her husband had been visiting their children in Zaporizhzhia.\n“We were returning to my mother who is 90 years old. We have been spared. It’s a miracle,” she said.\nNikola Rusak, a 62-year-old delivery driver from the southern province of Kherson, survived unscathed as he slept in his minivan, parked about 20m from a row of automobile parts shops that were hit by a missile.\n“I could not understand what was happening,” he said. “I got out and saw people running. I was in a daze. I was just standing there frozen. I didn’t know what to do,” he said.\nRusak said he had been sleeping in the vehicle for five days after dropping relatives in Zaporizhizia, waiting for a phone call telling him to join the convoy for the trip home to care for his elderly mother.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strike-hits-ukrainian-civilian-convoy-near-zaporizhzhia-city"}
