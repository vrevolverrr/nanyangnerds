But at one point, I think we were as low as eight,” Ms Lund told the NTSB.\nIn July, Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for US$4.7 billion (S$6.2 billion) in stock.\nThe hearings are reviewing key issues, including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\nFuselage defects\nMr Jonathan Arnold, aviation safety inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing’s factory was employees not following the instructions.\n“That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,” Mr Arnold said.\nMs Lund said before the Jan 5 accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing had defects – but the key is making sure they are manageable.\n“What we don’t want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,” Ms Lund said. “We were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues, I will tell you, right around the time of the accident.”", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/boeing-to-make-design-changes-to-prevent-future-737-max-9-door-panel-blowout"}
