But he gave his stamp of approval for the formation of the Asia-Pacific Centre for Environmental Law (APCEL) that year.\nFor his foresight, Prof Chin was one of 33 environmentalists lauded by the Good Stories movement during a celebratory event hosted by APCEL at Hotel Jen on July 29. It was the first time that these awards were given out in Singapore.\nProf Chin specialised in criminal, contract and information technology law, but said he recognised the importance of environmental law. “We wanted an area of law that we could develop, and one which would become immensely beneficial and important in the foreseeable future, not just in Singapore but in Asean and globally,” he said.\nSince its inception, APCEL has conducted intensive training programmes for lawyers in the Asia-Pacific region, taught by environmental law professors from all over the world. Research areas include marine plastics pollution, and business and sustainability.\nEnvironmental litigation has taken off in recent times, with lawsuits filed against fossil fuel interests globally and in South-east Asia.\nFor example, in April 2022, 50 representatives from the Omkoi community – an indigenous group from the remote mountains of northern Thailand – filed a lawsuit against the Thai government to oppose a coal mine project by a local mining company, 99 Thuwanon Co. In September that year, the court issued an order for temporary protection of the area, suspending activities of the coal mining project until a final judgment is reached.\nLandmark environmental treaties, including the historic High Seas Treaty, have also provided a legal framework that will pave the way for marine protected areas to be established in international waters, outside any nation’s jurisdiction.\nLaunched in 2022, the Good Stories movement honours individuals, non-governmental organisations and government agencies which have contributed positively to the environment through land, air and water conservation.\nThe movement is led by Filipino attorney Antonio Oposa, who is known for suing the Philippines government 30 years ago to protest against the issuance of logging licences that led to the decline of his country’s old-growth forests. He had done so on behalf of his kindergarten-aged children and unborn grandchildren.\nThe court ruled in his favour and cancelled existing timber licence agreements. His case is taught to law students worldwide, and paved the way for future cases in environmental litigation.\nThe inaugural Singapore edition of the Good Stories movement – previous events were held in Manila, The Hague and New York – aimed to recognise and tell the stories of the pioneer generation of environmental heroes who have contributed to wildlife conservation locally.\nMinister for National Development Desmond Lee, who was guest of honour at the ceremony, said: “These (good) stories do not write themselves. They are not fortuitous events behind the hard work of people who believe strongly and have full conviction in the protection and preservation of our environment and work tirelessly to do so.”\nOthers who were lauded included Dr Andie Ang, president of the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore). She was recognised for her work in studying wild primates in South-east Asia for over 10 years. Dr Ang has worked closely with government and non-government agencies in Singapore and the region for long-term research and conservation of endangered species.\nArchitect and nature conservationist Khew Sin Khoon was also honoured at the ceremony. Known as Singapore’s “butterfly man”, Mr Khew pioneered free-ranging butterfly trails at Alexandra Hospital, Pulau Ubin, Hort Park, and other park connectors and urban gardens.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/law-don-who-championed-setup-of-environmental-law-centre-among-33-awardees-of-inaugural-award"}
