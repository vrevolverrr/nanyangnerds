Poland’s former top diplomat Radoslaw Sikorski is to make a comeback and lead the foreign ministry again.\nThe new government would also include former Polish ombudsman Adam Bodnar, a vocal critic of the previous administration’s judiciary overhaul. Mr Tusk chose him as his justice minister.\nThe confidence vote comes on the heels of the outgoing conservatives’ failure to form a government of their own for lack of viable coalition partners.\nThe right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party won the most seats in October’s general election but failed to win a majority.\n‘Right all of the wrongs’\nStill, PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki was given the first crack at forming a new government and his proposed Cabinet failed to muster enough backing in parliament on Dec 11.\nWhile Mr Tusk’s Civic Coalition came second in the ballot, it secured a majority by joining up with two smaller pro-EU opposition political groups, the Third Way and Left.\nDescribing the right-wing administration as years of “darkness”, Mr Tusk said on Dec 11 that his government would work to “right all of the wrongs”.\nHis arch-nemesis, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, fired back by accusing Mr Tusk of being a “German agent”.\nFreedom hero and Nobel Prize winner Lech Walesa - known for despising the PiS - hailed that Poland was “back on the path of development”.\nBut the next government will face daily battles with the PiS which “will continue to fight”, political analyst Jaroslaw Kuisz told AFP, adding that “there won’t be any miracles.”\nControversial judicial reforms and appointments, which the EU said undermined democratic values, were at the heart of tensions between PiS ministers and Brussels.\nPiS still has a firm ally in Polish President Andrzej Duda, who is due to step down ahead of a presidential election in 2025 but he could use blocking tactics between now and then to veto legislation.
