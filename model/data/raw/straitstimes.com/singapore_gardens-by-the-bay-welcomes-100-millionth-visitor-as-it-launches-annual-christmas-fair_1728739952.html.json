They were given a commemorative gift hamper, a two-year Friends of the Gardens Family Plus membership and a two-night stay at the Garden Pod hotel.\nThe family are frequent visitors, especially to the cooled conservatories. “We love spending family time in Gardens by the Bay. The blend of indoor and outdoor activities is just right for us,” said Mr Er.\nThe self-employed professional, who has been a Friends of the Gardens member since its early days, said: “We believe it’s crucial to expose Joshua and Faith to nature early. The Gardens is perfect for this, especially with the changing floral displays and themes, which introduce them to different cultures.”\nDeputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who was guest of honour at the launch of the Christmas Wonderland fair, wished visitors a merry Christmas.\nHe also greeted young cancer survivors who attended the event. Last week, they and their families lent a hand with the Christmas decorations in the outdoor gardens, under a tie-up with the Children’s Cancer Foundation.\nHe said: “Christmas is also a season of giving, and we are very glad that this year at Gardens, we are able to partner with the Children’s Cancer Foundation, and we can do something for the children and give them some hope as they recover in their various hospitals.”\nChristmas Wonderland, Singapore’s biggest yuletide fair, covering an area of 27,000 sq m – from the Supertree Grove to The Meadow – marks its 10th year in 2023.\nFrom now till Jan 1, 2024, visitors can experience “snow” against the backdrop of a 20m-tall light installation inspired by an Italian castle, and a 24m-long Holly Roger ship with pirate elves.\nVisitors can also enjoy a Walk of Lights tunnel and meet Santa Claus in the Supertree Grove.\nThere will be food and drinks for sale, nightly performances, carnival games and rides such as bumper cars at the fairgrounds.\nA series of free concerts will take place on Dec 16-17 and Dec 22-24 at the Supertrees of the Silver Garden. The audience will be treated to performances by local artistes such as Charlie Lim and Benjamin Kheng, and by community organisations such as the Institute of Technical Education Show Choir and dance school Danz People.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/gardens-by-the-bay-welcomes-100-millionth-visitor-as-it-launches-annual-christmas-fair"}
