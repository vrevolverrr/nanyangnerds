Some examples of endemic diseases here include influenza, dengue, and hand, foot and mouth disease.\nThis is a lower intensity level than a pandemic, which is the current situation as the coronavirus spreads across the world at an unprecedented scale and speed.\nMr Wong said it is \"very likely\" that Covid-19 will never go away.\nHe added that Singapore is currently developing a strategy to deal with Covid-19 being endemic, although it is still too early to paint a full picture of what this may look like.\nHowever, he noted that there will likely be several components to life in this new normal.\nFirst, high vaccination rates will be essential. This means not only getting people here vaccinated with their first and second doses, said Mr Wong, but also probably taking booster shots in the future.\nFor this to happen, Singapore needs a \"proper and comprehensive vaccination programme\", which the authorities are already working out, he added.\nSecond, better medical treatments for Covid-19 may be available. If so, this will give the authorities greater assurance that even if a breakthrough infection were to occur, or in the rare occasion where there are serious illnesses, treatments are available and people can recover, said Mr Wong.\nThird, border restrictions will likely be eased, but more risk-based and targeted precautions will need to be in place, taking into account the overall infection situation in other countries as well as the vaccination status of travellers.\nMr Ong said more focus will be placed on the capabilities Singapore has in suppressing clusters, such as testing and quarantining cases.\nHe added: \"I really hope we have put circuit breakers as a tool behind us, that in the future with capabilities like these, we don't have to resort to big sledgehammer approaches like circuit breakers.\"", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/as-covid-19-becomes-endemic-focus-will-shift-from-daily-covid-19-case-numbers-to"}
