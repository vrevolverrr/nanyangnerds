A total of 40 such coordinators will be trained and deployed across the seven public hospitals by the end of next year.\nBesides these coordinators, employers can also receive subsidies of up to 90 percent, capped at $1,000 per worker, when they have to make adjustments to workplaces to accommodate their injured workers.\nThey can also claim up to $7,000 per worker if they need to hire consultants to evaluate the workers' recovery and assess whether the workplaces need to be modified.\nThese grants are in addition to the $36,000 in medical expenses that can be claimed for each injured worker under the Work Injury Compensation Act.\nA total of 6,132 workers were injured at work in the first six months of this year, down slightly from 6,203 in the same period last year.\nAmong them, 268 suffered major injuries such as burns and fractures.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/more-help-for-workers-injured-on-the-job-to-return-to-work"}
