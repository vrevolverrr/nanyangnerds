Ankara has built schools, hospitals and infrastructure and provided scholarships for Somalis to study in Turkey.\nIn 2017, Turkey opened its biggest overseas military base in Mogadishu. Turkey also provides training to Somali military and police. REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/turkey-to-send-navy-to-somalia-after-agreeing-oil-and-gas-search"}
