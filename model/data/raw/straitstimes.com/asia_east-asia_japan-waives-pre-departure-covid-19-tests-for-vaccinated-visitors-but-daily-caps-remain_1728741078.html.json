No decision has been made yet on a reported plan to raise a daily cap on inbound travellers from 20,000 to 50,000, he added.\n\"We will continue relaxing these measures gradually,\" said Mr Kishida, who addressed reporters online as he is recuperating from Covid-19 at his official residence.\nJapan has maintained some of the strictest pandemic border measures among major economies, requiring travellers to present a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of departure.\nMr Kishida said in May that he wanted to bring Japan's border measures more in line with those of other Group of Seven (G-7) nations.\nJapan in June opened up to tourists for the first time in two years, but requirements that they apply for visas and stick to guided, package tours have kept actual numbers of inbound visitors small.\nAlso, while the testing requirement is being relaxed, there’s still the issue of entry visas.\nJapan's border is currently only open for those with Japanese nationality, as well as long-term and pre-issued tourism visas. Tokyo stopped their visa waivers for applicable passports during the pandemic.\nMr Koji Shibata, chief executive officer of ANA Holdings., welcomed the easing as “good news” that will let people travel abroad with peace of mind.\nBut he said he wanted to see a relaxing of the visa requirements by putting them on the same levels as other G-7 countries.\nAirlines, hotels and retailers are all eager to regain the business they lost.\nThe small trickle of foreigners allowed into Japan last year spent 120 billion yen (S$1.2 billion).\nIn 2019, they spent 4.8 trillion yen, or forty times more, according to the Japan Tourism Agency.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-waives-pre-departure-covid-19-tests-for-vaccinated-visitors-but-daily-caps-remain"}
