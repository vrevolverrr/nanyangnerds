And they are taking over the theme park’s New York Street with more of their kind.\nDance along with a flash mob of these fun-loving yellow creatures. You can also catch them in a stage show Mission: Mega, where they try their best to stop thieves from stealing secret Anti-Villain League tech.\nThe new programmes are part of A Mega Despicable Summer event which runs until Aug 11, in line with Illumination’s Despicable Me 4 animated comedy.\nNow showing in cinemas, the box-office hit introduces laser-blasting Mega Mel, super strong Mega Dave, flying Mega Gus and indestructible Mega Jerry.\nThe new superheroes make their presence felt at the theme park in the form of inflatables towering over New York Street.\nMeanwhile, at the Lagoon Stage, look out for photo opportunities with the Minions’ boss Gru and his family.\nA Mega Despicable Summer is included with regular park admission. Tickets, which come with retail and meal vouchers, are priced from $74 an adult and $59 a child aged four to 12.\nFind out more at www.rwsentosa.com/megasummer and refer to the Universal Studios Singapore app for daily showtimes.\nSingapore Art Museum’s new Learning Gallery\nThere is a new art space to bond over with your kids – and bring out your inner child too.\nSingapore Art Museum’s Learning Gallery at Tanjong Pagar Distripark, which opened on July 20, wants visitors of all ages to approach contemporary art with a childlike perspective.\nThe Learning Gallery features five local and regional artists’ artworks, including one that cannot be seen but has to be heard.\nYou can get up close with Cultural Medallion recipient Han Sai Por’s Black Forest, an installation featuring a destroyed “forest” of charcoal logs which reflects the impact of human activities on the natural world.\nAnother artwork is the award-winning 28-minute short film Like Shadows Through Leaves by Migrant Ecologies Project, a collective which studies culture and nature in South-east Asia.\nIt tells the story of one of Singapore’s oldest housing estates Tanglin Halt, which runs alongside a former railway track, now repurposed as a green corridor.\nEach artwork has accompanying text written separately for children and adults.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/fun-with-kids-minions-at-universal-studios-singapore-singapore-art-museum-s-learning-gallery"}
