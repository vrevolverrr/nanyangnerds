That adds quite a bit of value to our donors and the organisation,” Mr Lai told The Straits Times.\nHe added that using the Don-API service on the free iShine Cloud is much cheaper than using other applications.\nIt also allows multiple users to view donation records simultaneously, he said. “Now, we don’t need to dedicate a certain amount of time just to do these tasks.”\nDonors get tax deductions of 2½ times the qualifying donation amount for donations made to IPCs. These charities must submit records of tax-deductible donations made in the preceding year by Jan 31 annually.\nAround 70 per cent of the more than 700 IPCs in Singapore have adopted donation management software that supports the Don-API service, which allows the software to connect directly with Iras systems.\nThe service has cut the time taken for IPCs to submit donation records to just under five minutes, compared with more than half an hour previously, said Iras.\nIt was progressively rolled out to IPCs from April, and will be the only way for them to submit donation records from Jan 1, 2024.\nThis means that all donation records for 2023 must be submitted to the authority through the digital service.\nIras told ST that 10 digital service providers have integrated the service into their donation management software, with more to come.\nThe initiative started as a pilot in 2022 with two digital service providers – GivePlease and iShine Cloud – making the service available to their IPC clients for submissions in 2023.\nIPCs previously had to submit donation records using two offline applications.\nManually generating records and uploading files across different applications may cause data discrepancies and possible errors, Iras noted.\nIPCs can either integrate their current software with the Don-API service or adopt one where the service has already been integrated.\nThe taxman worked with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and the National Council of Social Service to engage IPCs.\n“This Don-API service was introduced as part of Iras’ efforts to collaborate with partners to develop meaningful digital solutions that integrate tax into taxpayers’ and partners’ natural systems,” it said.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/new-digital-service-streamlines-process-for-charities-to-submit-records-of-tax-deductible-donations"}
