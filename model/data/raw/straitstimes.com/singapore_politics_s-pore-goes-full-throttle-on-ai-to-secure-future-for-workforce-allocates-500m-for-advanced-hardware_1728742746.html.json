The competition is extremely intense,” said Mrs Teo.\nThe ministry provided a breakdown of the $1 billion committed to AI over the next five years, first announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong during Budget 2024 on Feb 16.\nInvestment in talent\nThe investments in academia aim to grow the AI talent pool here, adding to previously announced plans to triple the AI workforce to at least 15,000 over the next five years as detailed in the National AI Strategy 2.0. The strategy was refreshed in December 2023, when DPM Wong detailed Singapore’s plans to become a leader in AI and the need for all industries to become familiar with AI.\nMPs, including Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson) and Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC), had asked how Singapore aims to deepen its expertise in AI and attract world-class talent amid intense competition.\nPart of the budget will be allocated to award a pilot batch of five AI visiting professors over the next five years to drive research here and provide training opportunities for local students.\nTop AI researchers are in high demand internationally and will be critical to help Singapore deepen its expertise and draw in other researchers and companies to work with them, said the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) in a statement. It did not state a budget for the initiative.\nThe experts will be required to spend at least a fifth of their time on the collaboration and identify a Singapore collaborator to anchor their activities here, it added.\nThe Government will invest $7 million into an accelerated master’s programme for AI to build a pipeline of Singaporean research talent and students who are keen on AI research roles or to pursue doctorate programmes.\nThe AI Accelerated Masters Programme, which will halve the period of studies for a Masters by Research degree to one year, is expected to support 50 Singaporeans over the next three years and will open for applications in March.\nOver the next three years, at least $20 million in scholarships will be offered to students studying for their undergraduate, master’s or PhD degrees under the SG Digital Scholarship.\nThe scholarships will target Singaporeans with plans to pursue a career in AI and allow these students to work in the industry after they graduate.\nThe TechSkills Accelerator initiative, which helps to train fresh or mid-career workers keen to work in tech, will also be expanded by working with companies to receive trainees for hands-on experiences.\nMore than 17,000 locals have been trained and placed in the tech sector since 2016, and 231,000 individuals received training under the programme, said MCI.\nMrs Teo said that equipping the workforce with AI skills “may be the best way to forestall AI-induced job displacements, which many members (have) expressed concerns about.”\nShe added: “Many thoughtful observers have, however, pointed out that it is not so much AI displacing workers, but AI-proficient workers displacing AI-deficient workers.”\nSingapore bets on chips\nThe $500 million investment into infrastructure will be channelled to acquire and lease the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) and other computer chips from global vendors, said an MCI spokesman in a media briefing on Feb 22 ahead of the Budget debate.\nSingapore’s ability to support the anticipated wave of AI adoption was among the concerns raised by MPs, including Ms Tin, who said Singapore needs to double down on computational power and speed up network connectivity to meet such demands.\nMore computer chips, like GPUs that support graphics and image processing, will be needed to meet the increasing scale of AI models, MCI said in a fact sheet on its spending plans in 2024.\nThe computer chips will support new AI apps in sectors like transport, logistics, healthcare and financial services, and are aimed at spurring investments from the industry.\n“Done well, this will generate new value beyond productivity moves and experiments and will inform companies’ strategies moving forward,” said MCI. “We recognise that the AI space is fast evolving, and we expect constant advancements in both chip design and compute delivery.”\nMCI added that it plans to lease the chips from external providers that offer AI computational infrastructure as a service, or to acquire and site them within government-owned facilities or those belonging to its research partners.\nIt will provide access to the chips for its partners, with more details to come, said MCI.\nSME support\nSenior Minister of State for Communications and Information Tan Kiat How said the Government will help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) get a leg-up in adopting AI through subsidies, the availability of consultants to provide guidance and other services under the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s SMEs Go Digital programme.\nHe said this in reply to questions from MPs, including Ms Tin, Ms Jessica Tan (East Coast GRC) and Mr Sharael, who asked how the authorities would back SMEs to digitalise and benefit from AI.\nThe authorities will also specify how AI can be applied to each sector as they progressively refresh their series of Industry Digital Plans – digitalisation blueprints for businesses to use as a guide.\nThe plans have been published for 22 sectors, including food services, retail and logistics.\nSMEs can also tap a grant for a list of digital tools, 20 per cent of which are AI-enabled, said Mr Tan, citing how AI can help with data entry and report generation.\nMore than 3,000 SMEs adopted AI-related tools from the list in 2023.\nDigitally advanced enterprises keen to develop their own AI solutions can tap a new initiative dubbed Generative AI X Digital Leaders, which will bring together professionals from other participating tech companies to help build AI tools.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/s-pore-goes-full-throttle-on-ai-to-secure-future-for-workforce-allocates-500m-for-advanced-hardware"}
