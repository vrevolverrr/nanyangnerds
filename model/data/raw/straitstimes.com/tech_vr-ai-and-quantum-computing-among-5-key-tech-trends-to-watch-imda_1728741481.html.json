Dr Janil said an advisory panel that was formed to discuss these matters will publish a blueprint in June to detail steps for industries to take in their digitalisation.\nThese are the five tech trends highlighted:\n1. Virtual reality\nThe $10,000 omnidirectional treadmill, developed by Singapore-based tech start-up StepVR, was among VR technologies presented to the media to highlight the progress of digital products made here.\nThe media was invited to use the treadmill and VR headset to play a Squid Game-inspired video game, which challenges players to hurry across a finish line while stopping each time a gigantic doll turned around.\nInnovations in gaming are often at the forefront of what technology can offer as video games require high processing power and the ability to play with others, said Dr Janil, adding that these developments pave the way for the technology to be used in other sectors.\nThe same software and graphics processors used to make video games have also been used in healthcare training in hospitals here, such as training simulators to prepare surgeons for the operating table.\nMultiplayer interactions that allow groups of users to meet online will also be key to VR’s development in the next decade, said MCI.\n2. Artificial Intelligence\nData centres and other physical infrastructure need to be upgraded to accommodate a rise in AI applications, which need more computing power than usual programmes, said the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).\nIt added: “The increased use of AI will result in more data going the last mile to users as there is a growing need to process and analyse the data in real time to support AI applications.”\nAI programmes have been propelled into the mainstream since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, making sophisticated chatbots accessible to the average user.\n3. Autonomous mobility\nExpect self-driving electric vehicles and more autonomous options for those with disabilities within the next decade.\nHowever, safety protocols will need to improve before autonomous vehicles can be widely adopted. This includes digitising infrastructure to ensure that autonomous vehicles are able to recognise obstacles and drive safely, said IMDA.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/vr-ai-and-quantum-computing-among-5-key-tech-trends-to-watch-imda"}
