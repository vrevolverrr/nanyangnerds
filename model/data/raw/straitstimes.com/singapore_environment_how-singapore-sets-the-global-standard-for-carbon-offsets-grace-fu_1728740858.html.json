And not always for the right reasons, with concerns about whether they really do help reduce emissions.\nYet carbon credits can be a useful tool in tackling climate change. Paying investors for every tonne of carbon emissions they take out of the atmosphere or avoid from being emitted can help developing nations ramp up climate action.\nWhat is needed is tougher standards and more careful vetting of carbon offset projects. And Singapore, which is positioning itself as a global hub for carbon offset trading and project financing, is helping drive efforts to boost the quality and integrity of carbon offsets.\nFor instance, the government recently announced the eligibility criteria for carbon offsets that can be used by big polluters under the nation’s carbon tax regime.\nIn this episode, ST’s climate editor David Fogarty hosts Singapore’s Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, to find out more about this.\nHighlights (click/tap above):\n1:05 Why are carbon credits a useful tool and how can they help Singapore meet its climate targets?\n5:26 Yet concerns remain about carbon offsets. Why is that?\n9:59 What are the new eligibility criteria for offsets that can be used in Singapore’s carbon tax regime?\n15:03 How will carbon offsets used by firms in Singapore be vetted?\n19:37 What are corresponding adjustments?\n24:05 Will the 5 per cent offset cap in the carbon tax scheme be increased?\nProduced by: David Fogarty (dfogarty@sph.com.sg), Ernest Luis, Hadyu Rahim & Amirul Karim\nEdited by: Hadyu Rahim\nFollow Green Pulse Podcast here and rate us:\nChannel: https://str.sg/JWaf\nApple Podcasts: https://str.sg/JWaY\nSpotify: https://str.sg/JWag\nWebsite: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\nFeedback to: podcast@sph.com.sg\nFollow David Fogarty on X: https://str.sg/JLM6\nRead his articles: https://str.sg/JLMu\n---\nDiscover more ST podcast channels:\nCOE Watch: https://str.sg/iTtE\nIn Your Opinion: https://str.sg/w7Qt\nAsian Insider: https://str.sg/JWa7\nHealth Check: https://str.sg/JWaN\nGreen Pulse: https://str.sg/JWaf\nYour Money & Career: https://str.sg/wB2m\nST Sports Talk: https://str.sg/JWRE\n#PopVultures: https://str.sg/JWad\nMusic Lab: https://str.sg/w9TX\nDiscover ST Podcasts: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\n---\nSpecial edition series:\nTrue Crimes Of Asia (new): https://str.sg/i44T\nThe Unsolved Mysteries of South-east Asia (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuZ2\nInvisible Asia (9 eps): https://str.sg/wuZn\nStop Scams (10 eps): https://str.sg/wuZB\nSingapore’s War On Covid (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuJa\n---\nFollow our shows then, if you like short, practical podcasts!", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/how-singapore-sets-the-global-standard-for-carbon-offsets-grace-fu"}
