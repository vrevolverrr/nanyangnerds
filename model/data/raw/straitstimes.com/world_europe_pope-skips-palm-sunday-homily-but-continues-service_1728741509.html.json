But on March 24, his prepared text was not read at all.\nIt is very unusual for a Pope to totally skip a homily at a major event such as Palm Sunday.\nThe Vatican gave no immediate explanation for why the Pope skipped the homily. The television coverage showed only the crowd for a few minutes, instead of a close up of the Pope.\nAn announcer on Vatican Radio then said the Pope had decided to not read the homily. The Pope, dressed in red vestments, continued presiding, reading parts of the mass.\nCardinals, priests and bishops took part in the service that commemorates what the Bible says was Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem days before he was betrayed, put on trial and executed by crucifixion.\nThey, along with participants in the crowd, held palm fronds and olive branches at the service, which marks the start of Holy Week, a busy period leading to Easter.\nBecause of his knee ailment, for more than a year Pope Francis has been presiding at masses while sitting near the altar while a cardinal acts as the main celebrant.\nAfter the mass, Pope Francis delivered his weekly Sunday Angelus message and blessing from the altar and not from the window of the Apostolic Palace overlooking the square. That is not unusual on major occasions.\nIn the prayer, he condemned the shooting attack that killed at least 133 people at a concert hall near Moscow as a vile and inhuman act that offends God.\nHe again asked for prayers for all those suffering from wars, mentioning Ukraine and Gaza.\nAt the end of the service, Pope Francis was driven around the square in an open-top vehicle. He waved and smiled at people in the crowd and did not appear to be any difficulty. REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/pope-skips-palm-sunday-homily-but-continues-service"}
