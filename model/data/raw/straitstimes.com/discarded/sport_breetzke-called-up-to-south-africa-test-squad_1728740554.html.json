We have therefore selected our strongest possible squad and look forward to strong performances in the Caribbean.\"\nSouth Africa meet West Indies in the first test at Queen’s Park Oval in Trinidad and Tobago from Aug. 7-11 and then travel to Guyana for the second test in Georgetown from Aug. 15-19.\nSquad:\nTemba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Matthew Breetzke, Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Tony de Zorzi, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Dane Paterson, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Tristan Stubbs, Ryan Rickelton, Kyle Verreynne.
