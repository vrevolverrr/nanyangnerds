The 354 runs scored by both are also the most by openers in an innings in women's Tests.\nShafali scored the double century off just 194 balls. The 20-year-old surpassed Annabel Sutherland's earlier performance this year, where the Australian scored a century off 248 balls against the Proteas.\nThe previous record for the most runs scored in a single day was set by England's Betty Snowball, who amassed 189 runs on the opening day of a test match against New Zealand in 1935.\nShafali is the second Indian woman as well as the second youngest woman to record a double-century in test matches, following India's Mithali Raj who was 19 when she scored 214 runs against England in Taunton in 2002.
