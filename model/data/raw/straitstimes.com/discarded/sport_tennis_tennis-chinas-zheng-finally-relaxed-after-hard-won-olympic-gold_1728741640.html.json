Mentally I feel a lot lighter going forward,\" she told reporters.\n\"Finally, I am able to say to my family, to say to my father, 'come on, I just made history!',\" a beaming Zheng said.\nHer Olympic journey was not all smooth sailing as she had to endure two hard-fought three-set battles that lasted three hours, including a victory over former world number one Angelique Kerber, before knocking out current number one Iga Swiatek in the semi-final.\n\"It's the first time I've had to fight five matches in a row,\" she said. \"My body was in pain after the third match and I had to play with bandages. It was not easy to keep carrying on.\n\"I really think I've fought long and hard on the courts and I've pushed myself to the limit,\" she added.\nZheng's gold medal adds to the most successful year of her career after she reached the final of the Australian Open in January, the second Chinese finalist after Li Na in 2014.\nHer Olympic victory also answered critics who had questioned her stability and mental strength after a series of defeats since the Australian Open including a first-round exit at Wimbledon in July.\n\"This time when I stood on the clay court, I learned my lesson. I played right and I was calmer and had more patience,\" Zheng said. \"I was able to win because of such calmness and patience.\"\nZheng, currently ranked number seven in the world, was the second Chinese player to reach an Olympic singles semi-final after Li Na, who finished in fourth place at Beijing 2008.\nLi, from Zheng's hometown Hubei province in central China, is considered by far the most successful tennis player in Asia, having achieved a career-high WTA ranking of number two and won nine singles titles including two Grand Slam titles at the 2011 French Open and 2014 Australian Open.\nZheng said Li was her childhood hero and she wished to be inspiration to young kids as well.\n\"Winning a Grand Slam is also one of my dreams. It's hard to compare because each era has its own heroes and Na was one in her era,\" she said. \"I hope to be able to work hard and achieve my limits and be a better player.\"\nZheng said she shut off all her communication channels during the Olympics and was watching videos of Chinese athletes winning Olympic events to encourage herself.\n\"I've watched Liu Xiang's victory at the Athens Games in 2004 (in 110 metres hurdles) many times, trying to inspire myself,\" she said. \"He was 21 and I am the same age today. I felt I could do it too.\"\nHappy to be back in the real world, she said she was looking forward to soaking up some of the Games atmosphere.\n\"I might go take a look in the Olympic Village and see if I can get some pins.\" REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/tennis-chinas-zheng-finally-relaxed-after-hard-won-olympic-gold"}
