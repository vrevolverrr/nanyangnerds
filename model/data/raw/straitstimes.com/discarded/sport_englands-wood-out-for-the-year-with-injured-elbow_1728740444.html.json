I'm especially surprised because I've been playing test cricket and kept my speeds up.\"\nWood, who has taken 119 wickets in 37 tests, will miss England's test tours of Pakistan in October and New Zealand in December, the ECB said in a statement.\n\"He aims to return to full fitness by early 2025, in time for Englandâ€™s white-ball tour of India and the ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan, scheduled to begin in February 2025,\" the ECB added.\nWood, 34, said he had been down this path before.\n\"See you for some rockets in 2025,\" he wrote.
