Mostly we stay in the hotel. No one wants to run into trouble and get beaten up.\n\"We've asked the board to try and ask for some security for us until the main team arrives, but we haven't heard anything back yet.\"\nSri Lanka team manager Mahinda Halangoda said he raised the security issues with the ECB after reading reports of unrest in Manchester, where the first test is scheduled.\n\"I raised the issue with them, and the ECB responded very quickly and sent us their comprehensive security arrangements,\" Halangoda told ESPNcricinfo.\n\"We'll be having a security liaison on the tour from them as well.\"\nIn 2022, Sri Lanka were in a similar position to England today, when Australia and Pakistan raised ethical concerns over touring the crisis-hit island nation for a bilateral series.\nThe political unrest also shifted that year's Asia Cup to the United Arab Emirates.\nSri Lanka will begin their three-match test series against England on Aug. 21 at Old Trafford.
