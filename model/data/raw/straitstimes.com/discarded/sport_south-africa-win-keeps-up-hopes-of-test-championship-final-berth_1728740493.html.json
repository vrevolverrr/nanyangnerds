And I think along the way as well, we've played some good cricket,” Bavuma said.\n“We were put under pressure, and we were able to have answers in those periods. I think we can obviously get better and improve, but I think for this young group of players, there's a lot of learnings and confidence that we can take from here,” he told reporters.
