I couldn't be happier,\" Manassero said.\n\"It's a target golf course and if you put yourself in position and hit some good irons then (low) scoring is really possible,\" he added.\nManassero, who won his first European Tour event aged 17 and still holds the record for the youngest victor, is back on the tour after a five year absence having qualified again through last year's Challenge Tour.\nBekker hit a second successive 65, which included 10 birdies and three bogeys.\nHidalgo and McKibbin both carded eight-under 64s while Cantero hit two eagles in his 67, but bogeyed the second last hole.
