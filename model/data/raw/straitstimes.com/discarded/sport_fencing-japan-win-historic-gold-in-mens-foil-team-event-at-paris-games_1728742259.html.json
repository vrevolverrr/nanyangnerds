We were focused in every moment, in every match.\"\nThe bout was tight, with Japan leading at first, then Italy, until Iimura scored seven decisive touches against Filippo Macchi, silver medallist in the individual event.\nThen substitute Yudai Nagano who fenced a flawless round, scored five touches against Italy's Alessio Foconi to give Japan a comfortable lead of six touches.\nIt was Japan's fifth fencing medal overall and their second gold in Paris, putting them at the top of the medal table for the discipline, after Koki Kano won the individual title in the men's epee on Aug 1.\nThey won the silver medal in the same event at the London Games in 2012 and have now won eight medals overall in Olympic fencing.\nJapan's foil coaches, Frenchmen Erwann Le Pechoux and Franck Boidin, said earlier in the day that the country had a successful strategy to foster fencing talents, bringing in expertise from abroad in recent years.\n\"Honestly I don't realise yet what the boys have done, I was proud and happy to see them win, but I don't yet fully realise what they've achieved,\" Le Pechoux told reporters.\nJapan cruised through the quarter-finals, beating Canada 45-26, and went on to eliminate local favourites France 45-37 in the semi-finals.\nFrance had qualified for the semi-finals in a dramatic 45-35 win, after the bout was brought to a standstill for a while as China's Mo Ziwei sustained a shock that doctors worried might be a concussion.\nAfter their loss to Japan, France went on to win the bronze medal bout against the United States. Lead at first, Enzo Lefort turned the tide, scoring eight touches against Nick Itkin, bronze medallist in the individual event.\nThe medal was France's 44th in Paris, topping the 43 the country won at the Beijing Games in 2008. France took more medals at the 1900 Paris Olympics, but only 27 countries and a fraction of the number of athletes participated compared with recent Games.\n\"It's not the medal of only four guys. It's the medal of all a population,\" Lefort told reporters.\n\"We're happy. We have done our job, and we'll be able to join the party.\" REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/fencing-japan-win-historic-gold-in-mens-foil-team-event-at-paris-games"}
