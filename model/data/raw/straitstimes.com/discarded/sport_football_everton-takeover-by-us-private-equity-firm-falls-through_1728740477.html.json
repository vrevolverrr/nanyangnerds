By January 2022, he had increased his stake to 94.1% with a 100-million-pound ($130-million) capital injection.\nBut despite investing nearly 750 million euros ($810 million) in transfers to build the squad since Moshiri's arrival, Everton have slipped out of the top half of the table to fight relegation battles in recent seasons.\nThe club finished 15th in the Premier League after being hit with two separate points deductions for breaching profit and sustainability rules.\nEverton are now free to talk to other interested investors, with the BBC reporting that Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor, who is looking to sell his majority stake in the London club, would consider Everton as an opportunity.\n\"The club will continue to operate as usual, while it works with Blue Heaven Holdings to assess all options for the clubâ€™s future ownership,\" Everton said.
