I’m grateful to him for keeping that promise and I want to thank Kim Jung-hwan and Kim Jun-ho for working hard with me. I also dedicate my individual silver medal to my wife and my gold to my baby son.”\nApart from the men’s team sabre and individual golds, the South Koreans also won the women’s epee individual, women’s sabre individual, men’s team foil and women’s team epee.\nIn gymnastics, Lee, who took the pommel horse silver at the Tokyo Olympics behind Britain’s Max Whitlock, pipped Japan’s Ryota Tsumura for the gold at the Huanglong Sports Centre Gymnasium with a score of 15.50.\n“I was so nervous, I was really stressed before my turn,” the “prince of the pommel horse” said, adding that he very much wanted to retain his crown.\nElsewhere on Thursday, Chinese tennis player Zheng Qinwen, fresh off her dream run to the US Open quarter-finals, was guaranteed at least a silver medal after prevailing 6-1, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in a tough semi-final against the Philippines’ Alexandra Eala. She will meet compatriot Zhu Lin in the final.\nThe traditional Chinese martial art of wushu has been a convenient way for the hosts to rack up medals at past Asian Games – and so it has proved again in Hangzhou. Team China finished with 11 out of 15 of the competition’s golds, seven decided on a helter-skelter final day.\nIran, the most enthusiastic wushu nation outside of China, lost three out of three gold-medal deciders to the hosts on Thursday. They included an especially bitter defeat for women’s 52-kg fighter Elaheh Mansoryan Samiroumi, now runner-up at three consecutive Games.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/basketball/games-south-koreas-avengers-claim-another-asian-games-fencing-gold"}
