Some honest conversations this week and hopefully, a response... that internal reflection can be really healthy.”\nHe wants his side to show courage on the ball when going forward.\n“We have to carry a threat. We have to be an attacking force, brave with the ball as well,” he said.\nThe manager said it was possible for Isak, who suffered a broken toe earlier in September, to play with the injury, but the Sweden international was a doubt for City.\n“It’s one that can be managed and played with (provided) he can tolerate the pain levels, and that will have no long-term risks... let’s see how he is today,” he added.\nAside from Isak, the Magpies are also missing defenders Sven Botman and Jamaal Lascelles, midfielder Lewis Miley and forward Callum Wilson through injury. Fullback Matt Targett is a doubt.\nHowe said that Newcastle, who have 10 points from five matches, three behind leaders City, will do their best to make things difficult for the champions.\n“Everyone will be highly motivated for the match, the crowd will be really there for us if we can inspire them,” he added.\nThe game will be City’s first league game since midfielder Rodri suffered knee ligament damage during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Sept 22.\nThe Spaniard has become indispensable to Pep Guardiola’s team and is widely considered the best player in his position in the world.\nThe 28-year-old, one of the leading contenders to win the prestigious Ballon d’Or award, is out for this campaign in a major blow to City’s hopes of winning the Premier League title for a record-extending fifth successive season.\nCity have not lost any of the last 48 league games in which Rodri has featured, with their three top-flight defeats in the 2023-24 season all coming in his absence.\n“Surgery this morning, ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) and next season he will be here. This season is over,” Guardiola said on Sept 27.\n“Unfortunately we got the worst, but these things happen. We will be there to support him in his recovery step by step.\n“If we don’t win, then it is because of Rodri. We are stronger with him and stronger with (Nathan) Ake and (Oscar) Bobb and Kevin (de Bruyne) but that is what it is. We don’t want it, but it is football.”\nDe Bruyne is an injury doubt for the Newcastle game, while long-term absentees Bobb and Ake remain unavailable.\nDespite an underwhelming start to his City career since joining from Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2023, Matheus Nunes believes he can help fill the void left by a long-term injury to fellow midfielder Rodri.\nThe 26-year-old Portuguese, who has been a bit-part player at City so far, said: “At Wolves I played more as a winger and last year here I played more as a (No.) 10 but when I played for Sporting (Lisbon), I always played in the double pivot, so I’m used to every position now.\n“I try to help the team every time the coach puts me on the field, but I know the other guys are all ready as well because we have so much quality in the team.” REUTERS, AFP", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/eddie-howe-demands-newcastle-united-response-after-fulham-loss-led-to-honest-conversations"}
