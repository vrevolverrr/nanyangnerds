So history is repeating itself and the legacy for the family in the sport continues.”\nAsked what he told his daughter before the event, he said: “I did not speak to her. She asked me not to call her the day before her event. We have talked about other things but not about her competition. She did well today, actually, the entire Indian team did well because one of the girls (Wu) shot 124 out of 125, which was better than that in the men’s trap,” said Singh.\n“She has her own team of coaches and sports psychologists. Nowadays, the younger generation likes to do things their own way. Also, shooting has changed a lot from my time.”\nIn roller skating, where athletes fly round an oval-shaped track on inline skates in a venue akin to a velodrome or an ice speed skating arena, South Korea’s men secured a one-two in the 1,000m final with Chinese Taipei bagging the bronze.\nIn the women’s race, South Korea got the bronze and Chinese Taipei registered the one-two.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/games-skorea-beat-china-for-badminton-gold-but-hosts-gain-shooting-world-record"}
