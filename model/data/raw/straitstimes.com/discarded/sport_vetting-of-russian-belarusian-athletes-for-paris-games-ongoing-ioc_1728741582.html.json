The reason it is taking so long is we are doing it very, very thoroughly.\"\n\"We need to get the information from a lot of people. So the process has to be done properly.\"\nThe IOC has said it expects to see about 36 Russian and 22 Belarusian athletes competing as neutrals in Paris.\nThe maximum number, depending on qualification standards and country quotas, and which is unlikely to be reached, would be 54 and 28 respectively.\n\"You can imagine the amount of work required to go through a full and through process,\" said IOC sports director Kit McConnell.\n\"That includes review of contracting situations, social media and so on.\"\n\"In terms of timelines we are conscious of confirming the places available. We are working with international federations and trying to do that as quickly as possible... but obviously in a very thorough way.\"\nThe Paris Olympics kick off on July 26.
