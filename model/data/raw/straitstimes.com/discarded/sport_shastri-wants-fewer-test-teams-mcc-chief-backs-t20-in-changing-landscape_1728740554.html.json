Bring it down to six or seven and have promotion and relegation system.\n\"You can have two tiers but let the top six keep playing to sustain the interest in Test cricket.\n\"You can spread the game in other formats, like T20,\" added the former India coach.\nFormer Australia batter and coach Justin Langer said while he loved T20 leagues, he wanted international cricket to be protected for the impact in can have on young people.\nHe cited examples including West Indies fast bowler Shamar Joseph's memorial debut series in Australia this year.\n\"...it had Australia enthralled and it brought the Caribbean to life,\" Langer said.\n\"Last week we saw a million people turn up to see India celebrated for winning the World Cup.\n\"That is bilateral cricket and international cricket.\"\nSumming up the themes, MCC President Mark Nicholas said the views were not to suggest test cricket was unwarranted, and that cricket needed money to sustain itself.\n\"T20 cricket is the behemoth that everybody wants,\" he said.\n\"It is where the new market is, where the fans are and where the money is.\n\"In cricket, money is seen as a dirty word but it shouldn't be because it is the only way to sustain the game.\" REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/shastri-wants-fewer-test-teams-mcc-chief-backs-t20-in-changing-landscape"}
