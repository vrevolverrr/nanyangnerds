We are very good friends with each other and long time playing together in the same team. So he obviously meant a lot for table tennis in the whole world. We are losing a legend, but he is not going to be forgotten,\" said Kallberg.\nHis teammate at the Olympics and once rival Dimitrij Ovtcharov said he was impressed by how Boll handles losses.\n\"Iâ€™ve rarely met athletes who can so quickly process a loss or a win and then return to normal life. Timo is not only a great table tennis player but also a very good person,\" said Ovtcharov.\nBoll made his Olympic debut in Sydney in 2000, wining silver in the team event at Beijing 2008 and Tokyo 2020 and bronze in London 2012 and Rio 2016. His best Olympic singles performance came in Athens in 2004 when he reached the quarter-finals.\nHe was given a standing ovation from the crowd on Tuesday, which included NBA great Dirk Nowitzki.\nFor over two decades, he managed to stay among the top players in the world.\n\"I'm able to be resilient against everything, against the changes we had in the past. But finally, you feel that your body is slow and it's getting harder and harder to keep the level so high. So I think it was the right moment,\" said Boll, who plans to spend more time with his family in his post-competition life.
