Since Tokyo, we’ve both believed we could win this race. It’s been a slow build, but to be here and finally do it in front of them, I can’t believe it.”\nRomania went out fast in the men’s double sculls final but were quickly reined in by a strong Dutch crew, who took the lead around the midway point of the race and looked strong before being pulled back themselves.\nDespite looking spent, the Romanians came roaring back to take the lead again, leaving their closest rivals in a furious battle for second place with the resurgent Ireland crew, who ultimately had to be content with bronze.\nAfter a fourth place and one silver in the opening two races, the Netherlands finally made the top step of the podium in the women’s four final after a thrilling showdown with the British crew that saw them finish 0.18sec in front to grab gold. The Kiwis took bronze.\nThe day’s racing ended with the men’s four final, which the United States dominated almost from the start, brushing off a late challenge from New Zealand to finish in 5:49.03 for gold. Britain finished third.\nElsewhere, China’s Liu Yukun won gold in the men’s 50m rifle three positions before confidently proclaiming that he was probably a “genius” when it came to shooting.\nThe 27-year-old has been in sensational form in 2024, breaking the world record twice in two days at the Baku World Cup in May and he also topped qualification on July 31.\nHe racked up 463.6 points to win gold ahead of Ukraine’s Serhiy Kulish (461.3).\nLiu said his dream Olympic debut was a collective effort by his team but when asked if he considered himself a genius, the shooter paused before answering: “Probably I am.”\nMeanwhile, the men and women’s 20km walk races kicked off the athletics programme.\nItaly’s Massimo Stano was bidding to become the first man to win back-to-back gold in the event after triumphing in Tokyo but he was beaten into an agonising fourth place, with Brian Pintado from Ecuador taking gold. It was Ecuador’s second Olympic title in the event, after Jefferson Perez in 1996.\nIn the women’s race, China’s Yang Jiayu produced a dominant performance to take gold, the fourth Chinese winner in the seven times the event has featured at the Olympics.\nThe men’s skiff medal race was abandoned after sailing officials decided that there was not enough wind to complete the 10-boat race. There was no immediate indication when the deciding race in the series would be rescheduled.\nThe women’s race, which was due to be held after the men’s, was also postponed.\nMeanwhile, reigning champions South Korea left almost no room for suspense in the men’s sabre team fencing event, beating Hungary and winning their third consecutive title. Already crowned on July 27 in the individual event, Oh Sang-uk delivered the coup de grace in a 45-41 win against the 2023 world champions.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/new-zealand-sculls-pair-lead-rowing-gold-rush-at-paris-games"}
