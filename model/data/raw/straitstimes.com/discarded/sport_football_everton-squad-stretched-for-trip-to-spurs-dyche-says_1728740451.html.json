We are in a better position because of player trading and how much we have lowered the wages but it is not solved,\" said Dyche.\nEverton managed to escape relegation last season despite having points deducted twice for breaching the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR).\nEverton's takeover agreement with prospective owner 777 Partners expired in June while the Friedkin Group abandoned its plans to purchase a majority stake in the club last month.\nEverton were beaten 3-0 at home by Brighton & Hove Albion in their Premier League opener.
