But the celebrations, and a delighted smile, would come later when she realised she had won the final to add a sixth Paralympic gold to her collection.\nThe 32-year-old narrowly edged Aceves, clocking 2min 21.73sec to finish just 0.06sec ahead of the Mexican and retain her title.\nItaly’s Angela Procida touched the wall in 2:24.48 to claim the bronze.\nYip said after the race: “It was so close that when I came up, touched the wall and saw the two beside me also touched the wall, I was like ‘oh no, what’s this?’\n“This time our game plan going in was to focus on our own race, have a plan for the first 50m, and then back.\n“I’ve been trained throughout the years not to look at the people around me to really focus on what I can do and keep the energy there.”\nYip is aiming for a special three-peat of back-to-back golds in the 50m and 100m S2 back after claiming both titles at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020.\nThe heats for the S2 50m backstroke are on Aug 31.\nYip, Singapore’s most decorated Paralympian, now has six golds and a silver across five editions of the Games, having won her maiden title in her debut at the Beijing Games in 2008.\nShe added: “It’s been what feels like a long journey, but actually the shortest, because it was three years (of training). I feel as I grew older, I grew emotional as you realise the greatness of things, the occasion.\n“Coming into the 100m, it’s like my pet event, to get this most important one, it’s like a weight lifted, so whatever comes, comes. I don’t think that I have it in mind that I’m constantly at the top and being chased after, but what keeps me working hard is just really wanting to be better than I was.”\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, who is in Paris for the Games, said in a Facebook post: “Congrats to Pin Xiu! 3 Golds in a row, PX’s resilience, grit and determination is nothing short of remarkable and breathtaking. So proud of you, PX!”\nIn the women’s individual compound open ranking, archer Nur Syahidah Alim shot a season-best 677 points in 12 rounds to finish 11th out of 28. She secured a spot in the round of 16 on Aug 30, when she will face Australia’s Ameera Lee at 9.51am (3.51pm, Singapore time).\nTokyo 2020 silver medallist Oznur Cure of Turkey shot a world record score of 704 to finish first, while India’s Asian Para Games gold medallist Sheetal Devi (703) was second.\nMeanwhile, shooter Daniel Chan, who is making his Paralympic debut, will be competing in the men’s 10m air pistol SH1 qualification at 11.15am (5.15pm, Singapore time) on Aug 30.\nIn boccia’s BC1 preliminary round pool B, Singapore’s Jeralyn Tan beat France’s Aurelie Aubert 6-1 and will face Spain’s Amagoia Arreita next on Aug 31.\nSix other athletes are representing the Republic at the 2024 Paris Paralympics from Aug 28 to Sept 8 – Toh Wei Soong and Sophie Soon (swimming), Diroy Noordin (athletics), Laurentia Tan, Gemma Foo and Hilary Su (equestrian).", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/singapore-swimmer-yip-pin-xiu-wins-s2-100m-backstroke-gold-at-paralympics"}
