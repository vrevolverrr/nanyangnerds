Interestingly, the island’s cultural hub, Ubud, located among the central hills of the island is, in contrast, experiencing a slight thinning of crowds – in a good way.\nOn a recent return trip to Ubud, my first since the pandemic, I observed that it was significantly less crowded compared with its heyday some years ago. Some locals attribute this to the digital nomads migrating to Canggu, now that things have opened up.\nWhatever the reason, the streets were indeed less packed with traffic and a lot easier to navigate on foot, although it is advisable to keep an eye out for scooters whizzing by. So, this is an ideal time to be immersed in the town’s heritage, whether it is visiting the Ubud palace or attending the yoga or meditation classes that the destination is famous for.\nFor those who seek material pleasures, there are multiple clothing, homeware and curio stores lining the narrow streets; as well as a cornucopia of Bali’s most popular restaurants, including Locavore, Mozaic and Honey & Smoke, to dine at.\nFor my two-night stay, I chose The Villas at Bisma Eight, the latest extension to boutique hotel Bisma Eight, for its unbeatable central location.\nCo-founded by Mr Suraj Melwani, a Singapore permanent resident who owns clothing brand Sifr and who previously launched a fashion boutique in Singapore, the property is located in Jalan Bisma, a quieter street just a stone’s throw from the town’s main activity hub.\nThe original hotel, also situated along this street, features a modern Balinese design ethos that generously incorporates locally sourced materials, such as timber and terracotta. This philosophy is echoed in The Villas, which launched in 2019, shortly before the pandemic brought global travel to a standstill.\nThe 12-key property comprises one- and two-bedroom villas, for those who need more space compared with a boutique hotel room. They are set around a tranquil courtyard and organic garden, providing respite from the hustle and bustle of town.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/life/travel/suite-life-balinese-respite-in-villa-created-for-indoor-outdoor-living"}
