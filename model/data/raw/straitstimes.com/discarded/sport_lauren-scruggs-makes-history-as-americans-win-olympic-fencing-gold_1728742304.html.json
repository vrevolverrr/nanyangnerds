She beat Singapore’s Amita Berthier in the table of 32.\n“Fencing has largely, historically, been a non-black sport,” she had said previously.\n“So I hope to inspire young black girls to get into fencing and to think that they can have a place in the sport. I just hope that more people who look like me, little girls like me, feel they have a place in the sport.”\nScruggs was around seven when she started fencing. She was inspired by her older brother, Nolen, who was eager to try fencing after watching Star Wars, she told TV programme Good Morning America.\n“As the younger sibling, I always wanted to do whatever he did, so I started fencing, and I stuck with it,” she said.\nScruggs clung to the sport’s competitive nature, telling Good Morning America that it channelled her creativity. But as a black fencer, she felt added pressure whenever she stepped onto the piste.\n“Growing up in fencing, no one really looked like me,” she said in the interview.\n“I think in order to prove myself, I really had to be the best at the tournaments.”\nShe kept winning those tournaments. Scruggs was then accepted into the Peter Westbrook Foundation, an organisation founded by Peter Westbrook, the first black American man to win an Olympic fencing medal at Los Angeles 1984.\nThe organisation supports young fencers from under-represented racial and economic backgrounds. Scruggs, who now volunteers as a mentor for the foundation, eventually wants to own her own fencing club, she said.\nA rising senior at Harvard University, she has won six age-group world championships titles and is the youngest American foil fencer to win the Junior World Championship, according to her bio.\nShe was also the 2023 NCAA national champion.\nScruggs was No. 11 in the International Fencing Federation’s world rankings when she arrived in Paris, an impressive feat considering her circumstances.\n“I think my success in fencing has also helped break stereotypes about what black people can do and who can be a fencer,” she added in the Good Morning America interview.\nBack in Paris, Italy’s coach Stefano Cerioni was happy with silver and paid tribute to the US. “My team did great, the Americans just did better,” he added.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/lauren-scruggs-makes-history-as-americans-win-olympic-fencing-gold"}
