However, he died in 1962.\nJuve was 10 years younger. He won a bronze medal at the 1936 Olympics – beating Germany en route in front of Adolf Hitler – and banged in 33 goals in 45 games, making him Norway’s all-time leading scorer, two ahead of Haaland. Juve died in 1983.\n“I started to wonder. These were the names that were read out and they were serious. They’ve probably taken the list of top scorers and added a few names,” said a laughing Solbakken.\nAnti-doping Norway struggled to explain what might have caused the mix-up. “It’s hard to say what happened,” communications director, Halvor Byfuglien, told the VG newspaper. “All we can do now is admit we’re wrong. We can joke about it in the office today and then review our routines going forward.”\nNorway are away to Kazakhstan on Sept 6, before hosting Austria three days later.
