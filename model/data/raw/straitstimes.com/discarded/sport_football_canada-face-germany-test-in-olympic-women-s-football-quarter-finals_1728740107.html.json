The chances were stacked against us but we pulled through,” defender Vanessa Gilles, the match-winner against France and Colombia, told Canada’s CBC.\n“We still believe the sanction was unfair, unjust and unprecedented.”\nGermany lost 4-1 to the US in the group stage but went through with wins against Australia and Zambia, and Horst Hrubesch’s team may be a step up on anything Canada have faced yet.\nThe Americans, targeting a record-extending fifth women’s football gold, meet Japan in Paris in a repeat of the London 2012 final, which they won 2-1.\nUnder new coach Emma Hayes, the US won all three group games, with their attacking trio of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith all impressing.\n“Honestly, we are kind of like sisters. This group we have right now is special and we are having a lot of fun,” said Swanson.\nThe teams also met in the World Cup finals of 2011 and 2015, with one victory apiece, and Japan will be confident they can compete with the traditional powerhouse of the women’s game.\nSpain, meanwhile, will take some stopping after the world champions eased through to the last eight also with a 100 per cent record in Group C.\nA side led by Ballon d’Or Feminin winner Aitana Bonmati will be strong favourites in Lyon against Colombia, who progressed as one of the best third-placed teams.\nHowever, Alexia Putellas warned her teammates not to take the South Americans lightly.\n“It’s going to be difficult to win every game,” she said, explaining that teams are setting up defensively against Spain.\n“We’ve struggled to find our rhythm at times. Brazil, for example, really managed to stifle our attacks.”\nThe Brazilians were handicapped against Spain – a 2-0 defeat for the South Americans – by the sending-off of captain Marta, one of the greats of the women’s game.\nNow suspended, the 38-year-old’s chances of featuring again at her sixth Olympics hinge on them beating France in Nantes.\nHerve Renard’s French team were not always convincing in the group stage but boast a lethal striker in Marie-Antoinette Katoto, the tournament’s leading scorer with five goals. “Marie carries the team because she is so clinical,” said the coach. “She doesn’t need many chances to score.”\nFrance or Brazil will meet Spain or Colombia in the semi-finals, with the US or Japan facing Canada or Germany.
