Moscow had a contract with Iran for a total of 1,750, Gen Skibitsky said, adding that a new batch of perhaps as many as 300 drones was now arriving as part of that contract.\nAmerican officials have said that they are aware of reports that Russia and Iran are trying to set up a joint production facility for drones in Russia.\nRussia’s goal is to use swarms of drones in such large numbers that they overwhelm Ukraine’s air defences, allowing some to get through to their targets, Gen Skibitsky said.\nIn the recent attacks, he added, so many drones were fired that Ukraine’s National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems – advanced air defence systems produced by the United States and Norway – had to be reloaded with missiles while the raids were ongoing, the first time that has happened in the war.\n“If there are a very large number of drones in a particular direction, then they can simply break through the air defence system in that area,” he said.
