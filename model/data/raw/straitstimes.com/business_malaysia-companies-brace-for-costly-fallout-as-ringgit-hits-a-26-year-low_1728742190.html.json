Those of us in the services sector that import materials and products will lose even more.”\nThe weak ringgit could add strain to Malaysia Airlines, still recovering from restructuring its debt in 2021, as well as budget carrier AirAsia.\n“The airline sector is the most exposed to risks due to currency mismatch in operations,” said Mr Xavier Jean, senior director for corporate ratings at S&P in Singapore.\nHe added that the airlines have expenses, including fuel and leases, in US dollars and revenue in ringgit.\n“Debt in these companies is often denominated in dollars,” he said. “They have the double whammy of operating and financial exposure to currency depreciation.”\nMalaysia Airlines declined to comment about the impact of the currency weakness on the company’s bottom line.\nAirAsia Group chief executive officer Tony Fernandes said he is not concerned about the ringgit “as it is mostly sentiment”.\nWhile 70 per cent of the carrier’s costs are paid in US dollars, “we have good ancillary income and fares are strong”, helping to buffer the company against the weak local currency, he said.\nConstruction companies that depend on imported raw materials, as well as telecommunication firms, whose capital spending is in dollars, also face a financial fallout, S&P said.\nFor Axiata Group, Malaysia’s biggest wireless carrier, the biggest concern is the rising cost of servicing debt. The company has about US$3.6 billion (S$4.8 billion) of US dollar debt.\n“The real concern is we have a large dollar debt, about 50 per cent of that is hedged already,” said Mr Vivek Sood, the company’s CEO.\nSome companies, such as state-owned oil and gas company Petronas, are in a position to benefit from the plunge in the ringgit.\nA significant amount of its operations is either in the foreign markets or pegged to the dollar, S&P said.\nSime Darby Plantation said the weak ringgit is beneficial for the company because its revenue is in US dollars.\n“That is actually very promising for us,” said its chief financial officer Renaka Ramachandran.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/malaysia-companies-brace-for-costly-fallout-as-ringgit-hits-a-26-year-low"}
