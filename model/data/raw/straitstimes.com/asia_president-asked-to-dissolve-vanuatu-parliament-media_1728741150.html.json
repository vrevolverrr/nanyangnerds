The Vanuatu Daily Post cited the Prime Minister's Office.\nThe Vanuatu Prime Minister's Office could not be reached for comment.\nSalwai is Vanuatu's third prime minister since August, when Ishmael Kalsakau was unseated by a vote in parliament after eight months in the role.\nIf the president dissolves parliament, a national election will be held.
