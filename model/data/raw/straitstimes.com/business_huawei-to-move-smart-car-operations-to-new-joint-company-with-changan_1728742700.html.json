Huawei and Seres jointly produce Aito branded cars, including the M7 model.\nHuawei has also built the S7 sedan with Chinese automaker Chery under a new marquee, Luxeed, that it intends to position as a competitor to Tesla’s Model S.\nHuawei said in October it had received more than 50,000 orders for its revamped M7 model over the first 25 days of sales, which would put Aito among China’s five top-selling new energy vehicle manufacturers based on August data.
