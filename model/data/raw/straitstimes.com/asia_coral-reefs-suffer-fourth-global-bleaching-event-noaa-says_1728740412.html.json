Without the algae’s help in delivering nutrients to the corals, the latter cannot survive.\n“More than 54 per cent of the reef areas in the global ocean are experiencing bleaching-level heat stress,” Coral Reef Watch coordinator Derek Manzello said.\nThe announcement of the latest global bleaching event was made jointly by Noaa and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), a global intergovernmental conservation partnership.\nFor an event to be considered global, significant bleaching must occur in all three ocean basins – the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian – within a 365-day period.\nLike 2024’s bleaching event, the last three – in 1998, 2010, and 2014 to 2017 – coincided with an El Nino climate pattern, which typically ushers in warmer sea temperatures.\nSea surface temperatures over the past year have smashed records that have been kept since 1979, as the effects of El Nino are compounded by climate change.\nCorals are invertebrates that live in colonies. Their calcium carbonate secretions form hard and protective scaffolding that serves as a home to many colourful species of single-celled algae.\nScientists have expressed concern that many of the world’s reefs will not recover from the intense, prolonged heat stress.\n“What is happening is new for us, and to science,” said marine ecologist Lorenzo Alvarez-Filip at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\nHe added that “we cannot yet predict how severely stressed corals will do”, even if they survive immediate heat stress.\nRecurring bleaching events are upending earlier scientific models which forecast that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the world’s coral reefs could be lost when global warming reaches 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial temperatures. To date, the world has warmed by some 1.2 deg C.\nIn a 2022 report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, experts determined that just 1.2 deg C of warming would be enough to severely impact coral reefs, “with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature”.\nThe global bleaching event in 2024 adds further weight to concerns among scientists that corals are in grave danger.\n“A realistic interpretation is that we have crossed the tipping point for coral reefs,” said ecologist David Obura, who heads Coastal Oceans Research and Development Indian Ocean East Africa from Mombasa, Kenya.\n“They’re going into a decline that we cannot stop, unless we really stop carbon dioxide emissions” that are driving climate change, Dr Obura added.\nCoral reefs are estimated to provide some US$2.7 trillion (S$3.7 trillion) in goods and services every year – with benefits such as attracting tourists, protecting coastal communities from storm surges, and supporting coastal fisheries, according to a 2020 valuation by ICRI’s scientific network.\nGlobal bleaching could be worst yet\nWith bleaching surveys ongoing in the Indian Ocean and Pacific, Noaa experts expect that this global bleaching event could turn out to be the most extensive yet.\nCaribbean reefs experienced widespread bleaching in August 2023 as coastal sea surface temperatures hovered between 1 deg C and 3 deg C above normal. Scientists working in the region then began documenting mass die-offs across the region.\nFrom the staghorns to brain corals, “everything that you can see while diving was white in some reefs”, Dr Alvarez-Filip said. “I have never witnessed this level of bleaching.”\nBleached corals can recover if waters cool, but some Caribbean corals were so stressed that they continued to die even as temperatures dropped over winter, Dr Alvarez-Filip added.\nFlorida corals subjected to extreme heat shocks did not even have time to bleach, Mr Manzello said.\n“They got so stressed, they just died and sloughed off their tissue,” he said.\nAt the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer in March, tropical reefs in the Pacific and Indian oceans also began to suffer.\nA record-breaking number of individual reefs within the Great Barrier Reef have suffered from heat stress in recent months, and many are now draining of colour, said coral biologist Neal Cantin at the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. Dr Cantin noted that marine heatwaves were registering some 2.5 deg C above the normal summertime maximum.\nRecent aerial surveys have shown “very high” or “extreme” levels of bleaching in nearly half of surveyed reefs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area.\nThat makes this the fifth bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef in just nine years – far more frequent than the twice per decade that scientists expected by the 2030s.\nIndian Ocean reefs off Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya and the Seychelles have also suffered bleaching, though not as severely as in 2016, thanks to an early change in the 2024 monsoon leading to cooler conditions, Dr Obura said.\n“The stress experienced by corals in the region is likely less than it could have been, which is very lucky,” he said.
