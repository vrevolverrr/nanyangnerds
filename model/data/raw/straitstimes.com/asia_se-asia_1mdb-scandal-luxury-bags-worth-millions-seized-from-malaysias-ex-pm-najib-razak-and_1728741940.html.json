The handbags are worth millions and that was how they treated it, \" he said on Wednesday (June 10).\nThe damage on the handbags was realised by Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, and her lawyer during an earlier inspection at Bank Negara on Feb 22 for a separate suit.\nThe matter was raised by Tan Sri Shafee as he made another application to inspect the items, which were seized by the police from an apartment unit owned by Obyu Holdings after Najib's administration lost in the 2018 general election.\nThe application was in relation to the government's forfeiture suit against Obyu Holdings.\nMr Shafee also claimed that the police failed to follow procedures when they conducted the seizures.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Faten Hadni Khairuddin, however, said those were serious allegations against the police, adding that the items were kept in a vault at Bank Negara and only accessible to authorised personnel.\nThe prosecution objected to the application on grounds that the items involved a high value as well as concerns on security.\nAfter hearing the submissions, High Court judge Justice Muhammad Jamil Hussin allowed Najib's application to inspect the items in the presence of his lawyer.\nLast year, the prosecution filed the application to forfeit the assets that were seized from premises belonging to Obyu Holdings Sdn Bhd and were allegedly linked to the 1MDB fund under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/1mdb-scandal-luxury-bags-worth-millions-seized-from-malaysias-ex-pm-najib-razak-and"}
