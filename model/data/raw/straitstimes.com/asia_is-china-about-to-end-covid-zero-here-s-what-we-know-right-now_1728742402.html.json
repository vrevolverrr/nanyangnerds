Mr Scholz said it was a potential first step toward wider adoption in the world’s second-largest economy.\nBioNTech confirmed Monday that it’s in “positive” discussions with Chinese authorities, though it was too early to give any details on the expat vaccination programme, or any wider approval in China for its Covid-19 shot.\nSo is China getting ready to end Covid Zero – or just tweak it?\nThat’s unclear. While relaxing border curbs could help reduce China’s isolation from the rest of the world, it won’t address the more economically-damaging aspects of Covid Zero.\nIt is, however, hard to find concrete signs of China easing its internal Covid-19 playbook of lockdowns, curbs on domestic travel and frequent mass testing.\nWhile Beijing has ramped up its directive for local officials to make Covid Zero less obtrusive, that seems to have mainly resulted in restrictions going under the radar.\nWhat are Chinese officials and state media actually saying about Covid Zero now?\nWhat they’ve always been saying: Officials are sticking to the script, with no cracks in the party line that Covid Zero is the correct approach for China and the government will implement it “unswervingly.”\nInvestors have been trying very hard to read between the lines of how state media and the authorities talk about Covid-19, jumping on what seem to be milder descriptions of the virus as representing a change in the propaganda. While a rhetorical shift is definitely a key indicator to watch for, the recent instances seized on are weak.\nFor example, some traders passed around an article posted on Party mouthpiece The People’s Daily’s health app in which the China CDC’s chief epidemiologist Wu Zunyou appeared to downplay the risk of contracting long Covid. But those comments were made in October, and the article merely conveyed the observations of a Hong Kong-based expert that the definition of long Covid is still in doubt.\nSimilarly, much was made of the local health authority in Henan province describing Covid-19 as a “self-limiting” disease on Oct 31, meaning it can resolve without treatment. But as analysts at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, led by Greater China chief economist Raymond Yeung, wrote in a note on Monday, the phrase is not new, has been used before in China and is irrelevant for the parameters that Beijing focuses on.\n“It means the immune system can develop antibodies to combat the virus,” the analysts wrote. “However, policy makers are still concerned about the impact of long Covid and the burden on medical facilities.”\nWhy the reluctance to pivot despite vaccines and antiviral drugs to treat Covid-19?\nMuch has been made of the fact that China’s vaccines are not as effective as Western mRNA shots and that may account for its reluctance to exit Covid Zero.\nBut the country’s homegrown vaccines are highly effective in preventing fatalities. What’s likelier to be the issue is that even with inoculations and antiviral pills like Pfizer’s Paxlovid – which China is producing domestically – there still remains a small chance of dying from Covid.\nIn China’s vast population, that could amount to millions of deaths, which would be problematic for Mr Xi. He’s held up China’s vastly lower Covid-19 death toll as supreme evidence of the policy’s rectitude, especially compared with the United States.\nThere has been some news on the vaccine front, with Friday’s BioNTech development preceded by the approval and rollout in some cities of a nasal vaccine from Chinese company CanSino Inc.\nBut despite that, the country’s vaccination rate has plateaued, with rates among the elderly still lower than in other countries. Their fears are less about how the vaccine is administered and more around whether it can have adverse effects if taken when you have another medical condition, as many older people tend to.\nIt’s also possible that China’s top leaders may simply be reluctant to allow the virus to spread freely until the risk of death drops further, either through the emergence of an even milder virus variant than Omicron, or the development of even more effective vaccines and antivirals.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/is-china-about-to-end-covid-zero-here-s-what-we-know-right-now"}
