It was published on WUSG’s website, Facebook and Instagram.\nAriffin, who is facing one count of defamation, did not enter a plea in court on April 24. His case will be heard again on May 24.\nOn March 25, 2022, KKH filed a police report after the story was published online.\nThe story reported that on Feb 28, 2022, a woman who was 20 weeks pregnant and was Covid-19 positive had arrived at KKH to seek treatment after experiencing severe abdominal pains at 2pm.\nAccording to the article, the woman said she was then told to wait at the drop-off area and that she started to bleed at 5pm, but was not attended to.\nIn the article, the woman said she saw the doctor only at 6pm, after a four-hour wait, and was told she had lost her baby. She also alleged that her foetus was later discarded as medical waste.\nPolice investigations later revealed the story and its allegations to be false. KKH confirmed that the patient in the story had been seen by a doctor within an hour of her arrival and did not suffer a miscarriage.\nIn March 2022, the Ministry of Health said it had instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office to issue a correction direction to WUSG for publishing the false account.\nThe correction notices were published on the alternative news site’s Facebook and Instagram accounts on March 27, 2022.\nIf found guilty of defamation, a person can be jailed for up to two years, or fined, or both.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/alleged-wake-up-singapore-admin-charged-with-defamation-over-link-to-false-account-at-kkh"}
