Minutes after it relayed targeting data back to a Russian base, a barrage of ballistic missiles struck the airfield, said Ukrainian officials, recounting the episode.\n“That first hit was so powerful that even our windows were trembling,” said Ms Valeria Minenko, 21, who lives near the airbase in Myrhorod, central Ukraine, one of many targeted in relentless attacks by Russia in recent months.\n“Now they’re hitting the airbase with the rockets all the time,” Ms Minenko said.\nRussia has been saturating the skies over Ukraine with surveillance drones, exploiting gaps in air-defence systems, to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks on Ukrainian positions.\nIts dominance in the air along parts of the front has allowed it to bombard Ukrainian positions with hundreds of powerful guided bombs every day, helping its ground forces to make slow and steady gains.\nUkraine’s strategy was to counter Russia in the air war with the aid of long-coveted F-16 fighter jets from the West that it says it will deploy this summer.\nBut the assaults on Ukrainian airbases underscore Russia’s determination to limit the impact of the planes even before they enter the fight. They also highlight the challenges Ukraine faces as it prepares to deploy the sophisticated aircraft for the first time.\nUkraine is hoping the F-16s, which come with powerful electronic warfare systems and an array of other weapons, can be used in coordination with other Western weapons like Patriot air-defence systems to expand the area considered too dangerous for Russian pilots to fly.\nThey also hope the jets will add another layer of protection for Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure from relentless missile and drone attacks.\nBut a shortage of trained pilots and a limited number of jets will constrain the immediate impact, experts say.\n“Russia has had so much time to fortify its defences, especially along the front-line areas,” said Mr Hunter Stoll, a defence analyst at research organisation Rand. “The F-16s and their pilots will face stiff resistance from Russian air defences, both on the ground and in the sky.”\nUkraine says it is “in the process” of moving the first F-16s into the country, about 2½ years after it first pleaded for the aircraft. It has been a year since the Biden administration finally reversed policy and allowed Western allies to transfer American fighter jets to Ukraine.\n“Today, we can already say clearly, we have entered the club of countries that have F-16s,” Mr Yuri Ihnat, a representative for the Ukrainian Air Force, said in an interview. “This is a turning point for our nation.”\nThe arrival of the planes – the exact number has not been publicly revealed – comes at a moment of deep uncertainty in the war.\nRussian forces are engaged in furious assaults all along the 966km front, the Ukrainian energy grid is crippled by years of unrelenting bombardment and a presidential election in the United States could reshape future military assistance.\nIn addition to the Russian attacks on the Ukrainian airfields, Ukraine will also be constrained by the small number of trained pilots, according to Ukrainian and US military officials. About 20 airmen in the various US, Dutch and Danish training pipelines are expected to be ready in 2024, according to US officials.\nAir commanders say they typically allot at least two pilots per aircraft – for crew rest, training and other matters. So that would allow Ukraine to fly only about 10 F-16s, at most, on combat missions in 2024.\nAnother major limiting factor, officials say, is the number of trained maintenance and support personnel on the ground to keep the F-16s flying.\n“It’s not just the pilots you have to have,” General Charles Brown Jr, chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and a long-time F-16 pilot, said in June. “Maintenance is also a key part of that, and training the maintainers.”\nGeneral Serhii Holubtsov, chief of aviation of Ukraine’s air force, said Ukrainians “do not wear rose-coloured glasses” and understand that the F-16 is “not a panacea”.\nThe strategy, he told Donbas Realiy, a branch of Radio Liberty, can be thought of in three phases – “crawl, walk, run” – and it will take time.\n“We haven’t learnt to crawl yet,” he said.\nBefore the jets can start to play a role in shaping the battlefield, Ukraine needs to be sure they can be protected.\nWhile Russia has been attacking Ukrainian airfields since the first hours of the war, the early July attack on Myrhorod was different, Ukrainian officials said.\n“The enemy came up with a new tactic,” Mr Ihnat said.\nSpecifically, he said, the Russians are improving missiles and reconnaissance drones, “making it so that we cannot influence them with electronic warfare”.\nThey are also preprogramming surveillance drones to fly deep into Ukraine without emitting telltale electronic signatures, making them harder to detect.\nGeneral Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s top military commander, said this past week that Ukraine urgently needed to find new methods of destroying enemy drones.\nMr Ihnat said that the Ukrainian Air Force had effectively adopted deception tactics – like building model planes to act as decoys, camouflaging aircraft and moving them – to protect its depleted fleet of Soviet-era aircraft, and would do the same for the F-16s.\n“If someone wants to laugh at this, let them,” he said. “Thanks to the models, the enemy has already lost dozens or even hundreds of their missiles.”\nUkraine is also employing 1970s-vintage Yakovlev Yak-52 training planes to hunt Russian surveillance drones, he said.\nThe propeller-driven aircraft have been hunting Russian surveillance drones across southern Ukraine, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces posting videos of the aerial clashes.\nGen Holubtsov said he expected attacks on the airfields to increase. For that reason, he said, Ukraine will not keep all the promised F-16s in the country.\nPresident Vladimir Putin of Russia has said that the storage abroad of planes or other Ukrainian military assets could “pose a serious danger of Nato being drawn further into the conflict”.\nThe Biden administration’s approach to arming Ukraine has been driven in large part by concerns about potential escalation with Moscow, which is why it resisted allowing the transfer of F-16s from allies for so long.\nRetired Lieutenant-General David Deptula, the dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Washington, said the delay “has given Russia the gift of time”.\n“We gave them time to dig in and establish defences that are now much more difficult to unravel,” he said.
