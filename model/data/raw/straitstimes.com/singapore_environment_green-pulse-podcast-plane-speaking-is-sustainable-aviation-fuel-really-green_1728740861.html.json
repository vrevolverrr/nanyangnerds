But most of us also know that flying produces lots of greenhouse gas emissions and that taking plane trips can be the single biggest component of our carbon footprint each year.\nPlane and engine manufacturers have been pretty good at achieving efficiency gains over the years. But international aviation is growing quickly. Without strong action, emissions from the sector will double or even triple by 2050.\nOne immediate solution being offered is sustainable aviation fuel or SAF for short. But how green is it?\nIn this episode, ST’s climate editor David Fogarty chats with Mr Sami Jauhiainen, regional vice-president for renewable aviation at Neste, a Finnish refining company. It has recently expanded its operations in Singapore and is now a major producer of SAF.\nHighlights (click/tap above):\n1:11 What is sustainable aviation fuel and how is it made?\n4:14 Does Neste use any food crops to produce the fuel?\n9:07 Current global demand for SAF\n11:59 Environmental benefits and emissions reductions from using SAF\n18:07 The current cost of SAF? How will the costs fall?\nProduced by: David Fogarty (dfogarty@sph.com.sg), Ernest Luis, Hadyu Rahim & Paxton Pang\nEdited by: Hadyu Rahim\nFollow Green Pulse Podcast here and rate us:\nChannel: https://str.sg/JWaf\nApple Podcasts: https://str.sg/JWaY\nSpotify: https://str.sg/JWag\nGoogle Podcasts: https://str.sg/J6EV\nWebsite: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\nFeedback to: podcast@sph.com.sg\nFollow David Fogarty on X: https://str.sg/JLM6\nRead his articles: https://str.sg/JLMu\n---\nDiscover more ST podcast channels:\nCOE Watch: https://str.sg/iTtE\nIn Your Opinion: https://str.sg/w7Qt\nAsian Insider: https://str.sg/JWa7\nHealth Check: https://str.sg/JWaN\nGreen Pulse: https://str.sg/JWaf\nYour Money & Career: https://str.sg/wB2m\nST Sports Talk: https://str.sg/JWRE\n#PopVultures: https://str.sg/JWad\nMusic Lab: https://str.sg/w9TX\nDiscover ST Podcasts: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\n---\nSpecial edition series:\nTrue Crimes Of Asia (new): https://str.sg/i44T\nThe Unsolved Mysteries of South-east Asia (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuZ2\nInvisible Asia (9 eps): https://str.sg/wuZn\nStop Scams (10 eps): https://str.sg/wuZB\nSingapore’s War On Covid (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuJa\n---\nFollow our shows then, if you like short, practical podcasts!", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/green-pulse-podcast-plane-speaking-is-sustainable-aviation-fuel-really-green"}
