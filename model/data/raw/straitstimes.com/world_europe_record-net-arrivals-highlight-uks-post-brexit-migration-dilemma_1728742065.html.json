Many who voted to leave cited high migration and the pressure they said it imposed on public services.\nOn the other hand, Britain is facing labour shortages in key sectors, partly due to an exodus of EU nationals caused by Brexit itself. Tight labour market conditions are a factor in the country’s persistently high inflation.\nOn the same day the government announced the tightening of rules for students’ family members, it also said it was relaxing visa rules for fishermen due to a labour shortage.\nThe opposition Labour Party said separate government data published on Thursday showing a 119 per cent increase in the number of work visas issued - around 300,000 in the year to March 2023 - was evidence that the government’s policy was in chaos.\n“Ministers have completely failed to tackle skills shortages, especially in health and social care, or to get people back into work after Covid,” Labour immigration policy chief Yvette Cooper said.\nImmigration minister Robert Jenrick said the combination of new measures and easing of temporary inflows from Ukraine and Hong Kong would see net migration fall and return to pre-pandemic levels.\nHe added that being outside the EU meant it could better control immigration.\nNet migration to Britain in 2015, the year before the Brexit referendum, was 329,000.\nThe data put overall immigration in 2022 at around 1.16 million, offset by emigration of 557,000.\nThe ONS said 925,000 of those arriving in 2022 were non-EU nationals, 151,000 came from the EU and 88,000 were British citizens.\nIt estimated that in 2022 under the special visa schemes there were 114,000 long-term arrivals from Ukraine and 52,000 from Hong Kong.
