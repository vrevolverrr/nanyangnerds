While it is a significant amount, it is less than previously estimated. In fact, it is nearly half of the estimated extinction rate of 73 per cent in a well-cited 2003 paper.\nThe latest study, which involved 27 experts and junior researchers and used novel mathematical models, was published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in December 2023.\nNotably, the decade-long research led by theoretical ecologist Ryan Chisholm from the National University of Singapore (NUS) developed statistical methods that accounted for dark extinctions – the unknown number of plants and animals that died out before they were discovered.\nGlobally, these silent extinctions have posed a problem for scientists looking to chart the true scale of human-driven extinction.\n“The findings are significant for Singapore,” said Associate Professor Chisholm, who conceived the research idea in 2012.\n“(The study) gives more accurate estimates of extinctions than past studies, and it identifies large and charismatic species as having been particularly vulnerable to extinction here.”\nCharismatic species are fauna and flora that garner more public interest due to their aesthetic appeal or cultural significance. In the Singapore context, examples of these species include pangolins and orchids, said Prof Chisholm.\nHistorical records for flora and fauna groups here that are not as well studied can be too sparse, making it difficult to figure out just how many species once existed on the island.\nDr Tan Heok Hui, fish curator at NUS’ natural history museum, who co-authored the recent paper, said much of the original freshwater fish on the island was likely to have been unrecorded as the earliest checklist dates back to the 1960s, almost two decades after large tracts of mangrove and freshwater forests had been cleared.\nHe said: “The freshwater fish records may not be complete, but nonetheless provide a vital clue to past events.”\nTo paint the most accurate picture of extinctions in Singapore, the researchers painstakingly assembled a comprehensive database of records, comprising more than 50,600 observations of over 3,060 species from 10 major animal and plant groups.\nThe library ranges from the oldest natural history material obtained in Singapore – a sea teak stalk collected in 1796 – to social media sightings and citizen records, such as a photo taken by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of a black-headed collared snake, which is a vulnerable species here.\nOn a positive note, the team found that overall extinctions appear to have slowed or ceased in most animal and plant groups by the 21st century. In fact, some species have already recovered or have naturally spread from nearby Malaysia to Singapore.\nNational Parks Board (NParks) senior researcher Chong Kwek Yan, who was a co-author of the study, said the slowdown in extinction rate can be credited to low poaching rates – a key driver of extinction elsewhere – and the existence of secondary forests in nature reserves like the Central Catchment Nature Reserve that have long records of protection since the colonial days.\n“These areas have had the opportunity to mature and can serve as refugia,” he said, referring to a safe haven that species can go to survive changing environmental conditions.\nHowever, the researchers also cautioned that populations of some remaining species confined to small forest remnants could still disappear due to their small numbers. These include some forest-dependent songbirds.\nIt remains to be seen whether poaching rates will drop across other South-east Asian countries as they develop – if not, species targeted by poachers will be lost at higher rates than extrapolations from Singapore would suggest, the researchers wrote.\nLauding the study, Dr Shawn Lum, a senior lecturer at Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment, who was not involved in the research, said: “(The) approach allows scientists to accurately estimate possible extinction rates under a ‘business as usual’ land-use scenario anywhere, and gives policymakers, land managers, non-governmental organisations, and the entire conservation and development ecosystem a chance to find realistic and pragmatic solutions to hold, and ultimately reverse, the extinction curve.”", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-lost-nearly-40-of-its-biodiversity-in-past-200-years-not-as-much-as-was-believed-study"}
