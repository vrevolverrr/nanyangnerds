It chewed down to the bone and cracked it,” he said.\n“But because of all this, I discovered that my foot is completely numb, I can’t feel anything.”\nHis wife immediately took him to a nearby hospital, where he was warded for nine days.\nDoctors did a CT scan on the injured toe and discovered two blocked arteries. They warned Mr Lindsay, who suffers from diabetes, that he risked losing his leg if the blood supply was not returned.\nDoctors were also assessing whether to have a stent procedure to open up the arteries to allow blood flow to return to his legs.\nDespite the pup’s naughty behaviour, Mr Lindsay has no plans to get rid of it.\n“You’ve got to laugh about it. He’s done me a favour by chewing my toe,” said the grandfather to 11 children.\n“So I’m waiting to find out if they can put stents in. I’ll be keeping the dog. I’ll try to keep my toe too, but if not I told the doctor to cut it off and I can take it home for him!”\nHe added he was looking forward to going home to his family and his cheeky pup by the end of this week.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/puppy-saves-english-man-s-life-by-chewing-his-toe-to-the-bone"}
