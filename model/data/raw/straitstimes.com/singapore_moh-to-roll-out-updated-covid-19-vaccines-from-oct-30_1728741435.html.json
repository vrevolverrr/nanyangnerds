They are expected to have died out, so using a bivalent vaccine will distract the immune system by having it respond to a variant that is unlikely to recur or make a comeback.”\nThere was a 15.8 per cent rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore between the periods of Oct 10 to Oct 16 and Oct 17 to Oct 22, from 14,801 to 17,123.\nThese were driven mostly by EG.5 and its sub-variant HK.3, both of which are descended from the XBB Omicron variant. Together, they account for more than 75 per cent of cases recorded now.\nFrom Nov 4 to Dec 2, the operating hours of all JTVCs will be extended on Saturdays, from 9am to 7pm – instead of the usual opening hours from 9am to 1pm – in case there is higher demand for the updated vaccines.\nA longer waiting period should be expected on Fridays and Saturdays, said MOH.\nMore information on the operating hours of JTVCs is available at https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations/jtvc/ or by contacting the PHPCs.\nMOH said: “Vaccination remains our primary defence against Covid-19, and continues to be safe and effective.”\nEarlier this month, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said protection against severe forms of Covid-19 – whether through vaccination or from contracting the disease – wanes close to the 12-month mark, and those most at risk must take the shots yearly to avoid getting severely ill.\nSpeaking at the opening of the Stepping Stones Rehabilitation Centre and addiction medicine ward Serenity Centre at the Institute of Mental Health on Oct 6, he said there are no plans to impose social restrictions, but the virus that causes Covid-19 has not become milder since the pandemic.\nThe latest Health Sciences Authority data found that reporting rates of adverse events and serious adverse events for the mRNA vaccines – both monovalent and bivalent versions – remained rare at 0.10 per cent and 0.007 per cent, respectively, said MOH.\nIt added that the incidence of myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – has remained rare, with reporting rates of one per 100,000 doses (0.001 per cent) for the monovalent vaccines and 0.4 per 100,000 doses (0.0004 per cent) for the bivalent vaccines.\n“Protection from vaccination will wane over time. We therefore encourage all individuals to keep up to date with their vaccination once eligible,” said MOH.\nThe nearest vaccination site and the types of vaccines offered at each site are listed at https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/vaccine\nThose who prefer to book an appointment for their vaccination can either call the clinic directly or do so at https://book.health.gov.sg/covid", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/moh-to-roll-out-updated-covid-19-vaccines-from-oct-30"}
