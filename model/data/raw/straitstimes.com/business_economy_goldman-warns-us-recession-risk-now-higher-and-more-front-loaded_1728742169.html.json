As to whether there is a recession in the near term, that is more likely than not,” Mr Musk said in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha.\n“It is not a certainty, but it appears more likely than not,” Mr Musk said.\nThe world’s richest person told Tesla executives earlier this month that he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.\nGoldman Sachs economists cut their US growth forecasts and warned in a research note on Monday that the risk of recession is rising.\nThe Goldman team sees a 30 per cent chance of the US entering a recession over the next year, up from 15 per cent previously, and a 25 per cent conditional probability of entering a recession in the second year if one is avoided in the first.\n“The main reasons are that our baseline growth path is now lower and that we are increasingly concerned that the Fed will feel compelled to respond forcefully to high headline inflation and consumer inflation expectations if energy prices rise further, even if activity slows sharply,” economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote.\nMr Roubini, an economist famous for predicting the global financial crisis, said he expects a US recession by the end of the year. Measures of consumer confidence, retail sales, manufacturing activity and housing are all slowing sharply while inflation is high, Mr Roubini said on Bloomberg Television.\n“We’re getting very close,” he said.\nSeeking to quell a surge in living costs, the Fed accelerated its monetary-tightening campaign last week with its biggest interest-rate increase since 1994. That drove fresh losses on Wall Street and has increased the odds of a recession, piling pressure on President Joe Biden.\nMr Biden reiterated Monday that a US recession isn’t “inevitable” following a conversation with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who sees a significant chance the country will find itself battling stagflation.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/goldman-warns-us-recession-risk-now-higher-and-more-front-loaded"}
