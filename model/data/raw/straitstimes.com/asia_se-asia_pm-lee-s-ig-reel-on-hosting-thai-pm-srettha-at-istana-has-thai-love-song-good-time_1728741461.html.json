Singaporeans also enjoy visiting Thailand for the scenery, culture, food and shopping, just as Thais like to come to Singapore too,” he wrote.\nPM Lee noted that Thailand’s strong support for the Singapore Armed Forces’ training in the kingdom for over 40 years “has also deepened our defence relationship”.\nHis message and its accompanying Instagram reel were posted shortly after Mr Srettha completed his Singapore visit, the last stop in a five-day trip that also took the Thai leader to Hong Kong, Brunei and Malaysia.\nMany followers of PM Lee’s Instagram account praised the use of the Thai song in the accompanying video.\nThe lyrics of a section of the song used in the Instagram reel can be translated as:\nYou make the journey along the way the most beautiful\nI am lucky to have you on this road with me\nNo matter how far we have to go\nA hundred or thousand miles away\nThe horizon we aim for could be reached some day\nWhen he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Thailand last November, PM Lee uploaded photos on his social media account of the “Welcome to Thailand” dish served to world leaders at a gala dinner and of Thai cultural performances.
