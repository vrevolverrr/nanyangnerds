My mispronunciations can elicit a smile and a laugh.\nIn doing business here for 39 years, I have found suppliers and customers to be helpful. However, I would never try to negotiate a transaction in Mandarin. I still cannot distinguish the tones for the words “buy” and “sell”.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/letter-of-the-week-please-be-patient-when-i-try-to-speak-mandarin"}
