Valued at $4.96 million, the vehicles include vans and pickup trucks.\nThey will be used in PUB’s daily operations, including for quick response in areas impacted by flash floods, water quality sampling and delivering water to locations during disruptions.\nPUB chief sustainability officer Ridzuan Ismail told The Straits Times that the new EVs will replace 47 vehicles with internal combustion engines in 2025, and follow a pilot batch of six units in 2021.\n“This is in line with Singapore’s vision to phase out vehicles with internal combustion engines and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040,” he said.\nThe agency said in its 2022 sustainability report that it wanted to progressively replace 70 diesel-powered vehicles by 2024 to reduce carbon emissions with “suitable EV models running on cleaner energy”.\nAt present, PUB has nearly 180 vehicles.\nAccording to Mr Ridzuan, being able to configure a vehicle to suit PUB’s operational needs is one of its considerations with the transition to EVs.\n“Other factors include the availability of commercial EVs on the market, as well as the vehicles’ range and battery life,” he added.\nResponding to queries from ST, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) said all new cars procured and registered by the public sector from 2023 must be clean-energy models with no tailpipe emissions, as part of the Government’s GreenGov.SG sustainability initiative launched in 2021.\nThese would generally refer to EVs. There are alternative technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles but these are not readily available.\nStatutory boards will make the switch to EVs when the certificates of entitlement of their vehicles expire or when the vehicles are due for replacement, MOT added.\nThere are no available figures on the rate of government-wide EV adoption. MOT said the number of government fleet vehicles that have been converted to EVs is “still low”, as the requirement was introduced only in the public sector’s 2023 financial year, which started in April 2023.\n“However, we expect the number to rise with time when the vehicles are due for replacement and as EV adoption across the vehicle segments rises.”\nThe ministry added that the same requirement applies to other types of vehicles, such as trucks used by the public sector, but this depends on feasibility, since the availability of EV models is not as prevalent and may also be significantly costlier.\nChecks with motor dealers suggest that there is a variety of goods-carrying electric vans from various brands, including BYD from China, Citroen from France and Mercedes-Benz from Germany.\nBut there are few options when it comes to other types of light commercial vehicles, such as minibuses, small refrigerated trucks or vehicles with open loading decks.\nBased on information from the Government’s procurement portal GeBiz, for the PUB contract, only three of the eight participating parties submitted bids to supply electric double cabin vehicles, or pickup trucks.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/pub-to-replace-47-diesel-powered-vehicles-with-evs-in-2025-in-deals-worth-almost-5m"}
