The existing CTF in Tampines will be converted back to a nursing home around April.\nSengkang Community Hospital, which has been serving as a CTF, will be reconfigured to allow it to attend more to BAU patients to \"especially\" serve Sengkang General Hospital.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/as-omicron-wave-eases-hospitals-to-focus-more-on-business-as-usual-patients-ong-ye-kung"}
