But officials this month suggested it could be lower.\nThe EU’s economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said there were downside risks to economic growth because of “geopolitical tensions”, especially in the Middle East.\nThe commission will present its latest forecasts in February 2024.\nThe euro zone economy was weighed down in 2023 by the performance of the continent’s powerhouse Germany.\nThe German economy shrank 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2023, Eurostat said.\nGermany has been hit hard by multiple factors including meek consumption, falling orders for exports and confusion over the government budget.\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner dismissed accusations that his country was the “sick man” of Europe during an event at the World Economic Forum earlier in January 2024.\n“Germany is a tired man after a short night and the low-growth expectations are partly a wake-up call,” he said.\nFrance, the EU’s second-biggest economy, recorded zero growth in the final two quarters of 2023 while Italy, the third-largest, expanded by just 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter.\nIreland’s economy recorded the biggest contraction for the period, shrinking 0.7 per cent.\nThere are hopes the European Central Bank will start cutting interest rates before the northern hemisphere’s summer, although ECB chief Christine Lagarde said last week it was too early to discuss such action.\nOn Feb 1, Eurostat will publish inflation data for January, after the annual rate reached 2.9 per cent in December. That is still above the ECB’s two-per cent target. AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/euro-zone-narrowly-dodges-recession"}
