The inland quake did not trigger any tsunami warning.\nThe Osaka region, which is Japan's second-biggest metropolitan area after Greater Tokyo, is a major industrial hub and tourist hot spot in western Japan. The city is set to host the Group of 20 (G-20) leaders' meeting in June next year.\nThe epicentre of the temblor was near the residential Takatsuki district, about an hour to the north of the main tourist area of Dotonbori.\nThe quake shattered windows, brought down walls and damaged cultural treasures such as a 16th century tea house in neighbouring Kyoto.\nSeveral areas were flooded by water gushing out of burst water mains, while news pictures also showed felled signs at a train station, and shops in disarray with products thrown off their shelves.\nThe JMA has warned that aftershocks of a similar magnitude may occur over the next week. In 2016 in Kumamoto, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake was followed two days later by a magnitude 7.0 tremor, which caused more damage and deaths than the first tremblor.\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured the tremor at magnitude 5.3, at a depth of 15.4km. The JMA put its preliminary magnitude at 5.9 at a depth of 10km, which it later revised to magnitude 6.1 at a depth of 13km.\nThe tremor registered a six-minus on the seven-point Japanese shindo scale, which measures earthquakes by their impact on the public and not by geology.\nA reading of six-minus means that most will find it difficult to remain standing. This was the strongest reading that has been registered in Osaka prefecture since records started being kept in 1923.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that his government will do its utmost to ensure emergency measures are in place, and will continue to work to restore public transportation and gas services.\nAssistant Professor Wei Shengji of Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore told The Straits Times on Monday that the earthquake \"occurred in the same strike-slip fault system\" as the 1995 earthquake in neighbouring Kobe, where a magnitude 6.9 earthquake killed nearly 6,500 people.\n\"It is, therefore, not unexpected for an earthquake to happen in a fault system that is currently active,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-earthquake-has-preliminary-magnitude-of-59"}
