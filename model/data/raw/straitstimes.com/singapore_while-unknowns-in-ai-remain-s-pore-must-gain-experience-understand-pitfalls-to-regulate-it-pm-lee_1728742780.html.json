But would it progress all the way to the point of having a conversation, said PM Lee.\nHe added: “Either the chatbot can interview me, or I may interview the chatbot… Or two chatbots may be talking to each other better than us.”\nPerhaps putting in 10 times more chips or 10 times more effort in computing, AI could reach that level, or it could also reach a limit, he said.\n“Then you need another breakthrough conceptually, to take it to the next level where it’s got insight, understanding, judgment, reasoning and empathy,” said PM Lee.\nIn principle, there is no reason why a machine that can think, act, speak and look like it feels like a human being cannot be built, he added.\n“Some philosophers think it’s not possible. I don’t believe that. I think it is possible but I don’t know how long it will take,” he said.\nBut when that happens, there will be some profound questions thrown up that are difficult to answer, he added.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/while-unknowns-in-ai-remain-s-pore-must-gain-experience-understand-pitfalls-to-regulate-it-pm-lee"}
