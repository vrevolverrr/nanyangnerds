Working 6.5 hours daily or 65 hours fortnightly, they can earn substantially.\nWhile fair compensation for those handling full-time teaching responsibilities is essential, MOE’s revised payment scheme benefits all National Institute of Education-trained teachers who have resigned or retired, regardless of their teaching load, whether teaching full classes or doing relief teaching.\nPreviously, flexi-adjunct teachers doing ad-hoc relief teaching received daily wages. Since the shift to hourly pay, their salaries have surged by as much as 50 per cent.\nMany of them handle relief teaching or merely babysit the classes, but can earn as much as $6,500 to $7,800 a month if they work every day, which many do. Those working at least 90 days in a school also enjoy various leave benefits.\nInstead of a blanket raise for all flexi-adjunct teachers, MOE could redirect its resources to support full-time teachers.\nIt is disheartening that while a full-time teacher earns merely $3,000, others who handle fewer responsibilities earn more than double that salary.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-why-are-flexi-adjunct-teachers-paid-more-than-full-time-teachers"}
