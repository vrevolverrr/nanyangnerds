But the parties are now in disagreement over the settlement, which stipulates that Goldman Sachs should make an interim payment if Malaysia did not recover at least US$500 million from the firm by August 2022.\nGoldman Sachs sued Malaysia in a British court in October 2023 for the Malaysian government’s alleged violation of its obligations to appropriately credit assets against the guarantee provided by Goldman Sachs in the settlement agreement and to recover other assets worth US$1.4 billion. Malaysia has denied the allegations that it breached the settlement deal.\nOn Jan 23, Kuala Lumpur accused Goldman Sachs of trying to offset 1MDB fines and settlements recovered from other institutions such as AmBank, and Abu Dhabi’s International Petroleum Investment against the US$1.4 billion sum.\nMr Johari said the fines and settlements were not within the scope of Goldman’s asset recovery guarantee.\nThe 1MDB taskforce was also examining whether negotiators and lawyers representing the Malaysian government at the time failed to secure a fair and adequate settlement from Goldman Sachs, given the firm’s role in the scandal.\nGoldman had helped 1MDB raise US$6.5 billion through bond sales, earning US$600 million in fees, which was “unusually high”, Mr Johari said.\n“Such lapses on the part of negotiators and lawyers, in failing to negotiate a fair and clear settlement agreement, have compromised the government of Malaysia’s position in the ongoing dispute.” REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-considers-legal-proceedings-against-foreign-banks-linked-to-1mdb-graft"}
