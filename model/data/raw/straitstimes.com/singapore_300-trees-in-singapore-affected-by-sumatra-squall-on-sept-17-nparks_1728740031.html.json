Some cars and structures were also affected,” she said, adding that the wind was very strong.\nMs Indranee said the Tanjong Pagar Town Council horticulture team and their contractors have been hard at work clearing the fallen trees and debris, and checking on the condition of nearby trees.\nThe property team will also follow up on the damage caused by the fallen trees and carry out the necessary rectification works, she added.\nShe said that those who had properties affected by the fallen trees can contact the Tanjong Pagar Town Council, should they need any assistance.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/300-trees-in-singapore-affected-by-sumatra-squall-on-sept-17-nparks"}
