Beijing posted 13 new cases, and Shanghai had 32.\nChina is sticking to the zero-Covid pillars of lockdowns and mass testing to tame its biggest flare up in two months, despite the heavy cost.\nThe policy has dragged on growth in the world’s second-biggest economy and roiled global supply chains as important manufacturing hubs – from cars, to phones and Christmas trees – contend with the disruption of shutdowns and reopenings.\nPresident Xi Jinping on Sunday signalled no looming change to the approach, disappointing investors who were hoping for some signs of loosening.\nDuring a speech opening the twice-a-decade Party Congress in Beijing, he said the strict rules protect people’s lives, though he avoided mentioning the economic toll.\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg predict growth of just 3.3 per cent this year, the second-weakest pace in more than four decades.\nThe stringent Covid-19 curbs have also been stoking public discontent.\nCensorship went into overdrive late last week, with words such as “Beijing” and “bridge” restricted on social media platforms like Weibo after two banners criticising Mr Xi and zero-Covid were displayed on a bridge in the capital. One read: “We want food, not PCR tests. We want freedom, not lockdowns and controls.”\nWhile China’s most important cities have so far avoided large-scale lockdowns, officials have instead been quietly halting a growing list of activities.\nSeveral schools in Shanghai have suspended in-person classes, as the fear of infection spread grows, according to parents and social media posts.\nThe port city of Tianjin last week announced a lockdown of one district, and the southern megacity of Guangzhou shut schools in one area.
