He allegedly took bribes in 2022 from two peddlers to refrain from taking enforcement action against them.\nHe had allegedly worked with another officer, Mohammad Hafizudin Hanapiah, a 30-year-old former security officer, to obtain the gratification from one of the peddlers.\nHafizudin, who was handed one corruption charge, was also slapped with a criminal breach of trust charge for dishonestly misappropriating seized illegal sex enhancement drugs worth $106 for his own use. This happened between June to September 2022.\nThe third officer, Mohd Aris Jalil, 66, had also stolen such drugs that were seized for his own use, sometime before Sept 13, 2022. The former auxiliary police officer was handed a criminal breach of trust charge.\nThiru had allegedly conspired with Hafizudin on two occasions between May and June 2022 to obtain gratification amounting to $140 from Chinese national Chen Zixiong.\nChen Zixiong, 30, was handed a corruption charge on Friday.\nOn three other occasions in July 2022, Thiru had also allegedly obtained from another Chinese national Chen Dongliang gratification amounting to $750 as an inducement to refrain from taking law enforcement action against him for peddling sex enhancement drugs.\nIn court on Friday, Thiru’s lawyer Riko Isaac said he would not be making an indication if his client was pleading guilty or claiming trial at this juncture. His case was adjourned to Dec 4.\nAris and Hafizudin did not have a lawyer and indicated their intention to plead guilty. They will return to court on Monday.\nChen Zixiong, who was also unrepresented, said he was unsure if he would plead guilty and wanted to seek legal advice. He will return to court on Dec 4.\nA person who is convicted of corruption can be fined up to $100,000, jailed for up to five years, or both.\nThose convicted of criminal breach of trust can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-certis-officers-charged-with-taking-bribes-from-sex-drug-peddlers-stealing-drugs-for-own-use"}
