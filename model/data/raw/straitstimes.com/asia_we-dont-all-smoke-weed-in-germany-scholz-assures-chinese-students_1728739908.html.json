I'll be 66 this year and I've never smoked cannabis.\"\nThe chancellor, who is on a visit to China and will meet leaders in Beijing on Tuesday, said Germany wanted to bring cannabis \"out of the grey area\".\nSome 4 million people consumed cannabis in Germany in 2022, according to health ministry data.
