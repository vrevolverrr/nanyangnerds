It has 108.7 billion yuan (S$20.6 billion) of debt due within 12 months but cash of only around 101 billion yuan as at June.\nIt avoided default by winning approval from its creditors to extend payments on an onshore private bond, in a major relief for the embattled Chinese developer as well as the crisis-hit property sector.\nThe developer in August missed coupon payments worth US$22.5 million tied to two dollar bonds but managed to wire funds before a grace period ended earlier in September, dodging a default.\nLast week, onshore bond holders approved to extend repayments of seven other Country Garden bonds by three years.\nShares in Country Garden, one of the few large Chinese developers that have not defaulted on debt obligations, were trading up nearly 1 per cent in Hong Kong, while the broader market was down 0.9 per cent.\nMany creditors believe that Country Garden will have to restructure its offshore debt if it does not get liquidity support soon.\nSome offshore creditors of Country Garden have started talks with New York-based law firm Kobre & Kim and London-based Ashurst, and are looking at forming groups if the property developer seeks to restructure its debt.
