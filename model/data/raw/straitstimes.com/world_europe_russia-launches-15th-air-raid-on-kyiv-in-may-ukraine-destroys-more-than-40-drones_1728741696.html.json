It is also one of three included in a United Nations-brokered deal on the safe export of grain via the Black Sea.\nWith a long-promised Ukrainian counter-offensive looming to recapture territory taken by Russia in the 15th months of the war, Moscow has intensified its attacks, targeting military infrastructure and supplies.\nWhile Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia, a series of strikes inside the country have targeted military, energy and transport infrastructure, with Moscow blaming Kyiv for the attacks.
