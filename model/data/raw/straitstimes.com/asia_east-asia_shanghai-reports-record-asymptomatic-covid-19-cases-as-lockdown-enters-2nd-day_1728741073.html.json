Then the lockdown will start in the city's west for another four days.\nShanghai has also further tightened restrictions, Bloomberg reported.\nAll residents in the Pudong District, home to many elite financial institutions and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, will be confined to their homes and allowed out only to get a Covid-19 test, according to a statement issued by the area’s residential compounds reviewed by Bloomberg.\nResidents shouldn’t walk in the hallways, garages or open areas of their residential compounds in order to reduce the risk of infection, Wu Qianyu, an official with the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, said during a briefing on Tuesday.\nThat includes walking pets.\nPreviously residents could go to the lobby of their buildings and walk around the open areas of their compounds.\nSome could even leave the complex as long as no infections had been detected in their buildings.\nWhile the Shanghai government said Sunday night that residents were required to stay home, the tough confinement curbs were not articulated until Tuesday.\nThe city also rolled out a slew of measures, including tax relief, rent extension or reductions, and loan support for small businesses, retail and catering industries hit hard by the outbreak, officials said.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/shanghai-reports-record-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-as-lockdown-enters-2nd-day"}
