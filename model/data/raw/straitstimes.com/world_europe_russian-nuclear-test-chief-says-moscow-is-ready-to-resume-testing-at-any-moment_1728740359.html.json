It is ready in its entirety. Laboratory and testing facilities are ready. The personnel are ready. If the order comes, we can start testing at any moment,\" said Sinitsyn.\nPictured in his naval uniform alongside a cabinet holding a book about Putin and a giant white porcelain polar bear, Sinitsyn painted a picture of a facility kept in a high state of readiness that was protected by elite troops.\n\"The most important thing for us is not to disrupt the implementation of state tasks. If the task of resuming tests is set, it will be accomplished within the time frame stipulated,\" he said.\n'DEMONSTRATIVE TEST'\nPutin, in charge of the world's largest nuclear power, signed a law last November withdrawing Russia's ratification of the global treaty banning nuclear weapons tests, a move he said was designed to bring Russia into line with the United States, which signed but never ratified the treaty.\nRussian diplomats said at the time that Moscow would not resume nuclear testing unless Washington does. Putin said in June Russia could test a nuclear weapon \"if necessary\", but saw no need to do so at the present time.\nThe United States last tested in 1992. Only North Korea has conducted a test involving a nuclear explosion this century.\nA senior member of a Russian think-tank whose ideas sometimes become government policy suggested in May that Moscow consider a \"demonstrative\" nuclear explosion to cow the West.\nIn an article for Profil, a business magazine, Dmitry Suslov said Russia needed to act to dissuade the West from crossing a red line.\n\"The political and psychological effect of a nuclear mushroom cloud, which will be shown live on all TV channels around the world, will hopefully remind Western politicians of the one thing that has prevented wars between the great powers since 1945 and that they have now largely lost - fear of nuclear war,\" Suslov wrote.
