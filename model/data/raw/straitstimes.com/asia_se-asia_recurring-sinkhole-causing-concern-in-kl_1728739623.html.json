Something should be done quickly before an accident happens,” said Mr Loke, 38.\nWhen contacted, DBKL said a contractor had been appointed on Oct 7 to investigate the cause of the sinkhole.\nExcavation work began on Oct 9 and is expected to be completed on Oct 16.\nThe scope of work includes excavating the affected area, identifying and repairing the source of the sinkhole, followed by backfill and repaving of the road surface.\nDBKL has asked road users in the area to be careful and follow safety instructions closely during this period.\nSeparately, Indah Water Konsortium in a press statement said it had dispatched a team with camera equipment to inspect the condition of the underground sewerage pipe in the area.\nThe pipe was found to be in good condition and no collapse was recorded nearby, the utility company stated. The company has shared its findings with DBKL. THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/recurring-sinkhole-causing-concern-in-kl"}
