He made the news in 2023 after he organised a Facebook contest where he gave away a hotel stay to the PHV driver who could make the most money in a day.\nA 42-year-old part-time PHV driver who wanted to be known as Mr Huang said he has spent four months trying to get back the $16,000 that he lent Mr Lee.\nMr Lee had approached him in mid-January, claiming he had a confectionery business and needed money to fulfil a large order for hampers during the Chinese New Year period.\n“I readily loaned him the money, because he was so active in the PHV driver community online. He seemed quite selfless, and was actively contributing,” Mr Huang said.\nHe added that Mr Lee has repaid him only $6,000.\nHe made a police report, which The Straits Times has seen, on May 17. The police confirmed that apart from Mr Huang, multiple reports have been filed and investigations are ongoing.\nMr Huang said he realised there were other drivers like him when he saw a Facebook post on May 15 by someone looking for Mr Lee.\nMore drivers have since come forward with complaints about Mr Lee, and a WhatsApp group chat was created with about 15 members in all.\nThe group estimates that the unpaid loans amount to more than $160,000.\nAccording to Mr Huang, Mr Lee had promised interest of about 18 per cent to 20 per cent on the loans, but Mr Huang also said many drivers decided to help Mr Lee because he was a helpful member of the PHV community.\nFor instance, he would mentor newer PHV drivers and recommend car washes that provided discounts, said Mr Huang.\nIn some cases, Mr Lee would allegedly claim to be a shareholder of Aurora Soft – a start-up developing a new ride-hailing app called Beep Beep – and seek money which he claimed would be invested in the platform.\nMr Sophian Abdullah, a director at Aurora Soft, said PHV drivers had told him at a launch event on April 16 for the Beep Beep app that Mr Lee allegedly claimed “to be a shareholder in the firm” to get loans from them.\n“He had been asking for money, which he said was needed to pay for the buffet and venue, although this was untrue,” said Mr Sophian.\nIt led Beep Beep to publish a note on Facebook on May 17, saying that it was not affiliated with any individuals seeking investments on its and its parent company’s behalf.\nMr Sophian said he had lent Mr Lee money on two occasions – a $10,000 loan in April supposedly to help Mr Lee’s kueh lapis business, and $1,050 on May 21 because Mr Lee said he could not pay the rental fee for his car.\nThe business loan was meant to help a friend out, as Mr Lee had been active in providing feedback on the Beep Beep app, said Mr Sophian.\nHe added that he lent Mr Lee the second sum even after reports of unpaid loans from other drivers had surfaced, so that Mr Lee could keep driving and repay those he had borrowed money from.\nWhen contacted, Mr Lee said he had not scammed anyone, and added that he has made plans to repay those affected.\nBut he declined to give details about the repayments and also did not answer questions about why he had asked for money.\n“I just want to clear everything and let the matter rest in peace,” he said.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-reports-filed-against-private-hire-driver-for-multiple-unpaid-loans-totalling-over-160k"}
