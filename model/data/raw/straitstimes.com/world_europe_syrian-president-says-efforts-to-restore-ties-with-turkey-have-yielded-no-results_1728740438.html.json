Assad views the rebels as terrorists.\n\"The solution is openness,\" Assad said. \"Restoring a relationship requires first removing the causes that led to its destruction.\"\nThe Syrian president made clear that while he wants Turkish troops to withdraw from Syria, that was not a precondition for talks.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said earlier in July he would extend an invitation to Assad \"any time\" for possible talks to restore relations.\nA Turkish newspaper earlier reported Erdogan and Assad could meet in August, but a Turkish diplomat denied the report.\nRussia has been trying to facilitate a meeting between the two leaders in an effort to restore ties. Iraq also said in July that it may seek to try to bring the two leaders together REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/syrian-president-says-efforts-to-restore-ties-with-turkey-have-yielded-no-results"}
