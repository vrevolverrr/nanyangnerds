We’re confident and determined to meet the deadline but it remains a day-to-day battle,” Mr Philippe Jost, the civil servant in charge of restoration, told BFM TV last week.\nThe monument’s new spire is identical to the previous one, designed by the 19th-century architect Eugene Viollet-Le-Duc.\nIts oak structure is to reach its full height of 96m by the end of 2023. It will then be covered in lead ornaments before the scaffolding is taken down, Mr Jost said.\nThe frames of the nave and the choir of the cathedral, which were also destroyed, are then due for completion, after which the reconstruction of the roof can begin.\nThe final stages are to include cleaning the interior – an area that covers some 42,000 sq m – and installing new furniture in the autumn.\nThe work has been “entirely funded” by US$848 million (S$1.1 billion) in donations from France and abroad, Mr Jost said.\n‘Really something else’\nCraftsmen and women from across France have contributed to Notre-Dame’s revival.\nA family carpentry workshop in the village of Hagetmau in south-west France, for example, is particularly proud of its contribution.\nFor its 60th anniversary in 2023, it will be delivering its most prestigious order yet – 1,500 chairs for the cathedral.\n“We’ve already done interesting jobs but this is really something else,” business owner Alain Bastiat told AFP in September.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron initially promised to have Notre-Dame restored within five years, in time for the Paris Olympics.\nBut rebuilding was delayed for months by decontamination efforts, after more than 300 tonnes of lead from the roof melted in the fire.\nAuthorities then had to halt work several times over the first winter due to high winds, before France went into lockdown in early 2020 to fight the spread of Covid-19.\nMr Jost took over the job of overseeing the cathedral’s rebirth after the former French army chief in charge of the renovation, General Jean-Louis Georgelin, died in August during a mountain hike.\nMr Jost had been Gen Georgelin’s right-hand man before the accident.\nMore than five years after the blaze, three investigating judges are still looking into what sparked it.\nAn initial inquiry pointed to it probably being an accident, with an electrical fault or a cigarette among the theories.
