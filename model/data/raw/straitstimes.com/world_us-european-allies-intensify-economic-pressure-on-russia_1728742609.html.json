European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was also working to suspend Russia's membership rights of leading multilateral institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and crack down on its use of crypto-assets.\nA US ban on luxury exports to Russia and its ally Belarus - including high-end watches, vehicles, clothes, alcohol and jewellery - takes effect immediately, the Commerce Department said.\nThe US Congress would need to pass legislation to revoke Russia's trade status, and lawmakers have been moving in that direction. The United States also moved to shut down development funds while announcing a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds, too. The White House said Biden would ban US investment in Russia beyond the energy sector.\nTop US imports from Russia included mineral fuels, precious metal and stone, iron and steel, fertilisers and inorganic chemicals, all goods that could face higher tariffs once Congress acts to revoke Russia's favoured nation trade status.\nThe United States also imposed sanctions on more Russian oligarchs, leaders and elites, targeting members of the lower house of parliament and billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, among others. Those hit with the new sanctions include 10 people comprising VTB Bank's board, 12 members of the Duma and family members of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the US Treasury Department said.\nRussian forces invaded Ukraine last month in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Russia calls the action a \"special operation\".\n\"Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,\" the White House said in a statement.\nThe United States also imposed fresh North Korea-related sanctions, targeting Russian individuals and companies after US and South Korean officials said Pyongyang had used its largest intercontinental ballistic missile system in two recent launches.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/us-european-allies-intensify-economic-pressure-on-russia"}
