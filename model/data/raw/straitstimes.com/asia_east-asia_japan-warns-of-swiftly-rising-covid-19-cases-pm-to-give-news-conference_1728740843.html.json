The BA.5 variant accounts for more than half.\n“Tomorrow, we will hold a meeting... to decide on measures to be taken this summer,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told a meeting, adding that the gathering would weigh expert opinion and the nationwide trend.\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida is scheduled to give a news conference at 6pm (5pm Singapore time) on Thursday.\nAt the event, Kyodo news agency said Mr Kishida was likely to discuss the spread of the disease and ways to tackle inflation stemming from the weak yen and higher fuel prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nLand and transport minister Tetsuo Saito, who also handles tourism, said it was not the time to start a system of support and subsidies for domestic travel.\nJapan launched a travel promotion programme late in 2020 before abandoning it amid criticism that it had helped spread the coronavirus.\nA similar scheme had been widely expected to start sometime this year.\nAmong the infected were officials such as the publicity head of the ruling party, Taro Kono, and Karen Makishima, head of the digital agency.\nDrugmakers Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE have sought health ministry approval for use of their Covid-19 vaccine in children aged six months to four years, the firms said on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-warns-of-swiftly-rising-covid-19-cases-pm-to-give-news-conference"}
