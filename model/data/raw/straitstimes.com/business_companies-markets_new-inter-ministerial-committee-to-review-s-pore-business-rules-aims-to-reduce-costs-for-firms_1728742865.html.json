Shanmugam, Chee Hong Tat, Tan See Leng and Desmond Lee.\nMr Chee said that the committee will engage different groups of businesses to understand some of the challenges they are facing.\n“We will take their feedback and suggestions and discuss with our colleagues from the Government to see how we can make things better,” he added.\nMr Chee noted that initiatives like the AfA on Business Competitiveness serve the same purpose, but the inter-ministerial committee will give them a “bigger push”.\nHe said: “We think it’s important for all ministries and government agencies to embark on this rules review exercise to see how we can make things better for our citizens and businesses.”\nMr Chee also noted that reviewing business regulations will be a “priority item” for the Ministry of Transport. The ministry will collaborate with stakeholders in the land, sea and air transport industries to gather feedback and review these rules, he noted.\nAn example of such a review is the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) reassessing its regulatory requirements for unmanned aircraft light shows. Mr Chee explained that current regulations require a licence for each drone, which becomes impractical for light shows using 1,000 drones or more.\nHe said: “CAAS has obtained this feedback from one of the light show companies, and CAAS agrees that, as part of the pro-business rules review, we can do better and use a different approach.\n“Instead of regulating drone by drone, we will regulate show by show.”\nMr Chee added that the licensing fee for drones will be cut from more than $20,000 to a few hundred dollars for such events in the future.\nAt the briefing, Ms Low and Singapore Business Federation deputy honorary treasurer Mark Lee, who co-chairs the AfA, provided updates on the AfA’s activities.\nMs Low said that the AfA will focus on three key areas – manpower, land and regulatory competitiveness.\n“The AfA is looking at this three-sector pillar, including using this opportunity to strengthen our regulatory competitiveness because it is important to help our businesses, and it is important to reduce complexity in navigating government regulations,” she added.\nMr Lee, who is also a Nominated MP, said that the AfA will likely engage between 80 and 100 companies by the end of the year.\nThe AfA was set up to facilitate engagements between the public and private sectors through industry engagements, focus group discussions and public consultations.\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry notes that the AfA had conducted five engagement sessions with over 60 business leaders, industry partners, union representatives and government agencies as at May 2024. The partnership is expected to run until the end of the year.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/new-inter-ministerial-committee-to-review-s-pore-business-rules-aims-to-reduce-costs-for-firms"}
