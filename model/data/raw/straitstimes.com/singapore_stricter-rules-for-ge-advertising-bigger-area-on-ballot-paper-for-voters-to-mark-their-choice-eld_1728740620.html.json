This can also only be done in specific areas outlined in the Subsidiary Legislation, the ELD said.\nOverseas voting\nUnlike the presidential election in 2023, ballot papers cast at overseas polling stations and postal ballot papers will now be sorted by electoral division, rather than being consolidated, as the upcoming election is a general election.\nInstead of one counting agent for every 5,000 overseas voters, or a minimum of three counting agents per candidate like in the presidential election, the maximum number of counting agents will now be raised to five per political party or independent candidate.\nThis is to take into account the larger number of candidates in a general election, ELD added.\nThe nomination paper will also feature a new section for candidates to provide their names to be printed on the ballot paper, and there will be a new form for them to make a declaration after the election as well.\nIn the form, candidates will have to declare that no foreigners were authorised by them or their election agents to conduct any election activity, and that their election activities were not done under foreign influence.\nCivil Aviation Authority of Singapore director-general Han Kok Juan took over as Returning Officer on April 1.\nThe general election is due to be called by November 2025.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/stricter-rules-for-ge-advertising-bigger-area-on-ballot-paper-for-voters-to-mark-their-choice-eld"}
