But that will make little difference to the ferocity of the wind and height of tidal surges inundating the heavily populated and low-lying coast.\n“It’s a matter of life and death,” US President Joe Biden said on Oct 8. “Evacuate now, now, now.”\nMaking matters worse, Milton comes on the heels of Hurricane Helene, which flooded the same west parts of Florida before wreaking havoc across remote areas of North Carolina and further inland.\n“The last time, the water was up to my hip. So I think this time... I’m going to go ahead, grab my family and go,” 36-year-old pastor Emmanuel Parks said.\nBut time to flee was running out.\nBy the morning of Oct 9, Milton was located 400km south-west of Tampa, generating maximum sustained winds of 249kmh, according to the National Hurricane Centre (NHC).\n“Winds will begin to increase along the west coast of Florida by this afternoon,” the NHC said. “Preparations, including evacuation if told to do so, should be rushed.”\nAirlines put on extra flights out of Tampa, Orlando, Fort Myers and Sarasota, as highways clogged up with escaping traffic and gas stations sold out of fuel.\nBut not all Floridians, who have seen many hurricanes come and go, were expected to obey the evacuation orders.\nMr John Gomez travelled all the way from Chicago to try to save his Florida home. “I think it’s better to be here in case something happens,” the 75-year-old said.\nTampa city Mayor Jane Castor’s warning was brutally stark. “If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die,” she said on CNN.\nPresidential election conspiracy theories\nMr Biden postponed a major trip to Germany and Angola to oversee the federal response.\nWith the presidential election just weeks away, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and some of his far-right Republican allies have turned the twin disasters of hurricanes Helene and Milton into a political football.\nConspiracy theories about government involvement in the weather and disinformation about supposed failure by Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, and the rest of the Biden administration to respond have spread rapidly.\nThis prompted one Republican member of Congress from Florida, Mr Carlos Gimenez, to issue a statement on Oct 9 that said: “Humans cannot create or control hurricanes. Anyone who thinks they can, needs to have their head examined”.\nTrump took a new shot on Oct 9, posting on social media that the response in North Carolina was “totally and incompetently managed by Harris/Biden”.\nMr Biden slammed Trump’s politicisation of the natural disasters as “un-American”.\nMs Harris attacked Trump late on Oct 8, asking: “Have you no empathy, man, for the suffering of other people?”\nGlobal warming factor\nScientists say global warming has a role in intense storms as warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapour, providing additional energy for storms, which exacerbates their winds.\nA report by the World Weather Attribution group published on Oct 9 said Hurricane Helene’s torrential rain and powerful winds were made about 10 per cent more intense due to climate change.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/time-runs-out-in-florida-to-flee-hurricane-milton"}
