The ministry also advises Singaporeans to remain in contact with their families and friends to keep them updated on their safety.\nThose who require consular assistance are advised to contact the Singapore Embassy in Tel Aviv or the 24-hour MFA Duty Office at:\nS’pore Embassy in Tel Aviv\nAddress: 28 HaArba’a Street\nSouth Tower, 19th floor\nTel Aviv 6473926, Israel\nTel: +972-3-7289334\nEmergency tel: +972-5-0697-6188\nE-mail: singemb_tlv@mfa.sg\nMFA Duty Office\nTel: +65-6379-8800/8855 (24-hour hotline)\nE-mail: mfa_duty_officer@mfa.gov.sg", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-should-leave-israel-as-soon-as-possible-through-available-commercial-options-mfa"}
