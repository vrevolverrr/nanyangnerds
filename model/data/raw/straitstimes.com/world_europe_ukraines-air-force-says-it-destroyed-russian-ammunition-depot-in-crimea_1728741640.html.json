He mentioned no extensive damage, except small fires in a forest and damaged cars.\nOver the last two years of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine has carried out multiple air and naval strikes on Russian targets in Crimea and caused significant damage to Moscow's fleet in the Black Sea.\nLately, Ukraine has also intensified targeting of Russian air defence systems on the peninsula.
