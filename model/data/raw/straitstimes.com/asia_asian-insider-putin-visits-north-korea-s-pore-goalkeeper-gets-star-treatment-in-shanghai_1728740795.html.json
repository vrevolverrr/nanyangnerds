While he has largely ignored affairs on the Korean peninsula, Jonathan Eyal looks at how the new mutual defence pact between Moscow and Pyongyang might be a signal of Putin’s intention to play a bigger role in Asia.\nIn the Philippines, vice-president Sara Duterte has resigned from the Cabinet of president Ferdinand Marcos Jr, marking the final nail in the coffin that will break up the union of two of the country’s most powerful political families. With this, Duterte is now free to position herself as an opposition leader. Mara Cepeda reports.\nMeanwhile, former Indonesian presidential candidate Anies Baswedan has secured the backing of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, in what is seen as a major boost for his chances to be re-elected as Jakarta governor during the local elections in November. Wahyudi Soeriaatmadja reports.\nAnd lastly, Singapore national team goalkeeper Hassan Sunny gained a huge following in China after his 11 saves during a June 11 World Cup Asian qualifying match denied Thailand – and granted China – a spot among the final 18. Tan Dawn Wei reports on how he was treated like a star while in Shanghai over the weekend.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/asian-insider-putin-visits-north-korea-s-pore-goalkeeper-gets-star-treatment-in-shanghai"}
