After the grace period, non-compliant businesses face fines of up to HK$100,000 (S$17,250).\nCurrently, plastic food and drink containers can still be sold and used for takeaway, but not for dining in. A second, more stringent phase that bans more plastic items, including table cloths, dental floss and ear plugs, is set to be enforced in 2025.\nSince the ban was announced, many eateries across Hong Kong have replaced their disposable plastic tableware with more eco-friendly options made of paper or bamboo.\nMr Lee’s video came after consumers complained that the paper spoons became soggy, warped, and could no longer be used mere minutes after being dipped into hot soup.\nResidents took to forums online to mock environment minister Tse Chin-wan, after he said he found disposable wooden cutlery sturdier than plastic ones. Users urged him to try drinking milkshake through a paper straw or enjoy a steak with a wooden fork and knife.\nIn supermarkets, confusion reigned when Don Don Donki started packaging sushi in opaque cardboard boxes instead of its usual transparent plastic ones for customers opting to eat at its dining area. Some consumers were unhappy that they could no longer select their sushi based on how it looks.\nThe environment ministry quickly clarified that supermarkets could still package their sushi in plastic for dine-in customers, as the products were considered “takeaway” items. But that created more confusion, with lawmakers criticising the ministry for its conflicting statements and unsatisfactory explanations.\nAccording to media reports, mainland Chinese tourists kicked up a fuss on social media platform Xiaohongshu after five-star hotel Grand Hyatt started charging guests for plastic toiletries like tubes of toothpaste, shower caps and razors, citing the government’s new policy.\nA receptionist at the five-star Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel said that while it was still providing some free plastic amenities within the six-month grace period, the hotel was already offering glass flasks and water dispensers in place of plastic bottles of water, and bamboo-stemmed pens instead of plastic-covered ones, among other eco-friendly measures.\nThings were different at some lower-end hotels.\nAn unhappy Singaporean guest at a three-star Ibis Hotel in Sheung Wan said she was not informed of the plastic ban prior to her arrival in Hong Kong. She was not given a toothbrush, cotton buds, shower cap or bottled water in her room.\n“They didn’t inform me (of the new policy) during check-in at the reception either,” said the woman, who wanted to be known only as Ms Tan. “They just left a note in the room for me to figure it out myself.”\nThe hotel did not respond to a request for comment. The environment ministry said hotels can decide for themselves whether to offer or charge for alternatives, as long as they do not provide free plastic items after the grace period.\nDr Jeffrey Hung, CEO of sustainability non-governmental organisation Friends of the Earth (HK), said hotels have many options to offer eco-friendly amenities without appearing “stingy”, such as providing refillable glass or ceramic containers.\n“While Hong Kong has moved very fast from consultation to legislation in phasing out single-use plastics, the city is already behind on the trend,” Dr Hung told The Straits Times.\nHe noted that Shanghai’s hotels have stopped offering disposable amenities since 2019, and non-degradable single-use plastic tableware has been banned for dine-in in other Chinese cities since 2020.\n“We need to move away from plastics faster, as just 9 per cent of all plastic waste generated globally has been recycled.”\nSo far, more than 80 per cent of Hong Kong’s hotels and retailers inspected by the government have complied with the new policy.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/a-useless-paper-spoon-viral-song-echoes-hk-s-struggle-to-save-environment"}
