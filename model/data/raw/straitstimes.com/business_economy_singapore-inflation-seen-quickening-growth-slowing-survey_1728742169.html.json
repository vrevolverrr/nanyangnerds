The full-year forecast was lowered by 0.2 percentage point to 3.8 per cent, a pace that matches the Ministry of Trade and Industry's forecast of 3 per cent to 5 per cent.\nThe growth outlook for 2023 and 2024 remain unchanged at 3 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively.\n\"We think global headwinds will overwhelm and dampen the reopening tailwind,\" Maybank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said in a report to clients dated May 25. They maintain their below-consensus growth forecast of 2.8 per cent for this year.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-inflation-seen-quickening-growth-slowing-survey"}
