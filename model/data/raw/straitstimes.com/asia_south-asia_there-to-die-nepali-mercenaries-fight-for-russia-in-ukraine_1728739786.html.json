It was not because I wanted to, but my situation forced me to”.\nHe underwent a medical check-up before two months of basic training.\n“I was employed with the government, but I’ve heard there are Nepalis fighting in private forces, too,” he said.\nThe recruits – 15 of them Nepalis – woke at 6am to start the drills.\n“We learnt firing positions, how to make bunkers, and how to target drones,” he said.\nBut “the language is also a problem”, he added. “We cannot understand the instructions they give, and in the battleground, that can be dangerous.”\nSent to the front lines in Ukraine, Mr Sharma’s unit – mostly Russian, with six Nepalis – was ambushed even before they reached Kupiansk in the east.\nExplosions killed several of Mr Sharma’s comrades, and he was wounded in the legs and hand.\n“Sometimes it felt like a movie,” he said.\nHe spent months in hospital before deserting as he neared recovery to seek help from Nepal’s embassy in Moscow.\n“I just couldn’t return” to the front, he said. “So, I took a risk to return to Nepal, thinking I will either go to jail or home.”", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/there-to-die-nepali-mercenaries-fight-for-russia-in-ukraine"}
