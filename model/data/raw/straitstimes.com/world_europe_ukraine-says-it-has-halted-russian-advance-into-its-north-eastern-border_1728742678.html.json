The advance of the enemy in certain zones and localities has been halted,” he added.\nHe said Russian forces were “always trying to create conditions for new advances”, and added that Kyiv’s troops were “trying to stabilise the situation, inflict damage and prevent the enemy from gaining ground”.\nThe Russian advances on two fronts underscore the acute ammunition and manpower shortages crippling the Ukrainian military, which have paved the way for the Kremlin’s army to eat away at Ukrainian territory.
