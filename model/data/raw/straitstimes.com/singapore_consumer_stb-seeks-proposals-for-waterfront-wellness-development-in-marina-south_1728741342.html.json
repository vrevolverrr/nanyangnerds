These will need to appeal to both tourists and residents.\n“The wellness attraction will be one of the key attractions in the precinct when completed, complementing other places of interest such as Gardens by the Bay, Founders’ Memorial in Bay East and Marina Barrage,” said STB.\nThe tender is open to both local and international bidders, and will close on Oct 4.\nWhen asked how the attraction will differentiate itself from offerings in established wellness and resort destinations in the region like Bali and Phuket, STB chief Melissa Ow said it would be “a large-format development, and one which is within the context of Singapore as an urban destination”.\n“It will play to Singapore’s strength of convenience, and have a replete set of offerings related to lifestyle and leisure,” she said.\nThe Marina South Coastal site, which is currently vacant, is approximately the size of six football fields.\nThe development will have a maximum gross floor area of 80,000 sq m, of which no more than 30 per cent – or 10,000 sq m of space, whichever is lower – can be allocated for commercial uses such as restaurants, shops, massage establishments and medical clinics.\nIt cannot be used for hotels, casinos and residences, among other purposes.\nThe site will be leased to the successful developer for 45 years, with the option to extend for 15 years, subject to terms and conditions.\nThe call for tender for the development of the wellness attraction was first announced at STB’s annual Tourism Industry Conference in May.\nMs Ow noted that the global wellness market hit US$5.2 trillion (S$7 trillion) in 2022, and is projected to grow to almost US$8 trillion in 2028.\nA report on Singapore by the non-profit Global Wellness Institute showed that the Republic’s wellness economy was valued at US$16.3 billion in 2022.\nSingapore is also up against more established players in the wellness space.\nThere are “top-draw wellness retreats” in several major tourist destinations such as Switzerland, Thailand and Germany, which often come with stunning views of natural elements like mountains, lakes and beaches, noted experts like Mr Benjamin Cassim, a senior lecturer for the diploma in hospitality and tourism management at Temasek Polytechnic.\nOthers, like Ms Fattimah Ally, a senior lecturer at the School of Hospitality in Republic Polytechnic, said that despite not having these geographical advantages, Singapore benefits from its strong expertise in technology and healthcare.\nMr Cassim said this future, purpose-built wellness attraction in Singapore “can deliver curated wellness experiences and offerings as a competitive differentiator”.\nOne approach could be to offer a “major shopping complex” type of experience where all the offerings are wholly dedicated to wellness-related experiences, services and activities, he said.\nAnother approach, he suggested, is the creation of a full holistic, immersive and one-of-a-kind wellness destination, or a destination within destination, where guests would commit to a three- to 10-day curated experience.\n“These retreat programmes would mean the wellness attraction would have to provide not just the wellness experiences but also accommodation and dining etc... An approach like this would necessitate a single operator being responsible for delivering the wellness destination,” he added.\n“With any of the approaches, there will have to be considerations in areas of comfort, tranquillity, connections with nature, spatial atmosphere, respect of the senses and nourishment.”\nMs Fattimah also suggested the inclusion of on-site accommodation offering holistic wellness programmes, citing the likes of the Chiva-Som resort in Hua Hin, Thailand – a destination spa where visitors need to commit to a programme, depending on the length of stay. Besides accommodation, participants’ activities are also curated.\n“The attraction’s proximity to the coastal area provides opportunities to create aqua-related activities such as kayaking, paddleboarding or aqua yoga classes,” she added. “Our accessibility as a destination within the region, as well as within the country, would also be another advantage that would make Singapore an attractive urban wellness ‘escape’.”\n“With the rising demand for more restorative and wellness-related experiences, we believe Singapore is well-placed to be a leading urban wellness destination that prioritises holistic well-being,” said Ms Carrie Kwik, STB’s World Expo and special projects executive director, on July 5.\nShe added that the tender marks a significant stride towards realising Singapore’s wellness ambitions, leveraging the Republic’s existing strengths in accessibility and technology, and as a strong business hub.\nBesides giving travellers more compelling reasons to extend their stay and spend more in Singapore, Ms Kwik said locals will also get to enjoy the range of wellness offerings to be made available.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/stb-seeks-proposals-for-waterfront-wellness-development-in-marina-south"}
