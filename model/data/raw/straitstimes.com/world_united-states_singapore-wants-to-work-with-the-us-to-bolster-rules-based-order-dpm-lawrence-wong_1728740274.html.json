Not just for one, two years, not just even for the next administration, but for the next 80 years and beyond,” he added.\nIn the hour-long discussion at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a prominent think-tank that invites key South-east Asian leaders to talk about pressing issues before Washington-based policymakers and analysts, Mr Wong fielded wide-ranging questions.\nHow Singapore negotiates the intensifying rivalry between the US and China was a recurring issue raised. Mr Wong said Singapore picks its national interest.\n“From Singapore’s point of view, when we look at this relationship between the US and China, our perspective is that this is not about balancing between America and China.\n“Ultimately, we make decisions based on our own interests. And our national interests will very much be guided by principles of international law. As a small country, we need that rule of law framework to operate.”\nIn some circumstances, Singapore may make decisions that may seem to favour one side over the other, he said.\n“But that doesn’t mean that we are pro-China or pro-America.\n“It simply means that we are pro-Singapore.”\nAsked if China’s “aggression” is the “most acute” in the Indo-Pacific, he said it is a phase of China’s nation-building journey.\n“The Chinese talk about three phases in their nation-building journey. They want to stand up, they want to get rich, and they want to get strong. And I think they are, in their minds, in the ‘get strong’ phase of their nation-building journey, which means they feel that their time has come,” he said, adding that China feels it needs to take its rightful place in the world.\nBut China also knows that it has to play its cards carefully, Mr Wong said.\n“China has to grow its influence without making other countries feel pressured, coerced or squeezed. Because if they do so, I think there will be a backlash against China and that will not be in their national interest. So China will have to learn how to moderate and adjust.”\nMr Wong said there is scope for Singapore to be friends with both China and the US at the same time.\n“From Singapore’s perspective and, certainly, from the perspective of all the countries in South-east Asia, we value the friendship we have with the US. America has been a very good friend for a very long time.\n“China now is also a friend for the countries in South-east Asia. And we would like to stay friends with both. After all, it should be possible to have more than one best friend,” he said to chuckles and applause from the audience.\nMr Wong also met US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Friday, welcoming the continued economic engagement by the US in the region.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/singapore-wants-to-work-with-the-us-to-bolster-rules-based-order-dpm-lawrence-wong"}
