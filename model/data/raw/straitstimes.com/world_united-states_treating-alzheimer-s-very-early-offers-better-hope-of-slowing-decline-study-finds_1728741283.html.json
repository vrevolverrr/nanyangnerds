Many Alzheimer’s experts therefore consider them to be only a first step in a potentially fruitful direction.\n“Whether the harms of these drugs are balanced by their modest clinical benefits will ultimately require more data,” three geriatricians wrote in an editorial published Monday in Jama.\nThree deaths were linked to donanemab in its clinical trial, the study reported.\nThree participants in trials of Leqembi also died, after experiencing brain swelling and bleeding.\nBut Eisai, the Japanese company that makes Leqembi along with the company Biogen, based in Boston, Massachusetts, has said it is unclear if the drug contributed to those deaths because those patients had complex medical issues.\nThe two drugs attack another protein, called amyloid, which clumps into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.\nOver years of study, other anti-amyloid drugs failed to show that targeting amyloid could slow memory or thinking problems.\nAnd the FDA’s decision in 2021 to give a type of conditional approval to the anti-amyloid drug Aduhelm while acknowledging uncertainty about whether it was beneficial generated controversy, congressional investigations and reluctance to prescribe it.\nDonanemab and Leqembi, infusions that are administered intravenously, are the first amyloid-attacking drugs with clear evidence of slowing cognitive decline early in the disease.\nBut some Alzheimer’s experts say the slowing is so modest it is unclear if it will be noticeable to patients and families.\nLeqembi patients, who received infusions every two weeks for 18 months, declined 27 per cent more slowly than patients receiving a placebo – a difference of less than half a point on an 18-point cognitive scale that assesses functions such as memory and problem-solving.\nLilly scientists have estimated that it would take nearly four years for amyloid levels to bump up over the threshold again. It is uncertain whether slowing of decline would continue as amyloid begins accumulating again.\nThe difficulty of predicting if these drugs will be meaningful in daily life is reflected in the experience of a patient in another donanemab trial.\nAbout four years ago, 67-year-old Jim Sirois of Berlin, Connecticut, began having trouble finding words during conversations and would forget which items to buy at the grocery store.\nIn November 2021, Mr Sirois, a former power company electrician, started receiving monthly donanemab infusions in a trial comparing whether the drug clears more amyloid than the drug Aduhelm does.\nHis wife Sue, a former middle school maths teacher, said in an interview arranged by Eli Lilly that donanemab cleared the plaques and that treatment was stopped after about 13 months.\nBut the couple said they do not know if the medicine slowed Mr Sirois’ cognitive decline.\nWhile her husband’s symptoms have not worsened significantly, Mrs Sirois said: “There were some things he could do without problems last summer that he has difficulty doing this summer.”\nMr Sirois is now unable to hook up their pool vacuum or put string into their grass trimmer.\n“He just has a lot of difficulty with planning and anything that has multi steps,” she said.\nEven bowling, an activity he excels at, has been affected.\nHis aim can be less targeted now and, although he recently bowled a perfect game, “his average is probably a good 20 pins lower than it used to be”, she said.\n“I don’t know if the drug has helped him or not,” Mrs Sirois said. “I can’t tell.”\nBut, she added: “Whatever we can do to slow the progression or at least have some hope of slowing the progression is what I would want to do.” NYTIMES", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/treating-alzheimer-s-very-early-offers-better-hope-of-slowing-decline-study-finds"}
