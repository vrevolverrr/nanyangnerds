If any infection is established, a patient may suffer loss of limbs or require major surgery to remove damaged tissue.\nQ: Who is at risk of getting the infection?\nA: Vibrio vulnificus typically occurs in people who have poor immune systems or liver disease, and are exposed to seawater, Dr Vasoo said.\nThe bacterium may also enter a person’s body through injuries such as cuts, and even pricks when preparing seafood, or people who eat undercooked seafood such as oysters, he added.\n“Older men seem to be more affected than women,” Dr Vasoo said.\nAccording to the CDC, about 150 to 200 cases of the infection are reported each year in the US, and around one in five people with the infection dies within one or two days of falling ill.\nQ: Are there local cases of the infection?\nA: Dr Vasoo said that while Vibrio vulnificus is not a reportable infectious disease here, there have been a few local cases noted in medical journals. A reportable infectious disease is one that must be reported to the Ministry of Health once diagnosed by a doctor or confirmed in a laboratory.\nFor instance, a 2005 local medical journal reported that a 37-year-old Chinese man had his right leg amputated below the knee after he ate raw cockles.\nThe man, who had liver disease, had then also recently injured his right foot while getting out of a truck.\nAlthough X-rays did not show any fractures, blisters and early gangrene were observed on his right leg two days after he was admitted to the hospital.\nThe man subsequently underwent the amputation and was discharged after two months.\nIn a more severe case, a 66-year-old Chinese man died from Vibrio vulnificus septicaemia in 1986 just a few days after he complained of fever and chills.\nA local medical journal in 1988 reported that the man’s swollen left leg turned gangrenous the next day. He also had diabetes mellitus and alcoholic liver disease. Doctors noted that his right leg had areas of ischaemia, a condition where blood flow and oxygen are restricted or reduced in a part of the body.\nBoth his legs were then amputated above the knee, but the man died several days later.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-what-is-vibrio-vulnificus-how-common-is-it-in-singapore"}
