On Oct 2, eight Israeli soldiers were killed - the deadliest suffered by Israel's military on the Lebanon front in the past year of border-area clashes between Israel and its Iranian-backed Lebanese foe.\nThe attacks from Lebanon into Israel have been \"destabilising,\" Mr Campbell said, while issuing a warning about sustained conflict with Lebanon.\n\"I think we tried to underscore our support for some of the actions that Israel has taken. I think we have real wariness about a extended or substantial ground set of operations in Lebanon,\" Mr Campbell said.
