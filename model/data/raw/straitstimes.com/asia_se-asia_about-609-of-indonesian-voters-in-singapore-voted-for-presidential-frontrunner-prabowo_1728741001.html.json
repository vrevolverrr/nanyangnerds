This is based on 62.09 per cent of actual ballots counted.\nThe PDI-P had backed Mr Ganjar’s presidential candidacy, while Mr Prabowo was supported by his own Gerindra Party.\nGerindra received 16.89 per cent of the votes from voters in Singapore.\nIn the ongoing real national count tally, the party obtained 13.42 per cent.\nNotably, the youth-centric Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), which is chaired by Mr Widodo’s younger son, Mr Kaesang Pangarep, did better in Singapore than in the national counts.\nThe party received about 14.65 per cent of the votes, significantly higher than the real count tally it has of slightly more than 2.5 per cent.\nMr Kaesang studied in Singapore and his networks with Indonesians there could be a driving factor for PSI’s popularity, Mr Dedi said.\nHe added that the party’s good performance also stems from the influence of its founder, Mr Jeffrie Geovanie, who resides in Singapore and is well-known among Indonesians there.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/about-609-of-indonesian-voters-in-singapore-voted-for-presidential-frontrunner-prabowo"}
