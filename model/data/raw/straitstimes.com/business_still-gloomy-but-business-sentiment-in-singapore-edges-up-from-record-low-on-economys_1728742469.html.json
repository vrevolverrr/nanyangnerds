The figures are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents expecting decreases from the percentage expecting increases.\nThe construction sector - where firms hold the most bleak outlook for the July to September period, with negative indicators across the board - saw new orders, inventory and employment levels each fall to -60 percentage points, compared with -30 percentage points the previous quarter.\nThe two sectors that are moderately upbeat - manufacturing and finance - both recorded three indicators in positive territory.\nFor the manufacturing industry, new orders recovered from -10 percentage points in the second quarter to +5.88 percentage points for the July to September period.\nThe financial sector saw a similar rebound for new orders, coming in at 66.67 percentage points for the third quarter compared with 0 percentage point in the previous three months.\nWhile there is some optimism among firms as the Singapore economy gradually reopens after the circuit breaker period, high levels of uncertainties still remain given the threat of a second wave of coronavirus infections, continued global social unrest, and trade tensions between the United States and China, noted SCCB's Ms Chia.\nWith firms expected to take some time to return to operating at full capacity as they were before the Covid-19 pandemic, the overall sentiment is forecast to remain dampened for the coming months, she added.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/still-gloomy-but-business-sentiment-in-singapore-edges-up-from-record-low-on-economys"}
