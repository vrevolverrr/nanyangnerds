Residents described several explosions.\n“It’s bad, very bad,” said Oleksnadr, 36, outside a supermarket at the time of the attack. “We need to pressure them, get them to leave, maybe more air defence systems would help. This happens often, not only on festive occasions. Every other day.”\nOne rescue worker was killed and four others injured when Russian forces shelled a fire department in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson before the deadline early on Friday, the regional governor said. Reuters could not immediately verify this.\nMr Putin ordered the 36-hour ceasefire in the 10-month-long war in a surprise move on Thursday, saying it would run through to the end of Russian Orthodox Christmas on Saturday.\nChristmas as cover\nBut Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the ceasefire out of hand as a ploy for Russia to buy time after sustaining crippling losses at the front line.\n“They now want to use Christmas as a cover, albeit briefly, to stop the advances of our boys ... and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilised troops closer to our positions,” Mr Zelensky said in his Thursday night video address.\nIn a major breakthrough for Kyiv, this week its Western allies finally announced shipments of large numbers of armoured fighting vehicles, which Kyiv has been requesting for months for mechanised battles against Russian tanks at the front.\nGermany said it would deliver an advanced Patriot anti-aircraft missile system and around 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles within three months. Washington will send Bradley Fighting Vehicles as part of a new US$2.8 billion (S$3.7 billion) security package due to be formally unveiled on Friday. France also announced a package of armoured vehicles.\nUkraine’s military General Staff said its soldiers repelled repeated Russian attacks over the past day, with Moscow focused on trying to take towns in Donetsk.\n“The enemy is concentrating its main efforts on attempts to establish control over the Donetsk region” without success, the General Staff said in a statement, adding that both Ukraine and Russia had launched multiple air strikes over the past day.\nUS President Joe Biden suggested Putin’s ceasefire offer was a sign of desperation: “I think he’s trying to find some oxygen,” he told reporters at the White House.\nRussia’s Orthodox Church observes Christmas on Jan 7. The main Orthodox Church in Ukraine has rejected the authority of Moscow, and many Ukrainian believers have shifted their calendar to celebrate Christmas on Dec 25, as in the West.\nIn his evening speech, Mr Zelensky switched to Russian rather than Ukrainian to address Russians. Ending the war meant “ending your country’s aggression... And the war will end either when your soldiers leave or we throw them out.” REUTERS", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russian-ceasefire-comes-into-force-in-ukraine"}
