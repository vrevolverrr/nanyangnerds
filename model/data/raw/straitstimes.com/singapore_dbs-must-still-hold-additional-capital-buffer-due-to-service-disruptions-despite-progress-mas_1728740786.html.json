Chief executive Piyush Gupta said: “The pause has allowed us to reflect on the areas we needed to improve on, and to better address them... In the months ahead, we will continue to prioritise resources to strengthening technology resiliency.”", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/dbs-must-still-hold-additional-capital-buffer-due-to-service-disruptions-despite-progress-mas"}
