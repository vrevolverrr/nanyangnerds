She eventually killed Jabba with the same chain that tied her to him.\nThe costume had been part of the collection of Mr Richard Miller, a sculptor and jeweller who designed it for Lucas. Mr Miller died in 2022.\nThe slave girl bikini was among the Star Wars memorabilia auctioned off by Heritage Auctions, which bills itself as the world’s largest auctioneer of collectible items.\nA prop from the 1977 film Star Wars: A New Hope – a Y-wing starfighter – was sold for US$1.5 million, making it the second most expensive collectible item from the Star Wars franchise.\nA complete R2-D2 unit used in the series sold for US$2.3 million in 2017.", "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/princess-leia-s-slave-girl-bikini-sells-for-235000-at-online-auction"}
