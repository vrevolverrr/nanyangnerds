Moscow\u2019s troops captured the plant in early March but it is still operated by Ukrainian technicians.\n\u201cWe could potentially reach a situation where the diesel runs out, which would cause an accident involving the damage of the active zones of the reactors, which would cause the expulsion of radioactive substances into the environment,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis would have consequences not only for the territory of Ukraine, but also cross-border consequences,\u201d he said.\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged Ukrainians living near the plant to evacuate.\n\u201cFind a way to get to (Ukrainian) controlled territory,\u201d she wrote on Telegram.\nThe weeks-long crisis around the plant prompted inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to travel to the site last week, braving shelling. Two inspectors have remained at the plant indefinitely.\nIn their report, the IAEA said on Tuesday that the situation was unsustainable and that there would be a risk of disaster unless the shooting stopped. But it did not ascribe blame for the damage or set out a detailed plan for what should happen next.\nThe IAEA report called for the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone, but it did not set out a detailed plan of how that should be brought about and what each side\u2019s responsibilities should be, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told Reuters.\n\u201cThe key part is missing in (IAEA director general) Mr Grossi\u2019s report: There is no definite algorithm of what we must do,\u201d the official, Mykhailo Podolyak, told Reuters.\n\u201cIt says both sides have to negotiate, but it doesn\u2019t say that Russian troops must vacate the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It doesn\u2019t mention a 10-15km demilitarisation area\u201d and it doesn\u2019t include the threat of specific sanctions against Russia, he said.\nRussia was also critical of the report, with President Vladimir Putin saying it failed to say that Ukraine was to blame for shelling on the site. The Russian Foreign Ministry requeste d\u201cadditional explanations\u201d from the IAEA. REUTERS"}
