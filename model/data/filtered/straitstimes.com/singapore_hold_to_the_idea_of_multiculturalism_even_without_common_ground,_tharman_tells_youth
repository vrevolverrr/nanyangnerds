Conference 2023 organised by OnePeople.sg.\nEarlier, they had broken into smaller groups to discuss issues such as casual racism, woke culture on social media and strengthening of local and migrant relations.\nMr Tharman, who recently resigned from politics to run in the presidential election later in 2023, said today\u2019s Singapore faces social and economic issues in a world that is more pluralistic, and that are amplified by social media.\n\u201cAnd some people have very strong views on issues which are different from other people,\u201d said Mr Tharman. \u201cThis is inevitable, (the) question is how we deal with it. How do we ensure that a more pluralistic society, a society with more diverse views, does not become a more divided society?\u201d\nHe said the answer begins with early education, developing the ability to have civic discourse, to listen to each other, understand each other\u2019s differences, and try to find common ground.\nHe added: \u201c...when you can\u2019t find common ground because you really have different views that are not so easily reconciled, accepting those differences but remaining Singaporean together, a diverse group of Singaporeans with so much that is still in common that we believe in multiracialism.\u201d\nA discussion group on the challenges faced by migrant workers in trying to integrate in Singapore raised language, particularly the use of English, as a barrier.\nBrent Matthew, 17, a student ambassador from ITE College East, said: \u201cOne of the things my group agreed on was that in order to further integrate our migrant workers, (we should) form bonds and relationships with them.\u201d\nMr Tharman welcomed the idea of having English language courses for migrants that can be conducted at the community clubs.\nHe challenged Singaporeans to not only step out of their comfort zones, but also to extend their comfort zones.\n\u201cPeople (come) from different walks of life, and very different education levels, different income levels,\u201d said Mr Tharman. \u201cWe need to have that ease of interaction, ease of friendship and make that a much broader comfort zone that makes us Singaporeans.\u201d\nAsked by a student if a racial divide still exists in Singapore, Mr Tharman replied that \u201crace was in the air\u201d in the old days, even if people were not unfriendly.\n\u201cIt was a daily occurrence when I took the bus,\u201d he added. \u201cAs the only one at the bus stop, the bus did not stop for me quite often. That was normal. That was the type of society we were in.\u201d\nBut it is different today, as such \u201cmicroaggression\u201d can be confronted and stamped out, he said.\nSingapore has made some progress in schools where some activities and sports are traditionally mono-ethnic, said Mr Tharman, who is versed in Chinese calligraphy and regards his passion for the art form as part of his identity.\n\u201cWe just stuck with the idea that certain games are for certain ethnic groups, and that\u2019s just become a norm,\u201d he said. In the international sporting arena, however, games are played against different nationalities. \u201cIt can be changed. And I\u2019ve seen schools that are deliberately changing.\u201d\n\u201cBut we should be quite deliberate, not in a quota-based fashion, but in an encouraging way,\u201d added Mr Tharman. \u201cTo make sure that those who are not normally associated with a sport or dance... bring them in and bring them in from young. They will do just as well.\u201d"}
