Analysts had expected US$10.57 billion and US$39.68 billion, respectively, according to LSEG data.\nOn an adjusted basis, Uber reported core earnings of US$1.60 billion, beating estimates of US$1.51 billion.\nRevenue from the company\u2019s ride-sharing segment, its largest, rose 25 per cent to US$6.13 billion, above expectations of US$5.94 billion. Uber\u2019s delivery business reported revenue of US$3.29 billion, compared with estimates of US$3.32 billion.\n\u201cWhile there have been some concerns about consumer spend on restaurants and delivery, we are not seeing any impact today,\u201d Mr Khosrowshahi said, adding that a greater push on groceries through expanded partnerships with Instacart and Costco Wholesale was boosting deliveries.\nUber, however, forecast third-quarter gross bookings \u2013 which include its mobility, delivery and freight segments \u2013 between US$40.25 billion and US$41.75 billion, the midpoint of which was below analysts\u2019 estimates of US$41.26 billion.\nThe company said it expects adjusted core earnings between US$1.58 billion and US$1.68 billion in the third quarter, compared with estimates of US$1.62 billion.\nLyft is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Aug 7.
