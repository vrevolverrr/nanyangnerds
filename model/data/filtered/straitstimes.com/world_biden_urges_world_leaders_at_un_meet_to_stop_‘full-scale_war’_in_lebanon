Even though the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible,\u201d Mr Biden said in his farewell address to the global body.\n\u201cIn fact, (it) remains the only path to lasting security to allow the residents from both countries to return to their homes on the border safely.\u201d\nHe also pushed again for an elusive ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, telling the global body it was time to \u201cend this war\u201d.\nUN Security Council member France called for an emergency meeting on the crisis, as the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Mr Josep Borrell, warned \u201cwe are almost in a full-fledged war\u201d.\n\u201cWe should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink,\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.\nPresident Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, condemned the \u201csenseless and incomprehensible\u201d inaction by the UN against Israel.\nThe United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, has opposed a ground invasion into Lebanon. A senior official said ahead of Mr Biden\u2019s speech that the US would bring \u201cconcrete\u201d ideas for de-escalation to the UN.\nIt is unclear what progress can be made to defuse the situation in Lebanon as the efforts to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, which Israel has relentlessly pounded since October 2023, have come to nothing.\nMr Guterres cautioned against \u201cthe possibility of transforming Lebanon (into) another Gaza\u201d, calling the situation in the embattled Palestinian territory a \u201cnon-stop nightmare\u201d.\n\u2018Charade of hypocrisy\u2019\nIsrael\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Mr Danny Danon, hit back at the UN chief, calling the General Assembly debate an \u201cannual charade of hypocrisy\u201d.\n\u201cWhen the UN secretary-general speaks about the release of our hostages, the UN assembly is silent. But when he speaks about the suffering in Gaza, he receives thunderous applause,\u201d Mr Danon said.\nSince the annual gathering in 2023, when Sudan\u2019s civil war and Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion dominated, the world has faced an explosion of crises.\nThe Oct 7 attack by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Israel and the ensuing violence in the Middle East has exposed deep divisions in the global body.\nMr Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group think-tank said he expects many leaders to \u201cwarn that the UN will become irrelevant globally if it cannot help make peace\u201d.\nWith Israel\u2019s leader, Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas expected to address the General Assembly this week, there could be combustible moments.\nMr Abbas took his seat alongside the Palestinian delegation in alphabetical order for the first time after the delegation received upgraded privileges in the assembly in May.\nOn Sept 24, representatives of Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Iran and Algeria were slated to take the podium to press for a Gaza ceasefire after nearly one year of war.\n\u201cThe level of impunity in the world is politically indefensible and morally intolerable,\u201d Mr Guterres said in his speech to the General Assembly, adding that \u201ca growing number of governments and others feel entitled to a \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 card.\u201d\nUkraine still on the agenda\nUkraine was also on the agenda on Sept 24, when President Volodymyr Zelensky was set to addresses a UN Security Council meeting on the Russian invasion.\nMr Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war has failed at its core aim.\n\u201cHe set out to destroy Ukraine, but Ukraine is still free,\u201d he said.\nIt is unclear if the grand diplomatic gathering can achieve anything for the millions mired in conflict, poverty and climate crisis globally.\n\u201cAny real diplomacy to reduce tensions will take place behind the scenes,\u201d Mr Gowan said.
