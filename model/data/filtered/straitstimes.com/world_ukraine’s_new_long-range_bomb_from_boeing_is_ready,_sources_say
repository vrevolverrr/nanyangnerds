A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment.\nFor the Biden administration, the decision to send the GLSDBs to Ukraine represents an alternative ATACMS missile, which the administration has so far provided in only small numbers.\nUkraine\u2019s supply of ATACMS has been depleted by use.\nThe new glide bombs, while not as powerful, are much cheaper, smaller and easier to deploy than ATACMS, making them well suited for much of what Ukraine hopes to accomplish disrupting Russian operations and creating a tactical advantage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to finding creative means to provide the capability and capacity needed to strike deep and often behind Russian lines,\u201d said Dr Tom Karako, a weapons and security expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.\nWhen Boeing pitched the weapon in 2023, it presented an \u201cexpedited nine-month option\u201d for delivery that required exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible.\nThe Pentagon said publicly that funding was approved in February and a contract to begin production was inked the following month, US officials said.\nBecause GLSDBs have already been paid for, the weapon can avoid the recent congressional funding dispute over continued weapons shipments to Ukraine.\nBoeing, the prime contractor for the weapon, did not respond to a request for comment.
