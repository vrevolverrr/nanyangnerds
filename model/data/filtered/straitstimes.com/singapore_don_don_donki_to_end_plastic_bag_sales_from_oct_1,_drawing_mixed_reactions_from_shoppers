The A4-sized notices urge customers to bring reusable bags and support a greener future. \u201cThank you for your understanding and support,\u201d the message reads.\nWhen The Straits Times visited the Paya Lebar Quarter Mall outlet on Sept 10, many shoppers were seen juggling items in their hands instead of using plastic or reusable bags.\nOf the 12 people ST spoke to, half of them said they are fine with the sale of plastic bags ceasing, as they already have the habit of carrying their own bags since major supermarkets such as FairPrice and Sheng Siong began charging at least five cents for plastic bags in July 2023.\nFrequent customer Adeline Low, 64, a retiree, said: \u201cIt has become a routine for me to carry an additional recyclable bag for a few years now, so I\u2019m not going to be one of those affected.\u201d\nCustomer Shermaine Tan, 30, who works in accounting, feels the same way. She said she uses her own reusable bag when she buys bulky items, like a carton of drinks.\nHowever, some others found the new policy \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201ctroublesome\u201d.\nMr Daniel Quah, 27, said: \u201cWhat commitment to sustainability? Most of their items such as pre-made bento and sushi sets include a lot of plastic packaging.\u201d\nThe corporate analyst said he visits Don Don Donki at least once a week to buy vegetables, fruits and fresh meat. He usually buys two plastic bags from the store on each visit, and carries his own cooler bag for perishable items.\nHe said it is better if the retail chain can still give customers the option of buying plastic bags at checkout, although the price could be increased to 30 cents per bag to discourage usage.\nAnother shopper, who wanted to be known only as Mel Chandan, said: \u201cI think it doesn\u2019t make sense if Don Don Donki uses plastic for advertising (materials) such as brochures, and then charge for plastic bags.\u201d\nThe 25-year-old customer service officer added: \u201cI feel like businesses should practise what they preach if they are trying to promote sustainability.\u201d\nResponding to queries, a Don Don Donki spokesman on Sept 12 said: \u201cAs part of our sustainability efforts, Don Don Donki Singapore will join the other regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Malaysia to stop the sale of plastic bags.\n\u201cMore reusable bag alternatives will be provided.\u201d"}
