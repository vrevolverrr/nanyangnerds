(is) to ensure that there is no false information generated by the system. On top of that, we want to make sure that adequate protection is given to the information that might be uploaded or provided to the system,\u201d said Justice Abdullah.\nHe added that to ensure that those who are not tech-savvy will be able to tap the new program, the courts could explore having volunteers to guide them when the project is rolled out.\nIf the project succeeds, the AI model could be rolled out to other areas like civil claims and divorce maintenance."}
