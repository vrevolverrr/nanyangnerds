Zero-Covid had been abandoned, and the country\u2019s shoppers and tourists allowed to roam free. Yet the rebound has fizzled out, with weak growth and deflation the result. This will affect not only its people. What happens in the world\u2019s second-largest economy matters beyond its borders, too.\nBecause China is so big, its changing economic fortunes can drive overall global growth figures. But a slowing China also directly affects other countries\u2019 prospects. Its households and companies will buy fewer goods and services than they would have otherwise, with consequences for both the producers of these goods and other consumers of them. In some places, China\u2019s difficulties will be a source of pain. In others, though, they will bring relief."}
