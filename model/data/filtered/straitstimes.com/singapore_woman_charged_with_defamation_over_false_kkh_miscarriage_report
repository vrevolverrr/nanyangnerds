His case is pending.\nThe fabricated story had stated that on Feb 28, 2022, the woman, who was 20 weeks pregnant and was Covid-19 positive, arrived at KKH to seek treatment after experiencing severe abdominal pain at 2pm.\nAccording to the article, the woman said she was told to wait at the drop-off area and that she started to bleed at 5pm, but was not attended to.\nShe claimed she saw the doctor only at 6pm after a four-hour wait, and was told she had lost her foetus. She also alleged that her foetus was discarded as medical waste.\nPolice investigations showed that the story and its allegations were false. KKH confirmed that the patient had been seen by a doctor within an hour of her arrival and did not suffer a miscarriage.\nIn March 2022, the Ministry of Health said it had instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office to issue a correction direction to WUSG for publishing the false account.\nCorrection notices were published on WUSG\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts on March 27, 2022.\nWUSG also issued an apology on April 1 that year, stating in a Facebook post: \u201cWe have just learnt that we were lied to at every turn, and the documents sent to us were doctored. We apologise to KKH and all our readers.\u201d\nMa Su Nandar Htwe\u2019s case has been adjourned to May 24.\nOffenders convicted of defamation can be jailed for up to two years and fined."}
