It\u2019s essential,\u201d she added.\n\u2018Nothing will change\u2019\nExperts on Sept 9 had described Pelicot as a self-centred manipulator with no empathy and a split personality.\nHis ex-wife and victim, Ms Gisele Pelicot, 71, says she was troubled by strange memory lapses for years until police uncovered the abuse by chance after he was caught filming up women\u2019s skirts in a local supermarket.\nThe trial is open to the public at her request to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual assault.\nThe family\u2019s attorney, Mr Stephane Babonneau, earlier on Sept 10 said it was \u201cabsolutely necessary that Mr Pelicot be treated medically and be able to attend the debates\u201d.\nMs Gisele Pelicot and her children \u201cdo not wish to testify without him being present,\u201d he added.\nMost of the alleged rapes took place in the Pelicot home in Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in the southern region of Provence.\nPelicot kept meticulous records of the abuse of his wife, discovered after police seized his computer and other equipment.\n\u2018Deep unconscious state\u2019\nAn investigator, who waded through images and footage found on the main defendant\u2019s computer, told the court on Sept 10 that all the co-accused must have known that Ms Gisele Pelicot was unconscious.\n\u201cBeyond the images, you need to listen to the sound. You immediately notice that she\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Mr Stephan Gal said.\n\u201cSome even came back on several occasions, and none could have been unaware that she was in a deep unconscious state.\u201d\nEighteen of the 51 accused, including Pelicot, are in custody, while 32 other defendants are attending the trial as free men.\nThe last one, still at large, is being judged in absentia.\nThe investigator recounted the case of one of the co-defendants, Mathieu D, accused of sexually abusing Ms Gisele Pelicot, like many others without a condom.\nPolice identified him thanks to a distinctive tattoo, Mr Gal said.\nThey found his contact in the main defendant\u2019s telephone, and his phone data showed he was in Mazan on the same day.\nWhen interrogated, Mathieu D \u201csaid he knew Dominique Pelicot was going to put his wife to sleep, but he thought it was part of a \u2018sexual game\u2019. He said it was presented as a scenario and he had naively, blindly gone for it,\u201d Mr Gal said.\nThe main defendant\u2019s daughter, Ms Caroline Darian, 45, has said her life was \u201cliterally turned upside down\u201d when she heard of the abuse.\nPhotomontages of her naked had also been found on her father\u2019s computer.\nThe couple\u2019s two sons are still due to speak.
