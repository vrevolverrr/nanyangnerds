We will always be there by your side.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone who wants peace and justice must condemn Hamas\u2019 reign of terror,\u201d Mr Blinken said. \u201cWe know Hamas doesn\u2019t represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice opportunity and dignity.\u201d\nSpeaking on personal terms, he said, \u201cI come before you not only as the United States Secretary of State but also as a Jew\u201d, and \u201cas a husband and father of young children\u201d.\n\u201cIt is impossible for me to look at the photos of families killed, such as the mother, father and three small children murdered as they sheltered in their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and not think of my own children,\u201d he added.\nHe disclosed that at least 25 Americans were killed in Israel, up from the 22 confirmed by US officials on Wednesday.\nSpeaking to a roundtable of Jewish community leaders in Washington, Mr Biden said his deployment of military ships and aircraft closer to Israel should be seen as a signal to Iran, which backs Islamist groups Hamas and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah.\n\u201cWe made it clear to the Iranians: Be careful,\u201d he said.\nIran likely knew Hamas militants were planning \u201coperations against Israel\u201d but initial US intelligence reports showed that some Iranian leaders were surprised by the group\u2019s unprecedented attack from Gaza, US sources said on Wednesday.\n\u2018We are all soldiers of Israel\u2019\nIsrael\u2019s leaders on Wednesday formed a unity government, promising to put bitter political divisions aside to focus on the fight against Hamas.\nFormer defence minister Benny Gantz, a centrist opposition leader, spoke live on Israeli television alongside Mr Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant after forming a war Cabinet focused entirely on the conflict.\n\u201cOur partnership is not political, it is a shared fate,\u201d said Mr Gantz. \u201cAt this time, we are all the soldiers of Israel.\u201d\nMr Netanyahu said the people of Israel and its leadership were united. \u201cWe have put aside all differences because the fate of our state is on the line,\u201d he said.\nMr Gantz\u2019s National Unity Party, which has fiercely opposed judicial reforms proposed by Mr Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition, said it will not promote any unrelated policy or laws while the fighting goes on.\nIsrael has put Gaza under \u201ctotal siege\u201d to stop food and fuel reaching the enclave of 2.3 million people, many poor and dependent on aid. Hamas media said on Wednesday that electricity went out after the only power station stopped working.\nA group of independent UN experts on Thursday condemned violence against civilians in Israel, but they also deplored the \u201ccollective punishment\u201d of reprisal strikes against Gaza.\nWhile condemning the \u201chorrific crimes committed by Hamas\u201d, the group said Israel has resorted to \u201cindiscriminate military attacks against the already exhausted Palestinian people of Gaza\u201d.\n\u201cThis amounts to collective punishment,\u201d the group, which includes several UN special rapporteurs, said in a statement.\n\u201cThere is no justification for violence that indiscriminately targets innocent civilians, whether by Hamas or Israeli forces,\u201d they said.\nThe group said taking hostages in the context of hostilities also constituted a war crime.\n\u201cThe civilians taken by Hamas must be immediately released, pending which their fate and whereabouts must be disclosed,\u201d the experts said.\nIsrael\u2019s chief military spokesman, Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Israel was able to confirm the identities of 97 people taken hostage into Gaza."}
