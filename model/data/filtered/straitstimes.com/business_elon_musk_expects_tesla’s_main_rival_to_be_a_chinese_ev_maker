Other automakers have also announced cuts to get a better hold in the world\u2019s biggest EV market, including local players such as Xpeng and Aito, which is backed by Huawei Technologies.\nChina\u2019s leading EV maker is BYD, which outsold Tesla in 2022 when its plug-in hybrid vehicles as well as pure EVs were included.\nMr Musk said on Wednesday\u2019s call that China is the most competitive market. He has made similar comments before, including during an online forum in September 2021, when he said he had \u201ca great deal of respect for the many Chinese automakers\u201d.\nTesla made more than 710,000 EVs in China last year, about 52 per cent of its global output, even with production being disrupted by the country\u2019s now-abandoned zero-Covid policy. Mr Musk said 2022 was difficult due to shutdowns at Tesla\u2019s China factory, along with higher borrowing costs and logistical issues.\nWithout unexpected disruptions, worldwide output could approach two million vehicles this year, he said.\nBloombergNEF expects Tesla\u2019s sales to grow by up to 40 per cent in 2023 and its Model Y to be the best-selling EV in the world, likely making it into the top three models of any type.\nTesla\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter was US$24.3 billion (S$31.9 billion), ahead of market expectations, while it reported adjusted earnings of US$1.19 a share, topping the US$1.12 average forecast from analysts.
