{"title": "Big currency flop of 2023, the yen is top pick for year ahead again", "tags": "business", "timestamp": "2023-12-18", "content": "TOKYO \u2013 Three straight years of outsized declines in the yen look set to end in 2024.\nThat is the view of market participants polled by Bloomberg, who on balance see the currency rallying in 2024 as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) exits the world\u2019s last negative interest rate regime and its global peers cut borrowing costs.\nWhile projections for a 2023 yen rebound started going wrong as early as February, forecasters see key differences this time around.\nA year ago, traders were speculating that a new chief at the BOJ might unwind ultra-easy monetary policy.\nNow they are aligned with economists who say a shift will come within months, and the central bank\u2019s own leadership has publicly discussed the implications of a future exit.\n\u201cThe situation won\u2019t disappoint the yen bulls on this occasion,\u201d said Mizuho Securities strategist Shoki Omori, who sees the prolonged slump in the currency coming to an end. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room for the BOJ to tighten policy, but they do seem determined to rip up negative interest rates.\u201d\nThe picture outside Japan also looks clearer than it did 12 months ago. Whereas traders in 2022 were talking about US interest rates likely peaking in 2023, projections in December from Federal Reserve policymakers point to 75 basis points of cuts in 2024.\nThe median of forecasts compiled by Bloomberg indicates the yen will strengthen to 135 versus the US dollar by the end of 2024, as the wide interest gap between the United States and Japan narrows. Their overly bullish projection about a year ago was for the pair to trade around 131 at the end of 2023.\nThe yen was trading at 142.43 at 9.16am in Tokyo on Dec 18.\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve ultimately rose by 100 basis points in 2023, while the Bank of Japan maintained its negative key rate, which was a major headwind for the yen,\u201d said Mr Spencer Hakimian, chief executive of Tolou Capital Management in New York. He sees the \u201creverse scenario\u201d playing out in 2024 and expects the yen to reach about 135 by the end of the year.\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield, which has been a major driver of the dollar-yen\u2019s direction in 2023, has dropped about 50 basis points over the past month, setting the scene for a change in the currency market.\n\u201cIt does seem that bond yields have now peaked, the Fed has finished hiking and the dollar has further to fall in 2024,\u201d said Mr Kit Juckes, chief foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale in London.\n\u201cThe yen should make substantial gains.\u201d\nYet, there is still room for a lot of volatility. The yen rallied almost 4 per cent in just one day earlier in December amid a short-lived spike in bets that the BOJ would hike rates at the conclusion of its Dec 18 to 19 meeting. It reversed course over the following two days before strengthening again.\nPolicy gatherings in Tokyo in January and March provide more triggers for speculation in the build-up to an April decision in 2024 that is seen by a majority of BOJ watchers as the most likely time for change.\nWhile inflation has remained above the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target for more than 1\u00bd years, officials appear keen for more evidence of solid wage growth, which may come during pay negotiations early in 2024.\n\u201cWe believe that there is sufficient longer-term structural improvement in the economy,\u201d said Mr Steven Barrow, London-based head of Group of 10 strategy at Standard Bank, which has a one-year forecast of 125 for the yen.\nMr Barrow sees the currency appreciating over the longer term, regardless of whether rate differentials narrow.\nHe cited positive change in Japan, including the end of deflation and the stock market rally. The benchmark Tokyo Stock Price Index equity gauge has soared about 23 per cent so far in 2023. BLOOMBERG"}
