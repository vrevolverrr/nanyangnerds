More pet owners have been promoting my online shop after I installed the machines,\u201d said Mr Sam.\nAnother online retailer, Pitstop Detailz, which sells automotive care products, has five vending machines in carparks across Singapore, with a sixth set to launch in September.\nIts director, Mr Emmanuel Maniam, said the machines have allowed his business, which previously operated on Carousell, to save time spent on packing and sending out orders.\n\u201cAfter installing our first machine in 2021, we observed considerable demand for such a concept, and customers began using our Carousell page more as a catalogue before coming down to pick the items up from the machines,\u201d the 31-year-old said.\nMr Kegan Tan, director of Spartan Sports, which sells sporting goods online, added that vending machines are a relatively low-cost way for online businesses to have a physical presence.\n\u201cVending machines became a way for us to create an offline presence that generates traffic to our online store and e-commerce platform pages,\u201d said Mr Tan, 37, who owns three machines that he has rotated among malls, bus stops and residential areas.\nLe Tach\u2019s Mr Chia said vending machines could become a bigger part of the retail scene here.\n\u201cVending machines used to offer products that are impulse buys. But increasingly we are seeing people go down to vending machines intentionally for things that they need,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis could be the way forward for many businesses, online or offline.\u201d"}
