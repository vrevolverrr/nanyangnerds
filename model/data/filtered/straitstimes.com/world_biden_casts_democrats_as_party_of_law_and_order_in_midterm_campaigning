In his recent speeches, he has launched increasingly direct attacks on Republicans - a departure from his pre-presidency persona, which earned him some criticism of being \u201ctoo bipartisan\u201d and having \u201ctoo many Republican friends\u201d, he quipped on Tuesday.\nMr Biden touted his plan to make America safer and his support for legislation to fund the police and reduce gun crime, a major concern of voters.\nHe also highlighted the bipartisan gun safety Bill Congress passed in June, its first major legislation on the issue in nearly 30 years, and slammed most Republican lawmakers for voting against it.\nThe President\u2019s speech comes after several high-profile mass shootings over the summer, including one in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, in May that killed 19 children and two adults.\nCalling for a ban on assault rifles, Mr Biden said that to identify the bodies of their slain children, some parents had to supply DNA because of the damage the high-powered weapons had done.\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, what is the rationale for these weapons outside of a war zone?\u201d said Mr Biden, visibly angry. \u201cDNA to say, that is my baby? What is the matter with us?\u201d\nHe cited recent research in the New England Journal of Medicine, which found that guns had overtaken car accidents in 2020 to become the leading cause of children\u2019s death in America.\nUS gun deaths surged in 2020 to their highest point since 1994, according to a report by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in May.\nMr Biden vowed to fund police officers, distancing himself from the call by the progressive wing of his party to \u201cdefund the police\u201d, which Republicans have targeted.\n\u201cWhen it comes to public safety, the answer is not to defund the police but fund the police,\u201d he said.\nThe city of Wilkes-Barre, which hosted Mr Biden\u2019s rally, will also be visited on Saturday by former president Donald Trump. Neither has yet officially announced another run for the White House in 2024.\nMr Biden will return to the state on Thursday, when he will give an address on the threat some Republicans pose to America\u2019s democracy, and again on Monday to attend a Labour Day event.\nOn Tuesday, he blasted a wing of the Republican Party for undermining law and order, a pointed attack on its traditional claim as \u201cthe party of law and order\u201d.\n\u201cLet me say this to my MAGA Republican friends in Congress: Don\u2019t tell me you support law enforcement if you don\u2019t condemn what happened on the sixth,\u201d Mr Biden said.\nHe was referring to former president Trump\u2019s \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) campaign slogan and the reluctance of his loyalists to decry the attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on Jan 6 last year.\nHe also criticised threats made against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and its officers who had executed a search warrant at Mr Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida.\n\u201cThere is no place in this country - no place - for endangering the lives of law enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to defunding the police. I\u2019m also opposed to defunding the FBI,\u201d Mr Biden said."}
