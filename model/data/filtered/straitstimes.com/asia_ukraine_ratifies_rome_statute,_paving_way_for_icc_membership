Russia has denied targeting civilians.\n\u201cUkraine has already worked effectively with the ICC to ensure comprehensive accountability for all Russian atrocities committed in the course of Russian aggression,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on social media platform X.\n\u201cThis work will now be even more effective.\u201d\nIn an interview with Reuters in June, senior presidential adviser Iryna Mudra said the ratification process had been held up because of a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d falsely suggesting Ukrainian troops would be more vulnerable to prosecution.\nMr Kuleba also described Kyiv\u2019s bid for ICC membership as \u201ca long journey full of challenges, myths, and fears. None of them have been true\u201d.\nLawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said deputies had been presented with letters of support from Ukraine\u2019s General Staff and the head of Kyiv\u2019s military intelligence before voting.
