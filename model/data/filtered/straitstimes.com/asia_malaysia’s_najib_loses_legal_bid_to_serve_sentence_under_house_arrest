The verdict was upheld by Malaysia\u2019s top court in 2022.\nMalaysian and US investigators estimate that US$4.5 billion (S$6.1 billion) was stolen from 1MDB and more than US$1 billion channelled to accounts linked to Najib.\nThe pardons board in February said Najib was expected to be released in August 2028, six years after he began serving his sentence. It also reduced fines imposed on the former premier, sparking an uproar in Malaysia. Najib, who is also considering filing a new petition for a full pardon, remains on trial for corruption in several other 1MDB-linked cases. REUTERS"}
