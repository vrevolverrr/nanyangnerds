As this was the first time that the water level had seen such a significant drop, HDB is looking into the cause,\u201d HDB told The Straits Times.\nBy the end of February, the fish will be relocated to a commercial farm, which HDB said it has found.\nResidents and public transport users had complained about the foul smell from nearly a hundred dead fish in the receding pond at 81 Lorong Chencharu as early as last week.\nWhen ST visited the site on Feb 5, the stench from the fish carcasses wafted to a nearby bus stop about 20m away.\nWhen ST revisited the spot on Feb 6, all the dead fish were gone and the water in the pond had been topped up. However, the foul smell could still be detected at the bus stop. More than 20 black trash bags, believed to contain dead fish cleared from the pond, were found next to the pond.\nThe once-popular fishing pond \u2013 operated by Fishing Paradise in what used to be Orto leisure park \u2013 was taken over by HDB for soil investigation and survey works in July 2023. The 5.15ha leisure park \u2013 located within a plot of 70ha of land \u2013 is zoned for residential use.\nOrto relocated to the western part of Singapore after the expiration of its tenancy on June 30, 2023.\n\u201cSince then, HDB has been maintaining the site, including the pond and its fishes which have been retained to prevent mosquito breeding, pending the commencement of site clearance and earthworks in the first quarter of 2024,\u201d said HDB."}
