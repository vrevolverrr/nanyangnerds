It will use a full-scale replica of the sampling area based on exploration results on the environment, rock distribution and lunar soil conditions around the landing site.\nChina\u2019s lunar strategy includes its first astronaut landing around 2030 in a programme that counts Russia as a partner.\nIn 2020, China conducted its first lunar sample return mission with Chang\u2019e-5, retrieving samples from the Moon\u2019s nearer side.\nThe US Artemis programme envisions a crewed Moon landing by late 2026 or later. Nasa has partnered with space agencies including those of Canada, Europe and Japan, whose astronauts will join US crews on an Artemis mission.\nArtemis relies heavily on private companies, including Mr Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, whose Starship rocket aims this decade to attempt the first astronaut landing since Nasa\u2019s final Apollo mission in 1972.\nOn June 1, Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa cancelled a private mission around the Moon he had paid for, which was to have used SpaceX\u2019s Starship, citing schedule uncertainties in the rocket\u2019s development.\nBoeing and Nasa postponed the company\u2019s first crewed launch of Starliner, a long-delayed capsule meant to become the second US space taxi to low-Earth orbit.
