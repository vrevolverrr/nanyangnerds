{"title": "Forum: Address littering at Kranji Reservoir Park", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2024-08-22", "content": "I visited Fishing Ground A at Kranji Reservoir Park on Aug 19 and was very disappointed to see the amount of rubbish strewn everywhere despite dustbins available nearby.\nThis poses a health risk as well as a risk to wildlife ingesting the rubbish. Why can\u2019t everyone just bin their trash before leaving? While I am sure that the relevant authorities will efficiently clean up the place, it represents an unnecessary drain on resources.\nThere is a need to take effective action to address this problem through stricter enforcement of anti-littering laws as well as conducting community outreach programmes to raise awareness of this potential hygiene and social problem.\nHaving someone to patrol the area would be helpful."}
