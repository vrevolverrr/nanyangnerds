The properties, 10C and 10E on Black\u2019s Link, are linked to Mr Hui via his associate Tan Haijun, who is listed as a director of the companies holding the houses.\nMr Hui has seen his wealth evaporate and his freedom curtailed as creditors look to salvage what\u2019s left of his property empire. Evergrande, the world\u2019s most indebted developer, is at the centre of a credit crisis that has rippled through China\u2019s real estate sector and slowed the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nThe owner of the two mansions pledged the assets to Orix Asia for a HK$821 million (S$141 million) mortgage loan in late 2021, filings show.\nThe properties, which are valued at more than HK$1.5 billion, will be formally seized within days, local media HK01 reported earlier.\nMr Hui had another house on Black\u2019s Link taken by a bank last year. The creditor has been marketing the property overlooking Victoria Harbour for HK$880 million, but is struggling to find a buyer in a weak real estate market."}
