Shortly after the attacks on the bases, Russia sent a barrage of missiles streaking toward Ukrainian cities.\nThe Kremlin said the weapons launched by Ukraine were Soviet-era jet drones and were aimed at bases in Ryazan and Engels, about 480km from the Ukrainian border. It said that its forces had intercepted the drones, and that \u201cthe fall and explosion of the wreckage\u201d had \u201cslightly damaged\u201d two planes, killing three servicemen and wounding four others.\nThe Engels airfield, on the Volga River in southern Russia, is a base for some of Russia\u2019s long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, including the Tupolev-160 and Tupolev-95. Ukrainian officials say it is also a staging ground for Russia\u2019s unrelenting campaign of missile attacks on infrastructure, which have left millions of Ukrainians with intermittent light, heat or water \u2013 or none at all \u2013 at the onset of winter. Security footage from an apartment complex near the base showed a fireball lighting up the sky.\nThe other explosion occurred at the Dyagilevo military base in the central city of Ryazan, only about 100 miles from Moscow, according to Russia\u2019s defense ministry. It was there that the fatalities and injuries occurred, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\nUkraine\u2019s government declined to publicly acknowledge the strikes, in keeping with its practice with other attacks on Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea.\nThe Engels air base and the Ryazan military installation are between 300 and 450 miles from the Ukrainian border, which is beyond the range of any known missile in Ukraine\u2019s arsenal.\nEven before Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry accused Ukraine of sending drones to attack, the blast at the Engels airfield had prompted some of Russia\u2019s influential pro-invasion bloggers to call for more strikes against Ukraine, and to renew criticism of the Russian armed forces.\n\u201cSometimes we feel that even if you put a bomb into these people\u2019s pockets \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t notice anyway,\u201d Mr Voenniy Osvedomitel, a popular commentator, wrote on the messaging app Telegram.\nAfter the explosions, Mr Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, appeared to note the strikes obliquely, as Ukrainian officials have often done after unexplained explosions inside Russia.\n\u201cThe Earth is round \u2013 discovery made by Galileo,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cIf something is launched into other countries\u2019 airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point.\u201d\nOnly a few hours after the explosions, Ukrainian officials said that more than a dozen Russian bombers had taken off from the Engels air base.
