He has been missing since Israeli forces entered Khan Younis, she said, \u201cand we have been searching for him, but to no avail\u201d.\n\u2018Woke up to a nightmare\u2019\nMr Netanyahu, in a video statement on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover, said Israel \u201cwill deliver additional and painful blows\u201d to Hamas.\n\u201cIn the coming days, we will increase the military and political pressure on Hamas because this is the only way to free our hostages,\u201d he added.\nIsrael estimates that 129 captives remain in Gaza after the Oct 7 Hamas attack, including 34 who the military says are dead.\nThe army has said at least some of the hostages are held in Rafah, which has so far been spared an Israeli invasion and where most of Gaza\u2019s 2.4 million people have sought shelter.\nIsraeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement that \u201cthe chief of staff has approved the next steps for the war\u201d, without offering details.\n\u201cOn Passover, it will be 200 days of captivity for the hostages... We will fight until you return home to us,\u201d he said.\nLast week, the Group of Seven developed economies said they opposed a \u201cfull-scale military operation\u201d in Rafah, fearing \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for civilians.\nIsraeli forces have already carried out regular air strikes on the city.\nThe civil defence agency said Israeli strikes hit two homes in Rafah overnight, killing at least 16 people, mostly children.\nResident Umm Hassan Kloub, 35, said her children screamed when they \u201cwoke up to a nightmare of an explosion\u201d.\n\u201cEvery second we live in terror. Even the sound of Israeli aircraft doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d she said.\nHamas\u2019 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\nIsrael\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,097 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory\u2019s Health Ministry.\nUS boosts Israeli defences\nViolence has also flared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a two-year surge in clashes has further escalated since the Gaza war broke out.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said on April 20 that at least 14 people were killed during a 40-hour Israeli raid on the Nur Shams refugee camp in the northern West Bank.\nOn April 21, two Palestinians were killed during an Israeli raid near Hebron, and another at a northern West Bank checkpoint, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The military said all three had tried to attack troops.\nMeanwhile, Hamas\u2019 military wing said its militants in southern Lebanon fired 20 rockets at a northern Israeli military base, the latest in cross-border exchanges of fire that have usually involved Hamas ally Hezbollah.\nThe Israeli army announced on April 21 the death of a soldier wounded in a Hezbollah strike on April 17 near the Lebanese border.\nMuch of the new military assistance approved by the US House of Representatives on April 20 was expected to be used to reinforce Israel\u2019s air defences.\nIt comes after almost all of the hundreds of missiles and drones that Iran launched towards the country a week ago were intercepted, according to the Israeli military, with the help of Israel\u2019s allies.\nIran\u2019s first-ever direct attack on Israel was itself retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike on Tehran\u2019s embassy consular annex in Damascus.\nIsrael\u2019s response appeared to come on April 19 when explosions were reported in the central Iranian province of Isfahan, though fears of a wider war eased after Iran appeared to downplay the situation.\nIsraeli officials have made no public comment, while Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Tehran would not respond unless there was a further Israeli attack.\nOn April 21, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the \u201csuccess in recent events\u201d of his country\u2019s armed forces, in his first comments since the drone and missile attacks on Israel.
