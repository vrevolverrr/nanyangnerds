JPMorgan and HSBC Holdings raised Cathay to the equivalent of buy from neutral last month, citing earnings growth on resilient travel demand.\nCitigroup downgraded SIA to sell from buy last month, saying the positive earnings outlook is priced in.\nCathay is trading at a price-to-book ratio of 1.3 times, cheaper than SIA at 1.5 times, according to Bloomberg data. Analysts\u2019 12-month target price suggests 18 per cent upside for Cathay from its last closing price, while SIA is already trading above the consensus projection.\nThere are some signs that Cathay\u2019s rally may take a breather. Its shares were in overbought territory this week based on the 14-day relative strength index. The put-to-call ratio, which measures the level of interest in bearish options relative to bullish contracts, has started to edge higher after touching March lows.\nBut analysts betting on an earnings revival are optimistic.\n\u201cWe expect the carrier to deliver more positive surprises in the near-term as consensus estimates appear muted,\u201d said Mr Jason Sum, an analyst at DBS Bank.\n\u201cWe do expect more upside from here on.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
