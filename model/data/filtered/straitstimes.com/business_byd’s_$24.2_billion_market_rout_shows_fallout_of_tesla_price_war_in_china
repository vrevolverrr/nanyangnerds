In comparison, a gauge of global EV makers fell 9 per cent.\nTraders are growing wary about BYD\u2019s prospects after the EV maker\u2019s dealers slashed prices of some models to boost sales. The change in sentiment underscores the wave of caution that is sweeping the industry following moves by Nio and XPeng to follow Tesla\u2019s lead in lowering prices as demand slows.\n\u201cA gradual industry shift is under way as excessive price cuts can lead to buyers holding back, awaiting even lower prices, while also having an excessively negative impact on margin for all players,\u201d said Mr Robert Mumford, an investment manager at GAM Hong Kong. \u201cLower input prices to date are not likely to offset a negative hit to margins.\u201d\nInvestors are now sifting through the pile of stocks to determine the likely winners and losers of the price war, Mr Mumford added.\nIn this respect, some say Shenzhen-based BYD may hold up relatively well as it has better pricing power and controls most of its supply chain by producing its own chips and batteries.\n\u201cSome players may have to undergo cash burn for market share gains and improved scale effect, which will lead to intensified competition and market consolidation,\u201d Citigroup analysts wrote in a note. \u201cOver the long term, we believe market consolidation will further strengthen BYD\u2019s market share.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
