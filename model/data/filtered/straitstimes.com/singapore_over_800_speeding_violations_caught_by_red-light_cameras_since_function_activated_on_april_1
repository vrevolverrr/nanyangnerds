Violations are detected when a vehicle passes over the loop.\nDSP Foo said: \u201cSince (their) operationalisation on April 1 this year, the cameras have detected over 800 speeding violations. This is of concern. We will continue to step up on our enforcement and will not hesitate to take action against errant motorists who choose to flout traffic rules.\u201d\nDSP Foo said the Traffic Police use at least six different types of cameras to detect violations, which are typically processed within two to three weeks.\nWhen a camera detects a violation, an officer manually reviews it to verify its validity and accuracy before a violation report is created.\nA notice of traffic offence may then be issued to the offender, depending on the investigation. Appeals are handled by a different team.\nIn more serious cases, an offender may be arrested, charged in court, and have his licence suspended immediately.\nDSP Foo added that the Traffic Police conduct operations regularly, and offences may be detected by the cameras or in the course of investigations.\nHe said that deciding on which offence to invoke would depend on the case.\n\u201c(It) depends on the facts and circumstances,\u201d he added. \u201cFor example, an offence of dangerous driving could be made out if a vehicle weaves in and out of traffic recklessly at high speed.\u201d\nMuhammad Syafie Ismail, 42, the car driver involved in a six-vehicle crash in Tampines that killed two people on April 22, faces three charges involving dangerous driving and one for failing to stop after an accident.\nWhen asked about the fatal crash, DSP Foo said he was unable to comment as the case was before the courts.\nSingapore\u2019s roads have become increasingly deadly in recent years, with the number of fatalities from accidents in 2023 surging to 136, an almost 26 per cent jump from 108 in 2022.\nAmong the fatalities, motorcyclists and their pillion riders accounted for half of this figure, while elderly pedestrians made up nearly 20 per cent.\nAnd while the number of speeding violations detected by traffic enforcement cameras fell by almost 29 per cent from 73,152 cases in 2022 to 52,237 cases in 2023, the number of speeding violations detected during police enforcement operations increased by 22 per cent, from 52,016 cases in 2022 to 63,468 cases in 2023.\nAt the release of the annual TP figures in February 2024, the Traffic Police said the statistics show that there are many motorists who have irresponsible driving behaviours.\nAn increase in the composition sums and demerit points for certain traffic offences is expected to be announced in the second half of 2024."}
