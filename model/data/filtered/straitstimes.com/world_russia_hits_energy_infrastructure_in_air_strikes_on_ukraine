Power cuts are regularly announced during peak evening consumption hours.\nAn industrial facility was attacked in the western region of Ternopil region during the latest bombardments, and a fuel reservoir was hit, officials said.\nUkrainian television showed huge columns of black smoke rising over Ternopil, and regional authorities urged people to stay indoors.\nMr Viktor Ustenko, a deputy head of the Ternopil regional administration, said more than 90 firefighters were involved in efforts to extinguish the fire.\n\u201cThe situation is fully under control,\u201d Mr Ustenko said.\nAn attack on the capital Kyiv was repelled without major damage or casualties, officials said.\nThere was no immediate comment from Moscow about the attacks on Aug 20. Both sides say they target facilities key to the military and not civilian infrastructure, but many civilians have been killed in the war.\nMoscow has continued air strikes since Ukrainian forces began an incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region on Aug 6, and Russian forces have been gradually advancing in parts of eastern Ukraine.
