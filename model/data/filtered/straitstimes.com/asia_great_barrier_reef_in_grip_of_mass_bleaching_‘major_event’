The longer the exposure and the hotter the water, the greater the risk of bleaching and death of corals.\n\u201cThis is already a major event, larger in extent than any other, with accumulated heat stress that will next week exceed all earlier bleaching events,\u201d said leading reef scientist Terry Hughes from James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland.\nAerial surveys spanning two-thirds of the marine park confirm that a widespread coral bleaching event is under way along the 2,300km reef, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said on March 8. The warning signs have been flashing for weeks. Satellite readings have shown abnormally high sea-surface temperatures along the southern, central and northern portions of the reef this summer. The southern section is the most affected, with current temperatures of around 28.1 deg C, about 1.8 deg C above normal.\n\u201cThe results are consistent with what we have seen with above average sea-surface temperatures across the marine park for an extended period of time,\u201d said Dr Roger Beeden, chief scientist at the Reef Authority, the government agency managing the reef.\nThe surveys looked mainly at the inshore, midshore and shallow offshore reefs. More surveys need to be done to assess the severity of bleaching on deeper water parts of the reef, the authority said.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is built by hundreds of different coral species, many of which are sensitive to small increases in sea temperature. Because of climate change, summer water temperatures and extreme marine heatwaves have been increasing, and the corals have struggled to adapt.\nWhen stressed by prolonged exposure to abnormally high water temperatures, corals expel the photosynthetic algae that both give them their colour and provide them with food.\nCorals can recover if water temperatures quickly return to normal after a few weeks. But prolonged exposure over many weeks makes this less likely, and this can lead to widespread death of some coral species.\nLoss of the coral reef habitat can lead to the extinction of certain marine species and disrupt fisheries, while reef degradation means that shorelines have less of a buffer against waves, storms and floods.\nDuring back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, up to half of all shallow water corals in the northern and central sections died.\n\u201cClimate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef, and coral reefs globally,\u201d Dr Beeden said.\nThe bleaching is the latest to occur globally over the past year, with widespread coral deaths in Florida and the Caribbean in 2023.\nThe United States\u2019 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said the world is on the verge of a fourth mass coral bleaching event affecting vast stretches of tropical reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to a Reuters report on March 5.\nCorals in the waters around Singapore currently show no heat stress, but the NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch site shows swathes of the world\u2019s tropical ocean belt facing elevated sea-surface temperatures.\nMore frequent bleaching events underscore the pressing urgency of the challenges faced by the Great Barrier Reef.\nProf Hughes said the Great Barrier Reef is now a chequerboard of reefs with different recent histories of coral bleaching. Reefs that bleached in 2017 or 2016 have had just five to six years of partial recovery \u2013 if they escaped bleaching again in 2020 and 2022. \u201cIronically, the corals that are now prevalent on many reefs are young colonies of fast-growing heat-sensitive species of branching corals \u2013 analogous to the rapid recovery of flammable grasses after a forest fire.\u201d\nThe Australian government has been criticised for failing to do enough to protect the reef from climate change, which is being driven by the burning of fossil fuels. Australia is a leading exporter of coal and gas, some of which is shipped through the reef.\n\u201cWe know the biggest threat to coral reefs worldwide is climate change. The Great Barrier Reef is no exception,\u201d Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said. \u201cWe need to act on climate change.\u201d\nGreenpeace Australia Pacific chief executive David Ritter said: \u201cClaims that Australia is taking the health of the Great Barrier Reef seriously ring hollow when we continue to expand and subsidise the coal and gas industry to the tune of billions every year.\u201d\nAustralia has been lobbying for years to keep the reef \u2013 which contributes about A$6 billion (S$5.3 billion) to the economy and supports 64,000 jobs \u2013 off Unesco\u2019s endangered list as it could lead to losing its heritage status, taking some shine off its attraction for tourists."}
