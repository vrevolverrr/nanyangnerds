Its front side bears a crescent and five stars, with the words \u201cCovid-19\u201d and \u201cResilience Medal\u201d, while its reverse side holds the state crest encircled by the words \u201cSG United\u201d and \u201cStronger Together\u201d.\nThose who made exceptional contributions will receive existing state awards such as the Commendation Medal, the Public Service Medal and the Public Administration Medal. These will be modified, with the word \u201cCovid-19\u201d added.\nAll medals awarded for Covid-19 contributions will have a ribbon that has a thin red line at its centre, flanked on each side by a strip of white, light turquoise and dark turquoise.\nIn his rally speech, PM Lee had jokingly suggested having two red lines on the ribbon to represent the lines of a positive antigen rapid test result.\nHe also noted that many involved in the fight against Covid-19 had gone beyond their call of duty, including healthcare workers, public officers, non-governmental organisations and countless individuals from all walks of life.\nHe paid tribute to individuals who had gone the extra mile, such as retiree Alice Chua, who volunteered at vaccination centres and took fellow seniors to their appointments, and Dr Norhisham Main from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, who would regularly interact with the community to explain the Covid-19 situation and dispel fears and concerns about the virus.\nPM Lee said award recipients would be announced at the end of the year, with award ceremonies held in 2023."}
