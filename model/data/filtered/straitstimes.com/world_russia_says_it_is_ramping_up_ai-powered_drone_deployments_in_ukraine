Belousov said soldiers needed to be trained accordingly.\nPresident Vladimir Putin said last month that Russia was ramping up drone production by around 10 times to nearly 1.4 million units this year.\nUkraine has also made extensive use of drones during the war, including to attack military targets and energy installations on Russian territory. One such strike last month triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major weapons arsenal in Russia's Tver region, west of Moscow. REUTERS"}
