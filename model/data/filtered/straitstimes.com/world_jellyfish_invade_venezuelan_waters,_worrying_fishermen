This has never happened before,\u201d said Elvis Morillo, 59, a fisherman in the northern village of Chuao, where verdant mountains hug the Caribbean coast.\nThe invasive cannonball jellyfish is filling fishermen\u2019s nets, in a surge the environment ministry attributes to warming waters from climate change and a decline in jellyfish predators such as sharks and sea turtles.\nAt the same time, \u201csardines and other species that serve as fishing bait have disappeared. Fishing is at its lowest level in years,\u201d said Gustavo Carrasquel, of the NGO Azul Ambientalistas, who lives in Choroni, a town neighboring Chuao.\nGlobally, jellyfish populations have soared. Researchers have warned of a tipping point in which the oceans could go from being dominated by fish populations, to jellyfish \u2013 mostly as a result of overfishing.\nThe gelatinous creatures, which do not have a heart, brain or complex organs, thrive in harsh conditions and need little oxygen.\nThis is an \u201catypical event, completely abnormal,\u201d said Joxmer Scott-Frias, a researcher at the Institute of Zoology and Tropical Ecology at the Central University of Venezuela.\n\u201cA few individuals had been observed in recent years, but the increase in the population this year exceeded previous estimates,\u201d he said while collecting samples of the jellyfish for study.\nScott-Frias said the reasons for the surge were not yet clear.\nThe jellyfish bloom and the presence of the invasive coral Unomia stolonifera, which smothers native corals, have become a headache for local fishermen.\n\u201cIt has been almost nine months without fish production,\u201d said Fernando Mayora, head of the fishermen\u2019s council in Choroni.\n\u201cWith the problem of jellyfish and invasive corals, we don\u2019t know what to do. The fish have disappeared,\u201d he said.\nIn Chuao, fishermen who would bring in between 3,000 and 5,000 kilograms a week have seen their yields drop to between 500 and 1,000 kilograms, said Douglas Martinez, 44, a fisherman.\nMayora said that Venezuela should draw inspiration from countries such as Mexico, which exploits jellyfish commercially, exporting it to Asian countries where it is used in gastronomy or the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u201cWe need to know if we can take advantage of this in Venezuela,\u201d he said.
