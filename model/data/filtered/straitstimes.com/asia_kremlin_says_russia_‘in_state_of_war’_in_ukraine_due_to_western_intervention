Yes, it started out as a special military operation, but as soon as this group was formed, when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, it became a war for us,\u201d Mr Peskov said.\n\u201cI am convinced of that. And everyone should understand this, for their internal motivation.\u201d\nRussian officials, from President Vladimir Putin down, have gradually started to use the word \u201cwar\u201d from time to time, having long insisted previously that the term be avoided.\nMr Peskov said also that Russia must fully \u201cliberate\u201d its \u201cnew regions\u201d to ensure people\u2019s safety there, a reference to the four Ukrainian regions which Russia claimed to have annexed in 2022.\nKyiv says Russia\u2019s annexation was an illegal land grab and that it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from its soil. It is also determined to return the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia took from it in 2014.\nMoscow, which has invested heavily in Crimea, says the peninsula is part of Russia and that its status has been settled once and for all.
