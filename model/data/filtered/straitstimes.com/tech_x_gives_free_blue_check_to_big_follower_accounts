Kidding. Help me. But don\u2019t say anything too free speechy about me or my Garbage Tower of Babel,\u201d actor Jeffrey Wright, who received an unsolicited check, said in a post on X.\nSince Musk bought Twitter for US$44 billion in 2022, the platform\u2019s advertising business has collapsed as marketers soured on his leadership and the mass firings at the company that gutted content moderation.\nX on Tuesday named company veteran Kylie McRoberts as the new head of safety in an effort to shore up income from advertising, still the site\u2019s main source of revenue.\nAccording to most industry-accepted metrics, X has lost users since Musk took ownership, but the company says activity on the site has grown.
