One detainee said he was responsible for recruiting young people who were then sent to study in Moscow and paid 500 euros a month, police added.\nThe group of 20 flew to Istanbul, where they were met by a Russian citizen, police said. The next day, they received cash and phones at a training ground near Moscow where they learned how to spark and destabilise protests and protect provocateurs, police added.\nFrom there, they returned to Moldova via Antalya, Turkey, police said, adding that authorities had identified 13 members of the group and searched the homes of four of them on Friday, seizing paint, gloves, and bank and ID cards that proved they had traveled to Russia.
