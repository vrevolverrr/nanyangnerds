It will also need enough experience to anchor group representation constituencies, especially those that are expected to see a tough fight in the next general election, like Marine Parade and West Coast.\nThe election has to be held by November 2025.\nSingapore Management University law don Eugene Tan said the reshuffle could happen even before the end of 2023, with no more movements from then until after the election.\nThis would give ministers and other key political office holders about a year to roll out policy changes, especially those related to Forward Singapore, he said.\nForward Singapore, a nationwide engagement exercise led by DPM Wong, culminated in a road map for Singapore\u2019s future, the details of which were released in end-October.\nOn whether the leadership transition announcement has thrown up any clues on when the election may be held, the political pundits concurred that there was no ideal time for this.\nPolitical observer Felix Tan said there is a high chance it could be called in 2024, though the exact date would still depend on when the handover takes place.\nProfessor Eugene Tan said an election could be called as early as the first half of 2024 after the Budget, or in the last quarter of the year.\nAn election held after Budget 2025 cannot be ruled out either, though that would be the last viable window, he added.\nDr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore, said it is possible that DPM Wong could take over after PM Lee delivers his swansong National Day Rally in 2024. This would then leave the new leader to set the election date.\nHaving an election so soon after the leadership transition, though, may not be the most prudent, so there needs to be some runway to prepare for the election, he added.\nMr Zulkifli said it would not be in the PAP\u2019s interest to delay the election, given that economic conditions are unlikely to improve in the next one to two years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as good timing for elections any more. Contestation and appetite for opposition are stronger than in the past,\u201d he said.\nProf Eugene Tan said that apart from Mr Ong and Mr Chan, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee\u2019s name is also in the mix.\nWhile Sunday\u2019s announcement reiterates PM Lee\u2019s confidence in the 4G team, the observers said DPM Wong still has his work cut out for him in getting Singaporeans\u2019 buy-in.\n\u201cIt is very likely that PM Lee wanted to be certain that DPM Wong\u2019s vision for Singapore and the PAP is well established and clearly articulated \u2013 through the Forward SG report \u2013 before handing over the reins,\u201d said Dr Felix Tan.\nDr Gillian Koh, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, said it is important for DPM Wong to stay connected to the ground during the transition process.\nThis is important as he seeks the trust of Singaporeans to implement the Forward Singapore agenda and help everyone ride through the difficult conditions that the world and therefore Singapore will see in the days ahead, she said."}
