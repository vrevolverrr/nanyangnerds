He said Washington hoped the operation would \u201ceradicate it from the virtual battlefield.\u201d\nThe official said the FSB spies behind the malware, known as Snake, are part of a notorious hacking group tracked by the private sector and known as \u201cTurla.\u201d\nThe group has been active for two decades against a variety of Nato-aligned targets, US government agencies and technology companies, a senior FBI official said.\nRussian diplomats did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Moscow routinely denies carrying out cyberespionage operations.\nUS officials spoke to journalists on Tuesday ahead of the news release on condition that they not be named. Similar announcements, revealing the FSB cyber disruption effort, were made by security agencies in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\nTurla is widely considered one of the most sophisticated hacking teams studied by the security research community.\n\u201cThey have persisted in the shadows by focusing on stealth and operational security,\u201d said John Hultquist, vice president of threat analysis at US cybersecurity company Mandiant. \u201cThey are one of the hardest targets we have.\u201d REUTERS"}
