Some 18 cases are still active, with new cases being added all the time, SECO said.\nThe majority of cases relate to breaches of bans on exporting luxury goods or products of economic importance to Russia which could support Moscow's war effort, a SECO spokesman said.\nWhile SECO carries out the more simple investigations, the more complicated cases are handed over to the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), which last week said it was looking into possible breaches.\nSwiss broadcaster RTS said last week the OAG has also been called into two cases involving commodities trading companies. The OAG declined to comment on the cases.\n\"The complexity of these cases is very high,\" said Simon Pluess, the head of export controls and sanctions at SECO. \"For example there are often companies hiding behind other companies and we have to establish who the beneficial owner is.\"\nOther countries were now recognising that Switzerland was taking sanctions seriously, he said.\n\"When we talk with international partners they have recognised that Switzerland is doing a lot,\" Pluess said. \"Switzerland is also sharing information with other countries. The criticism has mostly disappeared.\" REUTERS"}
