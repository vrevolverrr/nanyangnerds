It has a new emphasis on \u201ccollaborative ecosystems\u201d.\nSuch systems involve the public, the private sector and the Government, recognising that citizens have a part to play in policymaking, and in the governance of cities.\nOne prime example of such collaboration, said the publication, is the Forward Singapore exercise, a nationwide engagement with Singaporeans to refresh the country\u2019s social compact and develop the national agenda for a new generation.\nA series of memorandums of understanding (MOUs) will be signed during the summit.\nThe Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Singapore Management University (SMU) signed an MOU on June 3.\nSLA said that its geospatial information \u2013 referring to data associated with a particular location such as aerial images and street maps \u2013 will be used in the Cooling Singapore 2.0 research project, which SMU co-leads.\nAmong the project\u2019s products is a Digital Urban Climate Twin of Singapore that will explore the heat effects of buildings, transport and industry.\nSLA said its data, and the digital twin, will aid policymakers in Singapore in assessing effective climate adaptation solutions that can enhance the city\u2019s climate resilience.\nDuring a panel discussion on leveraging geospatial data to improve citizens\u2019 quality of life, Mr Vincent Karremans, vice-mayor of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, said such data has helped his city to prioritise investments in climate adaptation.\n\u201cDue to this geospatial technology, we know exactly which neighbourhoods, which streets \u2013 even portions of streets \u2013 are the most vulnerable to heatwaves or heavy rainfall because we can put that all into a model,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is an instrument to determine where to invest in a city, where to put more green infrastructure, and where to expand our sewer system.\u201d"}
