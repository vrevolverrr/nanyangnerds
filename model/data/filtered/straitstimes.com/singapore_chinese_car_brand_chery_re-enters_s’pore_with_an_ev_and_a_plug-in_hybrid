The spokesman for VGS said it will start welcoming both Seat and Cupra cars from next Thursday.\nVGS said that its plans for the Seat brand is only for aftersales, repair and warranty services. This means that the Spanish brand will not have any retail representation after Vertex has sold the remaining stock of cars.\nVertex said it will focus on EV and PHEV models and will stop selling internal combustion engine models from 2024.\nSeat does not have any EV or PHEV models for sale in Singapore.\nWhile Chery was among the most successful Chinese car brands when it arrived here in 2006, rising certificate of entitlement prices in the years that followed have made them less attractive to budget-conscious buyers. This time, Chery is looking to shed that budget image to appeal to buyers looking for technology.\nChery\u2019s relaunch in Singapore will start with two models under sub-brands Omoda and Jaecoo.\nIn recent years, Chinese car companies have been creating sub-brands with distinctly different models.\nThe Omoda 5 EV crossover vehicle is expected to arrive by the fourth quarter of 2023 and the Jaecoo 7, which is a PHEV, will follow in the first quarter of 2024.\nBoth models made their world debut at the Auto Shanghai show in April. Details, including price and specifications of these models, have yet to be confirmed.\nVertex is also preparing to bring in a new brand of electric commercial vehicles from China by the end of 2023. The line-up will include a light goods vehicle and a pickup truck, which will be available as a single-cab and a double-cab style truck. When asked, Vertex\u2019s spokesman did not name the brand.\nThe showroom at Ubi Road 4 will start renovations in June in preparation for the change. The new layout will accommodate Chery, the new commercial vehicle brand, and the remaining stock of Seat cars until they are sold."}
