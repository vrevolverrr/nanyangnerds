Analysts said, though, that sales may improve with increased tourism and the year-end festive season.\nSeptember takings at the till rose 0.6 per cent year on year, down from a revised 4.2 per cent increase in August.\nExcluding motor vehicles, retail sales edged up 0.5 per cent versus the 4 per cent growth recorded in August, according to figures released by the Singapore Department of Statistics on Friday.\nOn a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, retail sales turned negative, dropping 1.6 per cent in September. Excluding auto sales, they declined 0.8 per cent.\nThe biggest year-on-year increases came from food and alcohol (22.6 per cent) and cosmetics, toiletries and medical goods (10.3 per cent). This was mainly driven by higher demand for alcoholic products \u2013 including those sold in duty-free shops \u2013 and cosmetics, respectively.\nSimilarly, sales of apparel and footwear rose 8.1 per cent.\nIn contrast, retailers of more expensive items, namely computer and telecommunications equipment and furniture and household equipment, saw sales drop 12.7 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively, in September.\nOCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said these softer retail sales patches suggest there could be some pullback in private consumption appetite for big-ticket items, as wage growth expectations cool.\nOn a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, motor vehicle sales fell 7.7 per cent in September from August.\nSimilarly, retailers of watches and jewellery, and furniture and household equipment, saw declines in sales of 4.6 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively.\nConversely, month-on-month sales of petrol service stations rose 4.7 per cent, while those of cosmetics, toiletries and medical goods climbed 4.5 per cent.\nThe food and beverage sector held up better than shop retailers in September. The sector\u2019s total sales rose 6.9 per cent year on year, easing from the 8.6 per cent increase in August.\nFood caterers saw their takings swell by 24.1 per cent, while sales at restaurants and fast-food outlets rose by 3.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively.
