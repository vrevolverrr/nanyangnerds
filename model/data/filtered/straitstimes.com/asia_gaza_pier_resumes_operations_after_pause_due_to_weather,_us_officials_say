The UN said it would review security before resuming aid deliveries from the dock.\nThe UN has not yet resumed transportation of the aid from the pier to UN World Food Programme warehouses. WFP chief Cindy McCain said on June 10 that those warehouses were struck on June 9 and one person injured.\nAid began arriving via the US-built pier on May 17, and the UN said it transported 137 trucks of aid to warehouses, some 900 metric tons, before the US announced on May 28 that it had suspended operations so repairs could be made.\nUS President Joe Biden announced in March the plan to put the pier in place for aid deliveries as famine loomed in Gaza, a Hamas-run enclave of 2.3 million people, during the war between Israel and the Palestinian militants.
