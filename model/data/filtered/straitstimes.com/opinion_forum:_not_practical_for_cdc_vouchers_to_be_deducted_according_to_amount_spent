{"title": "Forum: Not practical for CDC vouchers to be deducted according to amount spent", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2024-07-05", "content": "I do not see any problem with the way the CDC vouchers are structured in denominations of $2 and $5 for use at food centres and shops (Fixed denominations restrict use of CDC vouchers, especially for budget meals, July 4).\nAren\u2019t physical notes structured in the same manner? All that the writer needs to do is to top up the balance with his money. If he is using a $2 voucher and the meal costs $2.80, he can top up 80 cents, or $1.50 if it is $3.50. The cash top-up is a small amount as he has already saved $2 by using the voucher.\nI would say the denominations of the CDC vouchers are well thought of in terms of the cost of meals, which typically start from $5, and also for usage by the majority.\nWe should not be asking for the vouchers to be structured to suit everyone as there would be no end to such demands.\nIt is also not practical for CDC vouchers to be distributed in two lump sums of $150 each and be deducted according to the amount spent as suggested by the writer, as there are people who use the printed vouchers and those with no mobile phones.\nLet\u2019s be grateful to the excellent team that put effort into designing the vouchers. CDC vouchers have certainly gone a long way in cushioning our wallets."}
