My hand was injured and a finger was gone.\"\nCarried by his comrades into a field hospital in the heart of the sprawling steelworks, his leg was amputated just below the knee.\nHe was then evacuated by helicopter to a hospital in Dnipro in central Ukraine.\nTwo months later, he is getting around with crutches and hopes to soon have a prosthetic leg fitted, funded by the Ukrainian government.\n\"If possible, I want to continue serving in the army and keep fighting,\" he explains.\n\"A leg is nothing because we're in the 21st century and you can make good prostheses and continue to live and serve,\" he says.\n\"I know many guys in the war now have prostheses and are on the front lines.\"\nResources needed\nOn Wednesday afternoon, he had his first consultation with the medics who will fit him with a new limb.\nInside the clinic at a rundown building in Kyiv, a dozen specialists are making prosthetic limbs inside a workshop covered in plaster, while in the consultation rooms, doctors are considering which might be the right model for each of their patients.\nBut Suleimanishvili's case is not so straightforward.\nAmplitude Magazine, a specialist American publication aimed at amputees, said Ukraine would need significant resources.\n\"To assist the hundreds or thousands of Ukrainian amputees who reportedly need treatment, aid volunteers will need to work from centralised locations that are well stocked,\" it said.\nHowever, \"there are a limited number of such clinics within Ukraine, and the supply chains that serve them are spotty at best.\"\n'Up and running in weeks'\nStetsenko said Ukraine has around 30 facilities that made prostheses, with his own clinic normally producing around 300 every year.\nThe clinic won't be able to step up production because each prosthesis is \"customised\" to suit the injury and needs of each patient.\nIn the case of Suleimanishvili, who is a gunner, the doctors will add 15 kilogrammes to the weight of his new leg so it can support his use of heavy weaponry.\n\"I want the prosthetic so I can do most manoeuvres,\" he insists.\nIn a week's time, he will be back to have a temporary prosthesis fitted so he can start learning to walk.\n\"In two or three weeks, he will be running,\" another doctor, Valeri Nebesny, told AFP, saying that like Suleimanishvili, \"90 per cent\" of military amputees want to get back to the battlefield as quickly as possible."}
