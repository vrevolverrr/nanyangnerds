This restriction will be removed from Saturday (June 5).\nA large majority of the 32,000 people here who have not been able to take the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines because of medical reasons will now be able to do so under the national programme, MOH said.\nBut a minority with a history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions to other vaccines will still not be eligible.\nAnother 2,000 people who developed allergic reactions after receiving the first dose of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine should not receive an mRNA-based vaccine again, the ministry added.\nMOH said it is evaluating and will bring in non-mRNA vaccines which are more suited to these individuals.\nIt expects to do so before the end of the year after the vaccines are approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).\nIn a separate statement, the expert committee on Covid-19 vaccination said it had adopted a cautious stance in recommending earlier that people should not take mRNA vaccines if they have a history of anaphylaxis - a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. This was in the light of overseas and local reports of anaphylaxis with the mRNA vaccines in people with a history of allergies, when those vaccines were first introduced.\nIt noted that local and international data has been reassuring and no safety issues have been found after inoculating people with a history of anaphylaxis to other triggers, such as medicine and food.\nIt stressed that those with a history of serious allergic reactions to any component of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine are still not advised to receive it, and those who have an anaphylatic reaction after the first dose should not receive the second dose.\n\"Non-mRNA vaccines may be authorised for use by HSA and be made available in the future, hence these individuals are advised to wait for these vaccines instead,\" said the committee.\nIt added that it will continue reviewing safety data to see if more people who are currently not eligible to receive mRNA vaccines can be inoculated with them.\nAt the same time, Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders who were unable to get the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines due to allergies and want to take the Sinovac vaccine will be able to get it for free at private clinics under the Special Access Route (SAR), MOH said.\nAbout 20 private medical centres here will be selected to be licensed providers to administer the Chinese vaccine, about 200,000 doses of which arrived in February. The vaccines \u200bfrom the current stock \u200bwill be released for free\u200b.\nProviders will be allowed to charge patients a fee to cover their costs, and the Government will reimburse this fee to any of the 34,000 individuals who opt for Sinovac after they were previously rejected from taking mRNA vaccines or were allergic.\nMOH noted that while the Government will facilitate arrangements to take the Sinovac vaccine through licensed providers, this is ultimately a private arrangement. The ministry said it will draw up guidelines on proper counselling, informed consent and safe management of patients.\n\"However, as the vaccine remains unregistered, it cannot be covered by the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme. Individuals who wish to receive vaccination under SAR should discuss with their doctor in these appointed providers the risks and benefits of using these vaccines, and jointly make an informed decision,\" MOH said.\nPrivate healthcare institutions can apply from Friday to be licensed providers of the existing stock of Sinovac vaccine doses. Applications will close by noon on June 11.\nAsked why HSA has not authorised the Sinovac jab for wider use despite WHO's emergency-use approval, Prof Teo said it is important to realise the WHO has to take a global perspective when approving Covid-19 vaccines.\nHe said: \"The WHO is always evaluating global needs, including that of low- and middle-income countries. They want to ensure that resource-poor countries will continue to have access to vaccines that are effective.\"\nOn the other hand, regulatory processes in Singapore and other countries depend on each country's specific needs, outbreak situation, and long-term ambition with respect to the pandemic, Prof Teo said.\n\"In Singapore, we want to ensure not just safety but maximum effectiveness when our people are vaccinated. That means we want to be very clear about the efficacy data for the vaccines that we roll out nationally,\" he said.\nThis is not the case with the Sinovac jab, Prof Teo added.\nWhile the vaccine meets WHO's criteria of being safe and having an efficacy of at least 50 per cent, data published so far has shown that the jab has a divergent range of efficacy rates, from just over 50 per cent to about 90 per cent, Prof Teo said.\nIn contrast, both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have consistently shown an effectiveness greater than 90 per cent, he noted.\n\"I should highlight that 50 per cent efficacy for a vaccine is actually very good so it is not to say that it is a lower bar... (but) I think consistency helps with the entire evaluation process and there is a need to clarify more carefully what is the efficacy of Sinovac's vaccine,\" Prof Teo added."}
