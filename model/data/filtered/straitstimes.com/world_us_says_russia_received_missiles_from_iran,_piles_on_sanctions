In August, Kyiv sent troops into Russia on their first large-scale cross-border incursion.\nThe Iranian missiles can be used on closer targets, allowing Russia to use more of its own arsenal for targets that are further from the front line, Mr Blinken said.\nRussia, which previously signed up to United Nations restrictions on Iran, was also sharing technology sought by Tehran, he added.\n\u201cThis is a two-way street, including on nuclear issues as well as some space information,\u201d Mr Blinken said.\nCaspian voyages\nThe Treasury and the State Department imposed sanctions on 10 individuals and nine entities based in Iran and Russia, the Treasury said.\nThe sanctions freeze any US assets held by those targeted, denying them access, and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.\nIncluded in the Sept 10 sanctions were ships that regularly bring cargo across the Caspian Sea between Iran and Russia, including the Port Olya-3, a vessel owned by Russia-based company MG-FLOT that was used to transport close-range ballistic missiles, the Treasury said.\nThe vessel made a series of voyages between the Russian Caspian port of Olya and Iran\u2019s Amirabad port between May and August 2024, according to ship tracking data.\nThe State Department also said Iran Air was further targeted because it was used to procure sensitive Western-origin goods and transport materials for Iran\u2019s drone programme.\nFrance, Germany and Britain said they were cancelling air services agreements with Iran and pledged to impose sanctions on Iran Air and those involved in Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme and providing arms to Russia.\nBritain announced seven new sanctions designations under its Iran sanctions regime and three under its Russia regime.\nThe European Union also vowed a \u201cstrong response.\u201d\nMr David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security research group, said he doubted the new sanctions would have any impact on halting Iran\u2019s cooperation with Russia because Tehran sees stronger ties with Moscow - and Beijing - in its best economic and political interests.\n\u201cThey will have some impact on shipping companies and vessels, but others can move in,\u201d said Mr Albright, a former UN nuclear inspector.\nBlinken visit\nUkraine, which said it could cut diplomatic ties with Tehran if Russia uses Iranian-supplied missiles, welcomed the sanctions but said they were not sufficient.\nPresidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak reiterated that Kyiv was seeking Washington\u2019s permission to use US-supplied weapons deeper inside Russia.\nThe Pentagon has said that Ukraine can use US weapons to return fire coming from Russia, a policy that in theory could allow Ukrainian forces to strike Iranian missiles being prepared for launch.\nMr Blinken said he would use his visit to Ukraine on Sept 11 to hear directly from Ukraine\u2019s leadership what their current needs and objectives are and what the US can do to help.\nMr Blinken and Mr Lammy will visit together in a bid to show united Western support for Kyiv.\nMr Blinken will also visit Poland on Sept 12, the State Department said.
