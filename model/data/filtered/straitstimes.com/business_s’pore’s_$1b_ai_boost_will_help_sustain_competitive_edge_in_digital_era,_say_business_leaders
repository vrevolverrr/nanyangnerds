In December 2023, it launched an updated National AI Strategy 2.0, outlining ways to leverage AI to empower workers and businesses.\nIn his Budget speech, DPM Wong said AI is not just about ChatGPT or large language models.\nInstead, it is a general purpose technology that has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, and to enhance productivity.\nMs Priya Mahajan, head of public policy and regulatory at Verizon, said Singapore\u2019s digital ecosystem holds the potential to fuel an ongoing cycle of economic growth.\nThis must be accompanied by robust privacy measures and free data flows, as well as a light-touch regulatory approach.\n\u201cWith respect to emerging technologies, implementing global best practices, such as the establishment of a single unified regulatory body, will ensure consistent standards for both consumers and businesses across different industries.\n\u201cThis will in turn foster a climate of technology-related investment, innovation and competition in Singapore,\u201d she said.\nMs Tay Bee Kheng, president of Cisco Asean, hopes to see more resources channelled into AI governance.\n\u201cWith only 36 per cent of respondents in Singapore saying their organisations have highly comprehensive AI policies and protocols in place, according to Cisco\u2019s AI Readiness Index, more support will be required to educate organisations on the importance of adapting internal policies to address data privacy and security and the ethical use of AI,\u201d she said.\nMs Tay welcomed Singapore\u2019s efforts to strengthen its cyber-security resilience, with the setting up of a new National Cybersecurity Command Centre that will better coordinate its cyber-defence operations.\nAccording to a study from Capital Economics, which ranks countries according to their potential to benefit from AI, Singapore came in second after the United States in 2023, followed by Britain and Switzerland.\nDespite its strong innovation capacity and huge investments in AI, China came in around the middle of the group of 33 countries due to its strict regulatory approach that slowed the spread of AI technology, the report said.\nMr Sujith Abraham, senior vice-president and general manager of Asean at Salesforce, a US cloud-based software company, was hopeful that the planned investment will \u201cdemocratise access to digital technologies, spur AI innovation and accelerate business transformation\u201d.\n\u201cAI is no longer a nice-to-have but an imperative for all businesses to implement and enable their workforce to work with if they don\u2019t want to get left behind,\u201d he said.\nMs Jess O\u2019Reilly, area vice-president for Asia at US software company UiPath, said initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster private-public partnerships and combine education and innovation can help workers embrace digital transformation.\nShe added that the extension of the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the new SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme demonstrate the Singapore Government\u2019s continuing support for digital upskilling and access to learning opportunities.\nCorrection note: In an earlier version of the story, we said Google\u2019s AI Trailblazers supported 100 organisations in developing impactful generative AI solutions in Singapore. The newsmaker has since clarified it is only 84."}
