It was not because I wanted to, but my situation forced me to\u201d.\nHe underwent a medical check-up before two months of basic training.\n\u201cI was employed with the government, but I\u2019ve heard there are Nepalis fighting in private forces, too,\u201d he said.\nThe recruits \u2013 15 of them Nepalis \u2013 woke at 6am to start the drills.\n\u201cWe learnt firing positions, how to make bunkers, and how to target drones,\u201d he said.\nBut \u201cthe language is also a problem\u201d, he added. \u201cWe cannot understand the instructions they give, and in the battleground, that can be dangerous.\u201d\nSent to the front lines in Ukraine, Mr Sharma\u2019s unit \u2013 mostly Russian, with six Nepalis \u2013 was ambushed even before they reached Kupiansk in the east.\nExplosions killed several of Mr Sharma\u2019s comrades, and he was wounded in the legs and hand.\n\u201cSometimes it felt like a movie,\u201d he said.\nHe spent months in hospital before deserting as he neared recovery to seek help from Nepal\u2019s embassy in Moscow.\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t return\u201d to the front, he said. \u201cSo, I took a risk to return to Nepal, thinking I will either go to jail or home.\u201d"}
