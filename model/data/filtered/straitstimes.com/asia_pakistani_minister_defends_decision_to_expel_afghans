A Taliban spokesman rejected that assertion.\n\"Whenever there was any problem, people would immigrate to Pakistan, take refuge in Pakistan,\" Jilani said.\n\"But now I think it has been more than 40 years, so the government of Pakistan has taken a decision,\" Jilani said, noting that the situation in Afghanistan had stabilised.\nDecades of war in Afghanistan largely ended in mid-2021 when the Taliban re-took control as U.S.-led foreign forces were withdrawing and a U.S.-backed government collapsed.\nWhile Pakistan has for years favoured the Taliban as Pakistan's best option in its neighbour, relations have deteriorated over the past couple of years, largely over Pakistani accusations that Islamists fighting the Pakistani state operate from Afghan territory.\nThe Taliban deny that.\nJilani said Pakistan had been discussing the migrant issue with Afghanistan \"for a very long time\" and he called on international humanitarian agencies to help with the process.\nAid officials say Afghanistan is already facing a humanitarian crisis and the forced repatriation of large numbers of people would compound dire problems.
