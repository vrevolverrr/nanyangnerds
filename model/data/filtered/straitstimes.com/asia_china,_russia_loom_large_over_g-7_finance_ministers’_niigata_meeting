The European Union is a \u201cnon-enumerated\u201d member without right to the rotating presidency.\nOn Friday afternoon, G-7 finance chiefs and central bank governors hosted a rare outreach session with six invited nations \u2013 Brazil, Comoros, India, Indonesia, Singapore and South Korea. Singapore was represented by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong.\nThe outreach session discussed topics such as cooperation for sustainable goals, quality infrastructure, supply chains, and debt issues affecting developing countries.\nOther issues on the agenda on Friday included ways to safeguard financial stability from bank runs.\nThree regional US lenders \u2013 Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank \u2013 have collapsed since March.\nThe G-7 finance chiefs on Thursday night discussed the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, seeking to bolster the bloc\u2019s sanctions regime against Moscow to push the Kremlin to end the war.\nUkraine\u2019s Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko participated online in Thursday night\u2019s session.\nMoscow\u2019s circumvention of sanctions, including through third-party loopholes, has been a headache for the G-7.\nThe Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday that countries such as China, India and Turkey have filled the gap by expanding trade with Russia, whose economy shrunk just 2.1 per cent in 2022.\nWhile trade volumes between the G-7 and Russia shrunk by US$52.1 billion (S$69.5 billion) in 2022, this was dwarfed by the US$103.2 billion increase in trade between Russia and China, India and Turkey, the report said.\nSaid Japan Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki before Thursday\u2019s session: \u201cI expect to discuss the necessary response to maintain pressure on Russia\u2019s ability to wage war.\u201d\nDr Yellen added that the G-7 \u201cwill stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to end the conflict\u201d.\nFinance chiefs were also concerned by the risk that the US Treasury would run out of cash to pay the government\u2019s debts.\nThis could come as soon as June 1 amid an impasse between US President Joe Biden\u2019s Democrats and Republicans, Dr Yellen told Bloomberg TV.\nThe Democrats want to raise the debt ceiling without conditions, while the Republicans say any increase must be tied to sweeping budget cuts.\nA meeting between Mr Biden and top bipartisan congressional leaders has been postponed to next week.\nThe debt ceiling has been raised nearly 80 times since 1960, and a failure to raise the US$31.4 trillion limit will wreak economic and financial catastrophe on the global economy.\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner told reporters on Friday that he hoped US politicians will take the \u201cgrown-up\u201d decision."}
