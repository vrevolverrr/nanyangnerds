He was given a royal pardon and released from prison days after PH triumphed in the May elections.\nMr Anwar was not present at the press conference.\nDatuk Saifuddin Nasution, secretary general of PKR explained that the party selected that seat for Mr Anwar's anticipated political return due to several factors, one being that the ward is seen as a \"safe seat\".\n\"Port Dickson has been a constituency that's been represented by PKR in the last three terms. For that we consider it as one of the safer seats,\" said Mr Saifuddin.\nHe added that as of now, there are no plans for Mr Anwar to take a post in the administration on his return to Parliament, as Mr Anwar has said he prefers to focus on parliamentary reform.\nMr Danyal has submitted his resignation letter to Parliament's Speaker, after which the Election Commission will set a by-election date.\nThe semi-urban seat of Port Dickson has a population comprising 53 per cent Malays, 26 per cent Chinese and 21 per cent Indians, according to the Department of Statistics.\nDatuk Danyal is relatively new to politics. He was roped in to contest the May elections at the eleventh hour, after PKR's initial candidate was penalised by the Election Commission for failing to submit a document."}
