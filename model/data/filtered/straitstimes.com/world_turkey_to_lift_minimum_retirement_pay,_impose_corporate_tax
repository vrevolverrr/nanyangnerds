The central bank has kept its policy rate at 50% in recent months after an aggressive tightening campaign.\nThe draft law also includes new savings plans aiming to strengthen fair taxation, including a minimum corporate tax.\nA minimum 15% corporate tax will be imposed on multi-national companies that have more than 750 million euro ($817.58 million) annual consolidated revenue, according to the draft bill, confirming earlier comments by the finance minister.\nThe bill also imposes a 10% minimum corporate tax for local companies.\nA new income tax model will be introduced for commercial and self-employment earnings in which their declarations and incomes will be compared, according to the draft.\nIf the earnings of the taxpayers exceed 20% of their declarations, they'll be questioned by tax authorities. \"This regulation aims to ensure tax security and reduce informality,\" the draft bill said.\nThe draft increases tax penalties for informality.\nThe plan also raises corporate tax for companies that run public-private partnership projects, including new bridges and highways, to 30% from 25%.
