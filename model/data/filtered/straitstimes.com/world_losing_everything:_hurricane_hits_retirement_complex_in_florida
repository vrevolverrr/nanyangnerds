Police and firefighters went from building to building in boats on Oct 10, helping people get to dry land.\n\u201cWe lost everything,\u201d said Mr Rodriguez, a 54-year-old Cuban man who has been living in Florida for 20 years. \u201cBut at least we are alive. That is all we have left.\u201d\nOutside their homes, dozens of residents look confused and shell shocked \u2013 like they did not know what to do next. They carried bags with the few belongings they were able to salvage, and in some cases their pet dogs and cats.\nNo one expected so much flooding in a neighbourhood that was not part of the many mandatory evacuation zones that Florida officials declared in the second major hurricane in as many weeks.\nThe neighbourhood was not damaged at all when Hurricane Helene hit late last month.\nMilton killed at least 11 people as it churned across the state and then out to the Atlantic. But Floridians heaved a sigh of relief because the storm surge, catastrophic damage and loss of life that many people feared did not materialise in the end.\nNow, what?\nWhen Ms Escalona saw a few inches of water on the floor of her home, she first thought a neighbour had left the water running, but soon realised something was very wrong.\n\u201cIt all happened very quickly. The water rushed in suddenly, it was strong, with a lot of current,\u201d Ms Escalona recalled.\n\u201cWe grabbed some papers and the dog and left. We spent the night outside the door of the neighbours upstairs.\u201d\nNow she and her husband are wondering what to do and where to go.\n\u201cIt is not easy to think you have everything and suddenly you have nothing,\u201d said Mr Rodriguez.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where to go. We have been in this country for nearly 20 years and have no family. It\u2019s her, me, and the dog,\u201d he said, pointing to their chihuahua Tito.\nRelief replaces fear\nEven though Milton was a powerful Category 3 hurricane on a five-level scale, in the end Florida was not hit nearly as hard as officials had feared.\nIn fact, most of the 11 fatalities from the storm happened on the East Coast, away from where the storm made landfall, due to tornadoes that spun off from the storm.\nIn Sarasota, about 100 km south of Clearwater and near where the hurricane made landfall, streets were gradually getting back to normal.\nEmergency crews cleared many streets before dawn, but there were still downed trees in some places, along with broken glass and other damage.\nNear the marina in Sarasota, dozens of people walked around taking pictures of the storm damage with their cellphones. They looked at a speedboat that had rammed into a boat rental office because of Milton\u2019s powerful winds.\nMany people expressed relief that the city was not as badly damaged as they had expected.\n\u201cI think it could have been a lot worse,\u201d said one retiree, Ms Donna Pickup.\nThat feeling of relief is shared in Punta Gorda, 100 km south-east of Sarasota.\nIn that town, hit hard by Hurricane Ian in 2022, the storm surge that rushed in on the night of Oct 9 flooded seaside areas and left several yachts stranded on the ocean front promenade. But here, too, the damage was not as bad as many had feared.\n\u201cThank God,\u201d said Mr David Cardoso, \u201ca lot of houses are in pretty good tack.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt was supposed to hit us worse.\u201d AFP"}
