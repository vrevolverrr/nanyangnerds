The creaking Paris metro system performed efficiently, defying predictions of travel problems, while the city\u2019s bus drivers, garbage collectors and municipal workers kept the city moving, clean and well-organised.\n\u201cThe state is powerful in France and things worked well,\u201d Prof Dietschy added. \u201cThe success of the event has contradicted France\u2019s pessimism and cynicism and the idea that everything is going badly and is badly organised.\u201d\n\u2018Powerful emotions\u2019\nAlthough Mayor Hidalgo hopes the city and France more broadly can bask in the afterglow of a national triumph, most observers see signs that the country is already moving on from its sports-inspired break from reality.\nMs Hidalgo\u2019s controversial suggestion to retain the Olympic logo on the Eiffel Tower until the next edition in Los Angeles in 2028 has already divided Parisians and local lawmakers.\n\u201cIt will remain an interlude, moments of powerful emotions that were experienced at the time,\u201d Mr Jean-Daniel Levy, a public opinion expert from polling company Harris Interactive, told AFP of the Olympic and Paralympic periods.\nAs with all previous Olympiads, organisers are hoping for legacy achievements, which have often proved hard to measure or fleeting in the past.\nIt remains to be seen whether a short-term spike in interest in sport results in a durable increase in physical activity.\nThe majority of the public investment linked to the Games has been targeted at regenerating the Seine-Saint-Denis suburb north-east of Paris, which is the mainland\u2019s poorest and most crime-ridden area.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d Prof Dietschy said.\nA public audit into the cost of the Games, as well as several criminal investigations into organising committee members, including one targeting the salary of Mr Estanguet, could also tarnish the image of the event as a national success story.
