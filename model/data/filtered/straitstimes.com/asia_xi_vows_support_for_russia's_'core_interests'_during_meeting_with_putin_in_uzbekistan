China understands, and we are coordinating on various aspects,\" he said while on a visit to Russia last week.\nChina's top diplomat Yang Jiechi, too, told Russian ambassador Andrey Denisov in Beijing on Monday that China would work with Russia to \"safeguard common interests and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction\".\nWhile Beijing has said it has not provided military aid to Moscow, Chinese goods have helped sustain Russians' way of life amid sweeping sanctions by multiple countries. China has also ramped up its import of Russian oil in the past months."}
