It added that responsibility for the collision lies entirely on the Philippine side.\nChina asserts sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea, including areas claimed by the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brunei. Beijing has deployed an armada of vessels to protect its claims.\nAn international arbitral tribunal in 2016 ruled that Beijing\u2019s claim had no basis under international law, a landmark victory for the Philippines, which filed the case. Beijing rejects that decision.\nThe Philippines and China agreed to restore trust and rebuild confidence to manage maritime disputes at a high-level meeting in July.\nThat was followed by a provisional arrangement on Manila\u2019s resupply missions to a beached Filipino naval ship in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippine task force said of the Aug 25 confrontation: \u201cThese unprofessional, aggressive and illegal actions posed serious risks to the safety of the Filipino crew and the fishermen they were meant to serve.\u201d\nIt said the Bureau of Fisheries vessel, operating from Half-Moon Shoal to Sabina Shoal, encountered multiple Chinese vessels that deployed \u201cperilous manoeuvres\u201d, causing its engine to fail and forcing it to end the resupply mission.\nManila repeated its call for Beijing to halt \u201cprovocative actions that destabilise regional peace and security\u201d.\nOn Aug 24, Manila accused Beijing of \u201cunjustifiably\u201d deploying flares from the China-occupied Subi Reef on Aug 22 while a Philippine aircraft was conducting patrols.\nThe same aircraft had faced harassment from a Chinese jet fighter while it was conducting a surveillance flight near the Scarborough Shoal on Aug 19, the Philippines said.\nThe US \u2013 the Philippines\u2019 treaty ally \u2013 condemned China for launching the flares.
