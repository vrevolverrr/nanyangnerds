Mr Kaesang Pangarep, the President\u2019s son, will turn 30 in December, while registration for November\u2019s regional elections will open in late August.\nThe decision appears to be a setback for the dynastic legacy of Jokowi, as the President is known, as he prepares to hand over power in October due to term limits. Accusations of nepotism flared in 2023 after the Constitutional Court, in a decision chaired by Mr Widodo\u2019s brother-in-law, lowered minimum age limits for presidential and vice-presidential candidates.\nThat ruling paved the way for Mr Widodo\u2019s 36-year-old older son to make a successful run that will see him become vice-president in October.\nThe 29-year-old Kaesang had appeared on course for a regional role after the Supreme Court in May eased the minimum age limit for candidates in gubernatorial elections, saying a governor needs to be only at least 30 years old at the time of inauguration. Mr Widodo himself had used his role as Jakarta\u2019s governor as a successful launchpad to the presidency.\n\u201cThe Constitutional Court\u2019s decision interpreted a law, while the Supreme Court interpreted an implementing regulation,\u201d said legal expert and political commentator Bivitri Susanti from the Indonesia Jentera School of Law, who has conducted research on legislative, civil society and corruption issues for more than a decade. \u201cIt is clear, it should follow the new rules. There is no choice but to implement the (constitutional) court\u2019s decision.\u201d\nBut the wild card is the election commission, she added.\nIf the election commission does not follow the ruling, any candidate who does not meet the requirements will be declared invalid, constitutional judge Saldi Isra said in the court ruling. Candidates must fulfil all requirements before being named as official candidates, he added.\nThe question now becomes whether there is any avenue for Mr Kaesang or his allies to help him run for office in any case, or to otherwise circumvent the court\u2019s decision. He was backed by two political parties, including that of President-elect Prabowo Subianto, to run in the Central Java gubernatorial and vice-gubernatorial race.\n\u201cWith this decision, the age requirement for candidates must be met,\u201d said Ms Titi Anggraini, an advisory board member of the Association for Elections and Democracy or Perludem, an independent, non-profit advocacy group. \u201cIt is too risky to circumvent the court\u2019s decision as the nomination is inconsistent and invalid. If that happens, it will be very bad for legal certainty.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
