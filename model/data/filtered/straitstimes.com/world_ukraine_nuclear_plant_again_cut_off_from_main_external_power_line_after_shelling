If the external power lines are cut, the Zaporizhzhia plant must turn to backup diesel generators, and if those malfunction or run out of fuel, a meltdown becomes possible.\nAfter visiting the plant, Rafael Mariano Grossi, director of the agency, told a news conference on Friday that his biggest concern regarding the physical safety of the facility itself was related to a reliable connection to external power.\nThat connection has been severed at least twice in recent weeks. When the main power lines and the reserve line were damaged by shelling and fires on Aug 25, there was a blackout at the plant, and diesel generators had to be relied on to prevent a disaster.\nThe IAEA said it was informed by Ukraine that it had happened again on Friday night after renewed shelling in the area.\nFighting has raged across southern and eastern Ukraine, and the plant lies precariously close to the front lines of some of the most intense fighting.\nGrossi, who has avoided placing blame for the shelling on either the Russians or Ukrainians, said on Friday that it appeared the power supply to the plant was being deliberately targeted.\n\u201cIt is clear that those who have these military aims, know very well that the way to cripple or to do more damage is not to look into the reactors which are enormously sturdy and robust,\u201d he said.\nInstead, it is being hit where it hurts \u2013 the critical power lines essential for running the plant.\nOne of the six reactors at the plant is currently operational, the agency said, and is producing electricity both for cooling and other essential safety functions at the site and for Ukrainian households and factories.\nNajmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California, said the presence of monitors at the Zaporizhzhia plant was a good thing, but he warned that only time would tell if it changes the behavior of the Russian forces in control of the facility.\nBeyond the radiation risks should there be an accident, it is a vital piece of infrastructure that can power 4 million Ukrainian homes and could continue to be used as leverage by Moscow. Russian forces could wait for international focus to shift and then \u2013 when Ukrainians need the power the most this winter \u2013 \u201cpull the plug on this plant.\u201d THE NEW YORK TIMES"}
