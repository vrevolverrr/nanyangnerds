Manufacturing picked up, as did retail.\u201d\nHowever, a deep property slump remains a major drag on growth, testing the health of heavily indebted local governments and state-owned banks\u2019 balance sheets.\nThe official non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, rose to 53 from 51.4 in February, marking the highest reading since September.\nPremier Li Qiang announced an ambitious 2024 economic growth target of around 5 per cent earlier in March at the annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament.\nBut analysts say policymakers will need to roll out more stimulus to hit that target as they will not be able to count on the low statistical base of 2022 which flattered 2023 growth data.\nCiti on March 28 raised its economic growth forecast for China for 2024 to 5 per cent from 4.6 per cent, citing \u201crecent positive data and policy delivery\u201d.\nChina\u2019s Cabinet on March 1 approved a plan aimed at promoting large-scale equipment upgrades and sales of consumer goods. The head of the country\u2019s state planner told a news conference earlier in March that the plan could generate market demand of more than 5 trillion yuan (S$949 billion) annually.\nMany analysts worry that China may begin flirting with Japan-style stagnation later this decade unless policymakers take steps to reorient the economy towards household consumption and market allocation of resources, and away from the heavy reliance on infrastructure investments seen in the past.
