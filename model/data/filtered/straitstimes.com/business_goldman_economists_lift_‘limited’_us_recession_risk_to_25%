Mr Hatzius\u2019s team expects the central bank will reduce its benchmark by 25 basis points in September, November and December.\nBy contrast, JPMorgan and Citigroup revamped their forecasts to predict policymakers will deliver a half-point cut in September.\nThe Goldman Sachs economists said: \u201cThe premise of our forecast is that jobs growth will recover in August and the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will judge 25 basis-point cuts a sufficient response to any downside risks.\n\u201cIf we are wrong and the August employment report is as weak as the July report, then a 50 basis-point cut would be likely in September.\u201d\nThe economists added that they are sceptical the US labour market is at risk of deteriorating rapidly, in part because job openings indicate demand remains solid and there has been no obvious shock to spark a downturn.
