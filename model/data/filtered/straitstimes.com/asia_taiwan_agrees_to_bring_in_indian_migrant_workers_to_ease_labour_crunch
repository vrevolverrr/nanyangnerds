It did not say how many workers may eventually come, only that the numbers would be decided by Taiwan.\nTaiwan has previously denied reports that up to 100,000 Indian workers may be allowed in.\nIndia, like most countries, has no formal ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan.\nBut there is a close business relationship, with India wanting to encourage more Taiwanese tech companies to invest and manufacture in India.\nIndia also has a difficult relationship with China, especially over their disputed shared border.
