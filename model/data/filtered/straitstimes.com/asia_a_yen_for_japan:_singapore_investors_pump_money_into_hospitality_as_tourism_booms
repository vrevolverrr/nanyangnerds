{"title": "A yen for Japan: Singapore investors pump money into hospitality as tourism booms", "tags": "asia", "timestamp": "2024-04-06", "content": "TOKYO \u2013 From ski resorts and beachside retreats to city hotels and vacant rural homes, Singapore investors have a yen for hospitality purchases in Japan to cash in on its tourism boom.\nThe country has red-hot potential and remains excellent value for money, while offering low barriers to entry for foreigners, they told The Straits Times.\nThis is despite the Bank of Japan\u2019s first monetary policy rate hike in 17 years on March 19, followed by data a week later showing land prices recording their largest surge in over 30 years in 2023.\n\u201cJapan probably will get more expensive, and it should \u2013 because it\u2019s still way too cheap,\u201d Patience Capital Group (PCG) founder Ken Chan, 56, told ST. The fund owns 350ha of land, mainly in Myoko in Niigata, including the country\u2019s second-longest ski run at 8.5km.\n\u201cThe question is, will foreigners not come because it\u2019s more expensive? I think the answer is no. Even if prices go up 20 (per cent) to 30 per cent, it is still very cheap,\u201d added Mr Chan, who used to head Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC in Japan.\nSuch bullish sentiment drove Singapore to become Japan\u2019s top real estate investor in 2023.\nMultimillion-dollar deals were sealed, with newcomers such as IMC Pan Asia Alliance Group and Anglo Fortune Capital Group snapping up their first Japan purchases, while long-time investors like GIC and SC Capital Partners expanded their Japan portfolio.\nIMC is an industrial and shipping conglomerate that also has businesses in real estate \u2013 it co-developed Singapore\u2019s Suntec City complex \u2013 and more recently ventured into hospitality. In 2017, it opened its first \u201cwell-being resort\u201d, Sangha Retreat by Octave, in Suzhou, China.\nIn May 2023, it bought a 30,000 sq m plot of land in Kawana in Shizuoka\u2019s Izu Peninsula offering sweeping bayside views.\nIts chief strategy officer James Ong, 44, told ST that IMC aims to build a hospitality brand in Japan, with the Kawana retreat due to open around 2028, offering about 50 rooms and villas.\nIMC is now looking at properties in Hokkaido and Tokyo. Mr Ong said: \u201cJapan has a robust domestic travel market, and is top of the list of holiday destinations for international tourists. There is also growing attention among Japanese on well-being, paired with a willingness to spend more.\u201d\nWhile IMC wants to build its own brand, property investment advisory Anglo Fortune Capital Group is in it with an eye to maximising profit. Until recently, Anglo Fortune invested exclusively in London, where it traded over \u00a31 billion (S$1.7 billion) worth of real estate before the investment climate began to sour.\nChief executive officer Kin Lee, 49, described Anglo Fortune as a \u201csilent investor\u201d working with well-known hotel brands. \u201cThe reason you\u2019ve never heard of us is that our clients prefer it that way \u2013 everything we do is very silent, very under the radar.\u201d\nMr Lee, who bought the investment firm\u2019s first Japan property in February 2023, is already moving on to the fifth deal in April 2024. Among the properties is a 100-room three-star hotel in the heart of Shibuya, which is now being prepared for sale at \u201cvery handsome\u201d returns.\nMr Lee observed that cities like Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto are becoming too expensive to secure high profit margins, and expects to shift his focus to regions like Fukuoka and Kumamoto. He also intends to focus on Hakuba, a mountainous ski resort in Nagano and site of the 1998 Winter Olympics.\nEarly bird catches the worm\nWith interest rates still at zero per cent to 0.1 per cent, Mr Lee expects the flood of global investment capital to continue.\n\u201cWe are performance-based asset managers, and we need to make money for our clients,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo yes, I\u2019m in a hurry. The early bird catches the worm \u2013 we\u2019re hunting, we\u2019re deploying, but now that we have a track record, we can move faster.\u201d\nThey join other long-time investors like SC Capital Partners, a private equity real estate firm founded in Singapore in 2004 that bought its first Japan property in May 2010 \u2013 the since-sold Comfort Hotel Nihonbashi in Tokyo.\nIn a rare media interview, the firm\u2019s founder Suchad Chiaranussati told ST that Japan accounts for a third of its overall investments through its private real estate funds across the Asia-Pacific.\nIts Japan portfolio now includes hospitality, student accommodation, offices, logistics, residential, corporate housing, retail and, since November 2023, a data centre in Osaka.\nIn 2023, it was part of a consortium that snapped up 27 resort hotels across Japan from Daiwa House Industry in a deal worth about US$900 million (S$1.2 billion). Of these, 23 are being rebranded and refurbished and will open in April 2024 under the brands Mercure and Grand Mercure.\nIn all, SC Capital Partners Group owns 79 hotels in Japan, and has sold another 13.\nBack in 2010 when the company first entered the Japanese market, there were just 8.6 million visitors to Japan. But Mr Chiaranussati was confident that Japan would come to adopt tourism as a key economic strategy, and visitor numbers have since surged nearly four times to a pre-pandemic high of 31.9 million in 2019.\n\u201cOur gut feeling alone is not enough to sustain this in the long term. All our decisions are based on very strong fundamental analyses,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, GIC, which has been investing in Japan since the 1990s, also has a diversified portfolio.\nGIC bought nine logistics facilities in Japan in 2023, while its most recent reported big-ticket hospitality purchase was in 2022 when it snapped up 31 properties from Seibu Holdings. They included The Prince Park Tower Tokyo, located beside the Tokyo Tower, and Naeba Ski Resort in Niigata, which hosts the popular Fuji Rock Festival in the summer.\nGIC is now reportedly considering the sale of the 1,053-room Hilton Fukuoka Sea Hawk Hotel, which it bought in 2007, for over 85 billion yen (S$756 million).\nMr Chan left GIC to found PCG. To raise new capital, PCG has reopened a tourism investment fund that it closed in October 2023 after procuring 35 billion yen, amid fervent interest from investors. The fund will close again in September, and the goal is to grow its equity to 60 billion yen by then, Mr Chan said.\nPCG also owns a 42ha plot of land in Shimoda, Shizuoka, and recently sold the K5 boutique hotel in Tokyo, but it is the plans for ski destination Myoko that have grabbed headlines.\nMore than 10 hotel brands have bid on building resorts in Myoko, with PCG to soon decide on the winners, Mr Chan said. The first resort is due to open by winter in 2028, and Mr Chan sees opportunities, given its accessibility to Tokyo.\n\u201cMyoko is not just a ski resort \u2013 it\u2019s a mountain resort for all seasons,\u201d said Mr Chan. High school runners train in Myoko\u2019s mountains, while Singapore\u2019s EtonHouse is due to hold a summer camp there in 2024. There is also potential for music and wellness festivals.\nWhile prices in the country are set to increase, Mr Chan believes that the time is ripe for Japan to finally recover from its economic stagnation. The influx of investments is healthy, he said, and will be good for the country.\nRedeveloping empty homes\nSingaporeans are also involved in redeveloping akiya (abandoned houses) and kominka (old Japanese-style houses) for holiday rental.\nAttention has grown on these millions of empty homes across Japan.\nMr Steven Liew, the Singaporean director of public policy for the Asia-Pacific at Airbnb, used to live in Fukuoka where he invested in start-ups as a venture capitalist.\nAirbnb has since 2022 donated US$1.25 million to the Japan Kominka Association to support the maintenance and use of old homes in the country. Through this, 25 vacant homes are being refurbished, with 11 properties already listed on the platform.\nMr Liew told ST that Airbnb hopes to \u201cprovide a solution for preserving long-established traditions, local culture, language, art, and history that play an integral role in Japanese society\u201d, while addressing overtourism problems by encouraging inbound tourists to visit lesser-known but equally attractive destinations.\nFellow Singaporean Lester Goh, a 31-year-old architect by training, co-founded Akiya2.0 with an Australian partner in 2023.\nThe firm works with local governments across Japan to preserve and restore vacant homes, in the hope of reviving local communities. These akiya may be converted either into homes for holiday rental, or into cafes or businesses that local regions require.\nMr Goh envisions \u201cclusters\u201d of about 15 to 20 renovated akiya in each area. Akiya2.0 already has property in Wajima on the Noto Peninsula and Shimanami Kaido, a 60km road connecting islands in the Seto Inland Sea that has been described as a cyclist\u2019s dream.\nThe first project was to be in Wajima, but Akiya2.0 has postponed this so as not to divert resources from the city\u2019s recovery efforts after the 7.6-magnitude earthquake that struck on New Year\u2019s Day, Mr Goh said. It has turned its attention instead to Shimanami Kaido, and is buying property along the route with an eye to a launch by end-2024.\n\u201cWe are seeking places that are convenient for tourists and yet remain untouched,\u201d said the Japan resident since 2019. \u201cWe are also actively speaking to local residents, listening to and taking in their opinions.\u201d\nCorrection note: An earlier version of the story misstated the age of PCG founder Ken Chan. This has been corrected. We are sorry for the error."}
