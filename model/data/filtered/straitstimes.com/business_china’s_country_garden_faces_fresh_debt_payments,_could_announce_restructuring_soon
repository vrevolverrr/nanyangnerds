If it defaults, these debts will need to be restructured, and the company or its assets also risk liquidation by creditors.\nChina\u2019s property sector has been hit by a debt crisis since 2021. Companies accounting for 40 per cent of Chinese home sales \u2013 mostly private property developers \u2013 have defaulted on debt obligations, leaving many homes unfinished.\nMore than two years on, the crisis has deepened as confidence in both housing and capital markets dried up, further squeezing developers\u2019 liquidity.\nBeijing has rolled out a range of support measures in recent months to revive the sector, which makes up about a quarter of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nSome analysts, however, say more measures are needed.\nIn a research note last Friday, UBS said property sales growth in major cities likely stayed weak in September, suggesting a limited rebound in sales despite more supportive measures to ease the property crisis.\nChina\u2019s average daily home sales based on floor area during the Golden Week holiday were down 17 per cent from a year ago, according to China Index Academy last Saturday.\nIn September, Country Garden won approval from its onshore creditors to extend renminbi bond payments and, in the same month, made coupon payments on the offshore markets in the last hours of a grace period.\nBut the developer has not yet paid a US$15 million coupon due on Sept 17 and a US$40 million coupon due on Sept 27, both of which have 30-day grace periods.
