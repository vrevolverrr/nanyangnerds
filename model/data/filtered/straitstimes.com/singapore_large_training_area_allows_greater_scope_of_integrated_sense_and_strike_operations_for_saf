I\u2019m now extremely confident that the rigorous training I\u2019ve undergone as an air crew member has prepared me well and equipped me with the necessary skill sets.\u201d\nThat was the same feeling Corporal Aide Alfian Abdul Rahman, 20, had after participating in the exercise.\nThe Himars operator said he was apprehensive about the live firing in the US, since he had not experienced one involving rocket launchers before.\nBut upon completing it, the NSF realised that he had no reason to worry, with the experience cementing his \u201cfull faith\u201d in his battery mates, with whom he had trained hard in Singapore for months prior to the live firing.\n\u201cBeing here has made me feel a lot more grateful for the peace that we enjoy in Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMoving forward, I intend to work harder... in (my) everyday life, because you never know if (what we have) could change.\u201d"}
