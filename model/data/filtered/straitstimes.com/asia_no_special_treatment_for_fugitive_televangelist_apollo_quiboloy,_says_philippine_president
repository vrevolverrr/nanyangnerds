At the end of the day, whether he likes it or not, the end result will ultimately be the same.\u201d\nInterior Minister Benjamin Abalos Jr. told the same briefing that the government was looking to file charges against people who helped Quiboloy evade arrest.\nQuiboloy is also a long-time friend of former president Rodrigo Duterte, who has filed a criminal complaint against Mr Abalos and several police officers for damaging Quiboloy\u2019s property.\nMr Marcos said Quiboloy\u2019s camp had set conditions for his surrender, including a guarantee he would not be sent to the US to face charges.\n\u201cPutting conditions is not an option for someone who is a fugitive,\u201d Mr Marcos said, describing the law enforcement operation to capture Quiboloy as \u201cpolice work at its best\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cIt is with some relief that I can say that this phase of the operation is over. We will now leave Quiboloy to the judicial system.\u201d\nThe Philippines\u2019 Department of Justice acknowledged the country\u2019s extradition treaty with the US but said in a statement on Sept 9 that Quiboloy will first face trial and serve any sentence in the Philippines before any extradition request is granted.
