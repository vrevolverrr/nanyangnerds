But the spread of the virus to 129 dairy herds in 12 US states signals a change that could bring it closer to becoming transmissible between humans. Infections also have been found in other mammals, from alpacas to house cats.\n\u201cIt almost seems like a pandemic unfolding in slow motion,\u201d said Professor Scott Hensley, who teaches microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cRight now, the threat is pretty low\u2026 but that could change in a heartbeat.\u201d\nThe earlier the warning of a jump to humans, the sooner global health officials can take steps to protect people by launching vaccine development, wide-scale testing and containment measures.\nFederal surveillance of US dairy cows is currently limited to testing herds before they cross state lines. State testing efforts are inconsistent, while testing of people exposed to sick cattle is scant, government health officials and pandemic flu experts told Reuters.\n\u201cYou need to know which are the positive farms, how many of the cows are positive, how well the virus spreads, how long do these cows remain infectious, the exact transmission route,\u201d said Dutch flu virologist Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam.\nDr Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said surveillance for humans is \u201cvery, very limited\u201d.\nShe described the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) human flu surveillance network as \u201creally a passive reporting, passive presentation mechanism\u201d. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is more proactive in testing cows, but does not make public which farms are affected, she said.\nSeveral experts said differing approaches from animal and human health agencies could hamper a quicker response.\n\u201cIf you were designing the system from scratch, you would have one agency,\u201d said Dr Gigi Gronvall, a biosecurity expert at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security. \u201cThis is not the only example where we have environmental or animal problems that cause human problems.\u201d\nA USDA spokesman said the agency is working \u201caround the clock\u201d with CDC and other partners in a \u201cwhole-of-government response\u201d, adding that ongoing research shows \u201cAmerica\u2019s food supply remains safe, sick cows generally recover after a few weeks, and the risk to human health remains low\u201d.\nThe CDC in a statement said it, the USDA and state and local health departments across the country \u201chave been preparing for the emergence of a novel influenza virus for nearly two decades and continually monitor for even the smallest changes in the virus\u201d.\n\u2018A note of caution\u2019\nSome pandemics, including Covid-19, arrive with little warning.\nIn the last flu pandemic, caused by H1N1 in 2009, the virus and its predecessors had first spread among animals for several years, Prof Hensley said, but more surveillance would have helped health the authorities prepare.\nThree people in the US have tested positive for H5N1 avian flu since late March after contact with cows, experiencing mild symptoms. One person in Mexico was infected with a separate H5 strain not previously seen in humans, and with no known exposure to animals. Other cases were reported in India, China and Australia, caused by different strains.\nThe World Health Organisation says H5N1\u2018s risk to humans is low because there is no evidence of human transmission. Some tools are available if that changes, including limited amounts of existing H5N1 vaccine and antiviral medications like Tamiflu.\nThere are mechanisms to launch larger-scale production of tests, treatments and vaccines, if needed, said the UN agency\u2019s head of flu, Dr Wenqing Zhang.\nOther experts said there is sufficient concern to start preparing for potential spread in humans, although triggers for taking action differ depending on the role played in the response, said Mr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). His organisation acted early on funding Covid-19 vaccine development, and is now in talks with research partners about H5N1.\nCEPI aims to create a library of prototype vaccines for pathogens with pandemic potential. This would help drugmakers initiate large-scale production and distribute shots where necessary within 100 days of an outbreak.\nSome countries are taking steps to protect people against H5N1. The United States and Europe are securing doses of \u201cpre-pandemic\u201d flu vaccine that could be used for high-risk groups, including farm or lab workers. Finland is expected to become the first country to inoculate fur and poultry farm workers, as well as animal health response workers.\nExpanding vaccine access is also complex, said the WHO\u2019s Dr Zhang. Manufacturers of potential pandemic flu vaccines make seasonal flu shots and cannot produce both at once, she said.\nSince most flu vaccines are made using virus grown in eggs, it could take up to six months to produce pandemic shots. The US is in talks with Moderna to use their faster mRNA technology for pandemic flu shots.\nThe experts all acknowledged a need to balance acting quickly to avert a threat versus overreacting.\n\u201cWe want to sound a note of caution,\u201d said Dr Wendy Barclay, a virologist at University College London who researches avian flu for the UK Health Security Agency, \u201cwithout saying the world is about to end\u201d.
