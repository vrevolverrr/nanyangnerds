Who are you representing?\"\nWhen the safe distancing ambassador says she represents MBS, the woman replies: \"That's what you say, I can say that I'm a police (officer).\"\nIn the rest of the one-and-a-half-minute video, the safe distancing ambassador repeatedly tries to get the woman to put on a mask to no avail.\nThe woman also repeatedly questions the safe distancing ambassador about a badge.\nAt the end of the video, the woman can be seen clutching a mask which she slides into her pocket.\nThe police said the woman is believed to be involved in other similar instances where she was in various buildings and establishments without a mask on."}
