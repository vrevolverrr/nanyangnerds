He expects pharmaceuticals to rebound in the coming months.\nHe is more disappointed about the weakness of electronics exports, particularly for integrated circuits (ICs), also referred to as chips or semiconductors.\nYear on year, electronics exports resumed their decline, falling by 9.4 per cent in March, snapping two months of expansion in February (5.2 per cent) and January (0.6 per cent).\nTelecommunications equipment, ICs, and diodes and transistors contributed the most to the drop.\nTelecommunications equipment fell by 38.8 per cent ($100 million\u200b\u200b), diodes and transistors by 11 per cent, and ICs \u2013 which formed about half of electronics Nodx \u2013 gave up 8 per cent ($100 million\u200b\u200b).\nICs are a vital component of various electronic devices. ANZ had expected the IC segment to do better, as it rode on the upswing in the global semiconductor cycle.\n\u201cSingapore is definitely lagging behind South Korea and Taiwan in a big way,\u201d Mr Goh added.\nCapital Economics\u2019 Mr Tandon said South Korea and Taiwan are benefiting from robust demand for high-end memory chips and chips used in artificial intelligence servers.\nHe added that while Singapore will benefit from an uptick in demand in the electronics sector, \u201cthe gains are limited compared to those for South Korea and Taiwan\u201d.\nOn a more upbeat note, DBS economist Chua Han Teng said the ongoing expansion in new export orders for the headline and electronics manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 indexes suggests that Singapore\u2019s overseas shipments should see better prospects in 2024.\nOverall new export orders rose for the sixth straight month in March, while those for electronics climbed for the fourth consecutive month, Mr Chua said.\nThe new export orders readings track foreign demand for Singapore\u2019s goods and services.\nOn a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, which removes the effects of seasonal variations in the numbers, Nodx fell by 8.4 per cent in March, sharper than the 4.9 per cent decline in February.\nIn value terms, March Nodx came to $13 billion, lower than the previous month\u2019s $14.2 billion and the year-ago level of $15.7 billion.\nBy markets, shipments to Singapore\u2019s top 10 markets fell, with the main hits coming from the United States, the European Union and Japan.\nShipments of pharmaceuticals and structures of ships and boats led to the 50.2 per cent decline in exports to the US.\nNodx to the EU contracted by 45.4 per cent, due also to pharmaceuticals, specialised machinery and telecommunications equipment.\nBut Nodx to China grew 11.9 per cent in March, after falling 0.1 per cent in the previous month. Hong Kong (16.5 per cent growth) and Taiwan (2 per cent growth) were also bright spots.\nMr Goh expects shipments to China to grow due to low base effects from 2023 and the improving Chinese economy. Official data on April 16 showed the Chinese economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace of 5.3 per cent year on year in the first quarter of 2024.\nMr Tandon is not as optimistic, saying he expects the Chinese economy to enter a \u201crenewed slowdown in the second half of the year\u201d. This will keep a lid on exports from Singapore, he said.\nHe added that weaker global growth, driven by the \u201cfading resilience of the US economy\u201d, will weigh on Singapore\u2019s export-oriented economy in the coming quarters.\nEnterpriseSG had forecast in February that Singapore\u2019s exports would grow by 4 per cent to 6 per cent in 2024, up from its November projection of a 2 per cent to 4 per cent increase.\nMr Chua said ongoing global uncertainties could contribute to a fragile exports recovery. Downside risks could come from regional conflicts, geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over economic policy, he said."}
