But further incidents in recent months of what appear to be Russian spy ships operating near allied systems have heightened concern.\nAdmiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo, the head of the Portuguese Navy, told state-owned broadcaster RTP in March that a Russian vessel near the Portuguese island region of Madeira was a spy ship that was following and measuring submarine cables.\nRussian patrols\nA joint investigation published in April by Danish, Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian public broadcasters said that Russian military and civilian ships were mapping seabed infrastructure in the Baltic and North seas.\nRussia\u2019s \u201cpatrols into the Atlantic and throughout the Atlantic are at a high level, most of the time at a higher level than what we\u2019ve seen in recent years\u201d, Mr Cattler said.\nHe added that Russia appears to be targeting undersea infrastructure in the broad Atlantic, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.\nMr Cattler pointed to Russia\u2019s military strategy \u2013 which calls for rapid destruction of critical infrastructure in the early stages of a conflict, a tactic seen in Ukraine \u2013 as one reason for the heightened concern.\nReconnaissance programme\nMoscow\u2019s efforts are led in part by an underwater reconnaissance programme in the Ministry of Defence and are supported by military and civilian intelligence services, with considerable resources at their disposal across the digital, space, air, land and maritime domains, he said.\nWhile China is also active in the domain, Mr Cattler said, it is more interested in buying infrastructure than testing the vulnerabilities of others. He added that threats also exist from terrorists and other groups, particularly where the cables or infrastructure meet land."}
