The potentially fatal virus affects the respiratory system, often resulting in a skin rash.\nResponding to queries from The Straits Times, MOH said Singapore\u2019s population has a high level of immunity against measles and the likelihood of a large outbreak is low because of high vaccination coverage for the virus here.\nOn Nov 23, the WHO and the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flagged the risk of measles spreading in various regions around the world.\nThey attributed the threat to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to a decline in vaccination coverage and weakened surveillance of the disease, coupled with large and persistent outbreaks in 2022.\nThe virus is almost entirely preventable by vaccination and requires at least 95 per cent of a population to receive two doses of measles vaccine to achieve herd immunity, they noted.\nHowever, vaccination across the world is well under this level, with only 81 per cent of children receiving their first measles-containing vaccine dose and only 71 per cent of children getting their second, WHO and the US public health agency said.\nA record high of nearly 40 million children missed a measles vaccine dose in 2021, raising the risk of the highly infectious respiratory virus re-emerging around the world, they noted.\nIn Singapore, first vaccine dose coverage for the population has been consistently above 95 per cent from 2011 to 2021, with second dose coverage hovering around 90 per cent, MOH said.\nThe ministry strongly encouraged parents to ensure that their young children receive two doses of the MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccination on schedule and as recommended by their medical practitioners.\nMeasles vaccination is mandatory by law for all children living in Singapore.\nMOH also recommended vaccination for adults \u2013 who are also susceptible to the virus \u2013 who are not protected. This includes those who have not received both doses of the MMR vaccination or have not had measles infection previously.\nAs at Nov 26, Singapore has recorded three cases of measles for 2022, according to MOH\u2019s website."}
