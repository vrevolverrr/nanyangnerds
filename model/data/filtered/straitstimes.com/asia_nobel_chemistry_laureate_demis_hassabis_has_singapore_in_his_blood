Both were reported to have worked as teachers.\nHe described his parents in a 2014 interview with The Standard of London as \u201cquite bohemian\u201d. At the time, his mother was working for the department store chain John Lewis, while his father \u201cdid lots of different things\u201d, including being a singer-songwriter.\n\u201cNeither of them are technical at all, which is quite bizarre,\u201d Dr Hassabis told The Standard.\n\u201cMy parents are technophobes. They don\u2019t really like computers... So, yeah, it\u2019s weird. I\u2019m not quite sure where all this came from,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2016.\nHe said, like his parents, his younger brother and sister \u201cwent the artistic route\u201d. His sister is a composer and pianist, while his brother studied creative writing.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely the alien black sheep in my family,\u201d he said in jest, recalling how as a boy he spent his chess prize winnings on a ZX Spectrum 48K, and then a Commodore Amiga, which he promptly took apart and figured out how to program.\nHe stood out\nGrowing up, Dr Hassabis was often described as a polymath. He taught himself to write computer programs when he was just eight.\nHe was the second-highest ranked under-14 chess player in the world and began designing video games professionally before attending college.\nAfter completing a computer science degree at the University of Cambridge, he founded his own video game company and then returned to academia for a doctorate in neuroscience.\nDr Hassabis, along with a fellow academic and a childhood friend, founded an AI start-up that they called DeepMind in 2010. About four years later, Google acquired it for US$650 million (S$848 million).\nHis Singapore years\nDr Hassabis credits his years in Singapore \u2013 where he spent his summers until he turned 10 \u2013 for sparking in him a keen interest in tech, particularly in video games.\n\u201cBack in the early 80s, there were so many cool gadgets that were coming from Japan that you could buy in Singapore that you couldn\u2019t buy in Britain. I remember getting Nintendo Game and Watch\u2019s Donkey Kong. That was my favourite,\u201d he told The Straits Times in a 2016 interview.\nHe said he has always seen Singapore \u201cas this magical futuristic world\u201d.\nAsked what it would take for the city state to woo a trailblazer like him, he replied: \u201cYou need to create enough of a critical mass of people that you can build a company like DeepMind out of\u201d.\n\u201cYou probably got enough of the ingredients,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou got money, government will, and very smart people and top universities and it\u2019s a highly technological society. You may just need the right entrepreneur or leader to pull it all together,\u201d he added.\nOn receiving the Nobel prize, Dr Hassabis told Reuters \u201cit\u2019s totally surreal, to be honest, quite overwhelming\u201d.\nWeighing in on the simmering debate over AI, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s like any powerful, general-purpose technology. It can be used for harm as well if put in the wrong hands and used for the wrong ends\u201d."}
