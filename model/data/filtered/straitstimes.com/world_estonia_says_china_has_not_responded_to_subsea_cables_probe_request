We submitted a legal aid request to the Chinese authorities to gather evidence from the vessel and its crew\u201d, she added.\nThere was no immediate reply from the Chinese embassy to a Reuters email seeking comment on Ms Olev\u2019s remarks.\nEstonia believes the vessel belongs to a Chinese company, Ms Olev said.\nThe request was sent on Nov 10, her spokesperson told Reuters in December.\nA separate legal assistance request was sent to China by the Finnish investigation, he said.\nReuters has reported that the vessel was present at all three sites around the time of their damage, on its way to a port near St Petersburg, Russia, according to data from MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking and maritime analytics provider.\nA large anchor, believed to belong to the Chinese vessel, was found near the pipeline, and the investigators said the pipe and the telecoms cables were likely broken as the anchor was dragged across the sea bed.\nFinland\u2019s National Bureau of Investigation told Reuters in April it has \u201ccooperated with Chinese authorities in solving\u201d the damage to the pipeline, adding, \u201cthere is progress in the investigation\u201d.\nChina said in October it was willing to provide the gas pipeline investigation the necessary information in accordance with international law. Russia has dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d the idea that it was involved.\nNewNew Polar Bear has been anchored in China\u2019s Tianjin port since returning from Russia in December, according to MarineTraffic data.\nNato stepped up its patrols in the Baltic Sea in 2023 after the incidents, and the Norwegian Navy shadowed the NewNew Polar Bear as it sailed over the country\u2019s key gas pipelines.
