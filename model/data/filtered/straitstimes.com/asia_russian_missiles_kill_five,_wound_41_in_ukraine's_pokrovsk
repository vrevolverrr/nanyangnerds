His son was killed while driving, and his grandson was hospitalised. \"My son, he is dead already, it's done,\" he said, weeping.\nSix cars and 16 private houses were damaged, and one house was destroyed, Filashkin said.\nRussian troops launched two Iskander-M ballistic missiles at the town which is about 24 km from the frontline, he added. The strikes were half an hour apart, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office said.\nThe attack left a huge crater in front of houses with shattered windows and smashed rooftops.\nOlha, 58, was inside her house when the second missile landed.\n\"I already started running around here, confused, and I get out - there was such screaming after the second strike... a boy, passer-by likely, was lying covered in blood,\" she told Reuters.
