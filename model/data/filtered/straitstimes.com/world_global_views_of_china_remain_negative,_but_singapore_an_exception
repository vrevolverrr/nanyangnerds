Negative views of China hit or remain near historic highs in most advanced economies compared with last year, and a median of only 27 per cent across the 17 populations have a favourable opinion of China.\nIn contrast, 64 per cent of Singaporeans have a favourable view of China.\nThis stands out from the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, where a median of 73 per cent see China in a negative light. Japan has the most negative views, with roughly nine in 10 seeing China negatively. And two-thirds or more in Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand have mostly negative views of China.\nWhile views of China have remained largely negative, positive views of the US have rebounded since last year, when Republican President Donald Trump was in office and the country was hit hard by the pandemic.\nIn summer last year, a median of 34 per cent across 13 countries had favourable views of the US, while 24 per cent viewed China positively.\nNow, a median of 61 per cent have favourable views of America, compared with the 27 per cent for China.\n\"These broadly positive views reflect a significant shift since last summer, when ratings of the US were at or near historic lows in most countries,\" the Pew report noted.\nCorrespondingly, confidence in Mr Xi to do the right thing in world affairs stayed at or near historic lows in most places, while confidence in America's president rose substantially since Democrat Joe Biden took office early this year.\nA median of 77 per cent had no confidence in Mr Xi, although 70 per cent of Singaporeans surveyed expressed confidence in him - the same level of confidence as they had in Mr Biden."}
