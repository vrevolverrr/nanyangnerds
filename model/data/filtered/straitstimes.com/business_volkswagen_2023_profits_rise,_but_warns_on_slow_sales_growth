Sales meanwhile grew more than 15 per cent to \u20ac322.3 billion.\nThe 10-brand group \u2013 which includes Audi, Porsche and Skoda \u2013 saw particularly strong sales in Europe and North America.\nIn China, sales grew modestly but at a slower than in 2023, offering the latest evidence that Volkswagen is losing ground in its most important market.\nVolkswagen has fallen behind domestic competitors in China, losing its title as the best-selling auto brand to BYD.\nThe auto giant\u2019s outlook for 2024 was also very subdued. It expects vehicle deliveries to advance in 2024, forecasting a modest increase of up to 3 per cent due to tougher international competition and potential supply chain problems.\nSales growth is similarly expected to come in at 5 per cent, well down on 2023.\n\u201cThe persistently high inflation in major economic regions and the resulting restrictive monetary policy measures taken by central banks are expected to dampen consumer demand,\u201d it warned.\n\u201cContinuing geopolitical tensions and conflicts are weighing on growth prospects; risks are associated in particular with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the confrontations in the Middle East.\u201d\nStalling electric shift\nVolkswagen also warned there could be decreases in demand, \u201cpossibly exacerbated by media reports or insufficient communication\u201d.\nThe carmaker came under fresh pressure in February over its operations in China\u2019s troubled Xinjiang region, after the Handelsblatt financial daily reported that forced labour may have been used to build a test track there in 2019.\nFollowing the report, Volkswagen said it was in talks with its Chinese joint-venture partner SAIC \u201cabout the future direction of business activities in Xinjiang\u201d.\nVolkswagen chief executive Oliver Blume said on March 13 that the company takes such allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d but \u201cso far, we have not been able to confirm the information\u201d provided.\nIn terms of the operation\u2019s future, Mr Blume insisted Volkswagen had a \u201cresponsibility\u201d towards the employees in the joint venture in Xinjiang.\nVolkswagen in 2023 singled out China and the United States as key markets for its future growth, and it is also looking to increase profit margins."}
