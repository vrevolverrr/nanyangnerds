It would also bring together a more than 90,000-person strong workforce to go out and win business with companies of all sizes.\nNo final decisions have been made and details of any potential restructuring could still change, the people said. A spokesperson for HSBC declined to comment.\nHSBC shares briefly spiked on the news on Sept 9 before paring those gains to close up 2.1 per cent in London.\nHSBC executives have considered a tie-up of the commercial and global banking divisions in the past, but the proposal was previously met with heavy internal resistance and former HSBC CEO Noel Quinn was opposed to the idea, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.\nMr Quinn, who rose through the ranks of the commercial bank, has previously argued that combining the coverage teams of the two divisions would be too disruptive, the people familiar with the matter said.\nAfter Mr Quinn\u2019s departure earlier in September, the idea is being given a fresh look as the company hunts for ways to simplify its business, the people said.\nThe combined unit would be home to about 92,125 employees in total, though some executives believe the tie-up could allow the bank to eliminate some duplicative back-office roles, the people said.\nCommercial banking, which has offerings for small and mid-sized businesses in 50 markets, posted a profit before tax of US$13.3 billion in 2023, while the global banking and markets arm brought in US$5.9 billion. Wealth and personal banking, which caters to 41 million consumers around the world, generated about US$11.5 billion.\nExpenses in check\nMr Elhedery\u2019s deliberations come as HSBC has been looking to rein in expenses, with central banks around the world beginning to cut interest rates, moves that threaten the margins of big, global lenders.\nIn his initial meetings with staff, Mr Elhedery has emphasised that staff should seek to keep their expenses in check, Bloomberg previously reported. The bank has already started to slow hiring and asked bankers\u2019 to be more judicious about their travel and entertainment spending.\nThe former chief financial officer has also considered plans that could remove layers of middle management at Europe\u2019s largest bank, mirroring similar moves undertaken by rivals Citigroup and Standard Chartered Bank.\nCombining commercial banking with global banking and markets would follow a similar move by JPMorgan earlier in 2024. There, CEO Jamie Dimon tapped Ms Jenn Piepszak and Mr Troy Rohrbaugh to lead an expanded commercial and investment bank, which included the firm\u2019s commercial bank, investment banking, corporate banking, markets, securities services and global payments.\nOn the other hand, HSBC\u2019s rival Citigroup recently broke up its so-called institutional clients group into three smaller units \u2013 a banking division, a markets unit and a services group \u2013 as part of CEO Jane Fraser\u2019s ongoing revamp of the lender.
