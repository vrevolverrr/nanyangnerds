Kim.\nShares in Sands China plunged 9 per cent, while shares in Melco International, Wynn Macau, SJM , Galaxy, MGM China dropped between 6 per cent and 7 per cent.\nMacau has recorded around 1,500 Covid-19 infections since mid-June. Around 19,000 people are in mandatory quarantine as the government adheres to China\u2019s zero-Covid-19 policy, which aims to stamp out all outbreaks, running counter to a global trend of trying to coexist with the virus.\nMore than 30 zones in the city that have been deemed high risk are now under lockdown, meaning that no one is allowed to enter or exit for at least five days. While the government said it was not imposing a citywide lockdown, the stringent measures mean Macau is effectively closed.\nCasinos were last shut in Macau in February 2020 for 15 days.\nThe government has previously been hesitant to close casinos due to its mandate to protect jobs. The industry employs most of the population directly and indirectly, and accounts for more than 80 per cent of government revenues.\nFrustration is mounting over the government\u2019s handling of the outbreak. Fights have broken out at testing centres, while some residents have had to queue for more than 20 hours to access healthcare facilities."}
