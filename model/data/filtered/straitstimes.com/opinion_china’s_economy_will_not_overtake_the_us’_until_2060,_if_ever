But underlying trends \u2013 bad demographics, heavy debt and declining productivity growth \u2013 suggest the country\u2019s overall growth potential is about half that rate.\nThe implications of China growing at 2.5 per cent have yet to be fully digested anywhere, including Beijing. For one thing, assuming that the United States grows at 1.5 per cent, with similar rates of inflation and a stable exchange rate, China would not overtake America as the world\u2019s largest economy until 2060, if ever."}
