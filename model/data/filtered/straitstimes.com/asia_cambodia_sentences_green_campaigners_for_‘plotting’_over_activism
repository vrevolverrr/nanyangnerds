Ahead of the verdict, the four activists and a few dozen supporters had marched to the court in a mock funeral procession wearing white, a colour of mourning.\n\u201cWe cannot see the justice anywhere because we did not do anything wrong,\u201d Mother Nature member Phuon Keoraksmey, 23, told reporters outside the Phnom Penh court.\nThe group comprised just young people working for social justice and to \u201cprotect natural resources\u201d, she added.\nMr Am Sam Ath said the verdict was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.\nHe told AFP: \u201cToday, the court has ruled that youth activists fighting for environmental protections and democratic principles are in effect acting against the state.\u201d\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) in June condemned the trial as an attempt to \u201cmuzzle criticism of governmental policies\u201d.\nHRW said Mother Nature had campaigned for more than a decade against damaging infrastructure projects and \u201cexposed corruption in the management of Cambodia\u2019s natural resources\u201d.\nThe charges against the 10 activists related to Mother Nature\u2019s activism between 2012 and 2021.\nThe group raised issues around the filling in of lakes in Phnom Penh, illegal logging, and the destruction of natural resources across the country.\nThe tussle over protecting or exploiting Cambodia\u2019s natural resources has long been a contentious issue in the kingdom, with environmentalists threatened, arrested and even killed in the past decade.\nThree of the activists sentenced on July 2 had previously been jailed for organising a peaceful march protesting against the filling in of a lake in the capital to create land for real estate developments.\nFrom 2001 to 2015, a third of Cambodia\u2019s primary forests \u2013 some of the world\u2019s most biodiverse and a key carbon sink \u2013 were cleared, and tree cover loss accelerated faster than anywhere else in the world, according to the World Resources Institute.\nMuch of the cleared land has been granted to businesses in concessions that experts say have driven deforestation and dispossession in the country.
