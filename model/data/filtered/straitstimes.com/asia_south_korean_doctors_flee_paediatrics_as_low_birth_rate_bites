It felt like the sky was falling.\u201d\nDr Song Dae-jin at Korea University Guro Hospital said he worried that staff shortages could soon cripple his team\u2019s ability to provide emergency care.\n\u201cAt this rate, we won\u2019t be able to last the year,\u201d Dr Song said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal if mild diseases are not seen for a day or two but the consequences of not seeing serious diseases or emergency patients in a timely manner can be devastating.\u201d\nA five-year-old boy with a respiratory infection died in May after failing to find a hospital bed, sparking a public outcry.\n\u201cPatients dying while bouncing around multiple emergency rooms, dying when it\u2019s not a serious disease, it\u2019s a travesty,\u201d said Dr Choi Yong-jae, vice-president of the Korea Children\u2019s Hospital Association.\n\u2018I\u2019m worried\u2019\nDoctors say the low-fee problem is particular to paediatrics as the insurance system has not been revised to reflect fewer child patients. When more babies were growing up, paediatricians could sustain a low-price, high-volume model, but that does not apply now.\n\u201cIn foreign countries, the government pays enough to maintain the hospital even if you see 20 patients a day,\u201d said Dr Lim Hyun-taek, president of the Korean Paediatric Association, who said fees had not been raised significantly for 30 years.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s about US$10 (S$13.50) per treatment in South Korea, so clinics have to see about 80 patients a day.\u201d\nBy comparison, it costs about A$335 (S$300) for initial standard consultation with an Australian paediatrician, while observation at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in the US costs US$208 per hour, according to its website.\nThe South Korean Health Ministry said measures had been introduced in 2023 on fees and insurance compensation to supplement \u201climitations\u201d. It said it had proposed more state-backed centres and requirements for major hospitals to maintain emergency paediatric treatment.\n\u201cWe understand that there are opinions from doctors saying it is not enough to cope with difficulties in the field. The government plans to steadily implement and continue to supplement the announced measures,\u201d it said.\nData from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service shows paediatricians are South Korea\u2019s lowest-paid doctors, making 57 per cent less than the average doctor\u2019s salary.\nHospitals are feeling the crunch.\nSowha Hospital, South Korea\u2019s oldest children\u2019s hospital, recently suspended Saturday afternoon and Sunday treatment for the first time in 77 years owing to a lack of staff.\nSome hospitals have reduced night-time treatment and shut children\u2019s emergency rooms.\nThe situation is so alarming that some couples say it is adding to their doubts about having babies despite government efforts to reverse the sliding birth rate with billions of dollars a year on childcare subsidies.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d said Ms Kim Eun-ji, a 34-year-old mother of a baby boy, referring to the prospect of a second child.\n\u201cIf the number of children\u2019s hospitals decreases and the number of doctors falls, it\u2019s going to be difficult to get children treated.\u201d\n\u2018Too risky\u2019\nEchoing that, Namseoul University professor of health administration Lee Ju-yul said the failure to allocate resources to paediatric care undermined the impact of the \u201chuge\u201d amounts spent on boosting the birth rate.\n\u201cWe must take some of the budget so parents feel there\u2019s going to be no difficulty with healthcare when they give birth,\u201d Prof Lee said.\nThe Korean Paediatric Association recently organised a seminar for hundreds of members looking to switch into new areas, including the booming beauty business.\nIts president, Dr Lim, said paediatrics was just too much of a gamble given the income prospects.\n\u201cSome doctors love to treat children... Now, it\u2019s too risky,\u201d he said. REUTERS"}
