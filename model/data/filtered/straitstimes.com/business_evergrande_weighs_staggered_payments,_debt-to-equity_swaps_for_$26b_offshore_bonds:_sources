The restructuring proposals are, however, at an early stage and are subject to change, the source added.\nEvergrande is reeling under more than US$300 billion in liabilities and has become the poster child of the country\u2019s property sector crisis as it lurched from one missed payment deadline to another last year.\nThe developer\u2019s woes quickly led to a wave of defaults in China\u2019s property sector, a key pillar for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, rattling investors and leading to a slump in home sales and firms struggling to access funding.\nWhile state intervention has quelled market concern over a disorderly collapse of Evergrande, which has also struggled to repay suppliers and complete projects and homes, investors are still in the dark over whether they will recoup their money.\nEvergrande, which began talks with offshore bond holders earlier this year about the restructuring proposal, aims to finalise the plan by July and sign the agreements with investors by December, said the first source.\n\u201c(Evergrande) chairman Hui Ka Yan hopes the bond holders will accept the proposal, as there are not many assets offshore that can be sold immediately to pay off the debts,\u201d said the source.\nIt is not immediately clear how Evergrande will be able to secure sufficient cash to implement the cash repayment plan. The company saw contracted sales plunged by 39 per cent in 2021 from the previous year.\nTwo offshore Evergrande bond holders said they were more inclined to pick the debt-to-equity swap option, as they do not hold high hopes that the developer will be able to make full repayment in cash even within a promised extended timetable.\nMost Evergrande dollar bonds had fallen below 10 cents on the dollar as at Friday morning (May 27). One of the bond holders said that most creditors, particularly the hedge funds, may prefer taking a haircut for the swap than go for extended notes.\n\u201cThe distressed funds... they just want out,\u201d said the bond holder, adding that the views were very split in the creditors group and no consensus has been reached yet."}
