After wildfires ravaged the Hawaiian island of Maui in 2023, accounts linked to China pushed conspiratorial posts blaming the US government for the blazes and featured images of burning coastal roads generated by artificial intelligence, according to a Microsoft report earlier in 2024.\nMr Musk and Trump, his preferred presidential candidate, have promoted conspiracies about missing mail-in ballots and alleged that government agencies have failed to provide relief to affected areas.\nUS Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, wrote on X, \u201cYes they can control the weather\u201d, drawing 43 million views.\nWhile Ms Greene never elaborated on who \u201cthey\u201d were, long-established conspiracy theories have held that the US government is capable of bringing about extreme weather events such as hurricanes to directly benefit either their allies or themselves.\nThe ISD, which studies disinformation worldwide, cited 33 posts on X \u2013 featuring claims debunked by Fema \u2013 that generated more than 160 million views by Oct 7.\nPosts on X with anti-Semitic content \u2013 including attacks on public officials such as the mayor of Asheville, a Fema spokesman and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas \u2013 drew 17.1 million views as at Oct 7.\nISD identified crossover between online networks that specialise in denial of climate change and other extremist movements that previously pushed false claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio and Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, among other contentious topics.\nNational security agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Office of the Director of National Intelligence are on alert for foreign influence operations that seize on the storms as a way to sow division in the country, according to a US official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\nTrump accused Ms Harris on Oct 9 of having \u201cled the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina\u201d and repeated a false claim that the Biden administration stole money from Fema\u2019s disaster fund to house illegal migrants.\n\u201cThe only misinformation is coming from the Harris-Biden administration,\u201d said Ms Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman.\nPresident Joe Biden pushed back on Oct 9 night, accusing Trump, Ms Greene and others of spreading misinformation: \u201cQuite frankly, these lies are un-American.\u201d\nMs Harris intends to continue challenging Trump\u2019s claims and to link his promotion of disinformation to voters\u2019 doubts about his character, according to an adviser for the Vice-President who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nFema officials devoted their pre-storm briefing on Oct 8 to addressing deceptive claims about the storm response \u2013 an effort that includes a new website aimed at debunking online rumours.\nFema administrator Deanne Criswell, who has spent decades in emergency management, said the false rhetoric had reached a \u201clevel I\u2019ve never seen before\u201d.\nThe White House has used a Reddit account with posts directing victims of Hurricane Helene to federal resources and summarising the administration\u2019s preparations for Hurricane Milton.\nIt also published a fact-check of some of the most common false claims that Trump and some other Republicans are amplifying.\nTrump\u2019s attacks have made bedfellows of the Democratic administration and Republican officials whose constituents have lost their homes to Hurricane Helene or are recovering from Hurricane Milton.\nGovernors, mayors and members of Congress who are usually loath to break from the Republican nominee have been determined to push back on his claims.\nRepresentative Chuck Edwards, whose district includes most of storm-ravaged western North Carolina, issued a statement on Oct 8 to forcefully \u201cdispel the outrageous rumours that have been circulated online\u201d about the federal response.\nThe Republican congressman also reminded his constituents: \u201cNobody can control the weather.\u201d\nWashington-based Republican strategist Doug Heye, a North Carolina native, has been active in calling out disinformation about the recovery process in his home state.\nRepublican officials in affected regions are spending time fact-checking their party\u2019s presidential nominee instead of focusing on helping their constituents.\n\u201cThey and Fema have to take their eyes off the ball to deal with this and that is what is incredibly unhelpful for those who are impacted,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this stuff isn\u2019t helping get relief on the ground and help the people in need.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
