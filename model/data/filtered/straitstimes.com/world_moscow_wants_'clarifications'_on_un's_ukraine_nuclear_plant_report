I will not list them but we requested these clarifications from the IAEA Director General\", Mr Lavrov told Interfax.\nOn Tuesday, Russia's ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said Moscow \"regrets\" that the report did not blame Kyiv for shelling the plant, which Russian forces have occupied since March.\nMr Lavrov's spokesman on Wednesday blamed the West for putting \"pressure\" on the UN atomic agency.\n\"It is obvious that the West was always putting pressure (on the IAEA) and that it hasn't stopped,\" she was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency.\nLast week, a 14-strong team from the IAEA visited Zaporizhzhia, with the UN nuclear watchdog's chief Rafael Grossi saying the site had been damaged in fighting.\nAt least two members of the team were to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the facility's safety.\nThe head of Russia's state nuclear energy agency Rosatom, Dr Alexei Likhachev, said Wednesday that Moscow would \"do our best to ensure the safe operation of the plant exclusively in contact with the IAEA\".
