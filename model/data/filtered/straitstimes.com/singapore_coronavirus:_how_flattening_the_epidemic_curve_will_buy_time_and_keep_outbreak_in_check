Of these, 96 have been discharged.\nCurrently, all Covid-19 patients in Singapore are kept in hospitals for long periods to ensure they are free of the virus before being discharged.\nAvoiding infection is also key to ensuring healthcare systems can cope during the outbreak, and people can do their part by regularly washing their hands, maintaining personal hygiene by disposing of their own used tissue papers, and avoiding unnecessary physical contact such as shaking hands, say experts and public health authorities.\nWhat does the epidemic curve show?\nThe number of infections in a viral outbreak tends to follow a particular pattern over time, and this is the picture painted by the epidemic curve.\nWhat are the three phases?\nPhase 1: At this stage, infected patients are mostly imported, with people who have contracted the virus in one country travelling elsewhere, said microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles, an associate professor at the University of Auckland, in an opinion piece published on New Zealand news site The Spinoff.\nShe wrote: \"Think of Covid-19 as several fires blazing away, with embers shooting off in all directions. Our goal is to stop those embers from turning into another blazing fire. It's beginning to look like anyone who has travelled overseas recently should think of themselves as a potential ember and be on the lookout for symptoms.\"\nPhase 2: Community transmission begins as infected patients continue about their daily activities instead of staying isolated.\nThe rate of increase is important in this phase, and this is the part of the curve which public health officials are looking to flatten by keeping the number of cases reported each day as low as possible.\nAs Prof Wiles noted: \"The quicker and higher the numbers rise, the more likely the outbreak will overwhelm us, making it harder to control.\"\nPhase 3: The number of new cases starts to approach zero. This could be because a vaccine has been introduced or in the worst-case scenario, when everyone has been infected. A licensed Covid-19 vaccine will only be ready by the end of this year at the earliest, according to medical experts around the world.\nWhy is it important for the curve to be flattened?\nFlattening the curve will, in a way, help to buy time.\nNational Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs Singapore's multi-ministerial task force set up to combat the spread of Covid-19, had said at a press conference last week (March 6): \"Slowing down the spread and flattening the epidemic curve is very useful, because we avoid overwhelming our hospitals with a surge of cases, and we buy ourselves time - time that will be very useful because over the longer term, we may have better treatment, better anti-viral drugs and, eventually, a vaccine may be in place.\"\nIf the number of new cases goes up suddenly and dramatically, there will be a greater burden on hospitals and healthcare professionals in the area. Doctors will, for example, be placed in the unenviable position of deciding which patient gets a bed in the hospital, or who should be directed to the intensive care unit.\nWhen hospitals struggle to provide adequate care to each patient, this can increase the mortality rate.\nHospitals in Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - had faced a grim situation, with patients lying - and dying - on hospital floors for lack of beds, and health workers crumbling from exhaustion. In Lombardy, the worst-hit region in Italy, hospitals began to run out of beds in intensive care units as of March 9.\nAs Dr Philippe Devos, a Belgian emergency-medicine physician, said: \"Up to now, people have the impression that this disease poses an individual danger, when in fact the danger is for the population as a whole.\"\nHe told AFP: \"With very rare exceptions, young people are not dying, but when they clog up hospitals they are taking the place of others who will die without proper treatment.\"\nWhich phase is Singapore in?\nBased on Prof Wiles' classification of the phases of the outbreak, Singapore is in Phase 2, since community transmission has already occurred here.\nHowever, the number of new Covid-19 cases reported here every day is much smaller compared with the surge of hundreds to thousands of new cases in other countries.\nThis number has also remained very stable, with new cases in the last five days since March 7, for example, standing at eight, 12, nine, six and 12 respectively. This means Singapore's \"curve\" more resembles a straight line at this point.\nDr Ong Siew Hwa, a cell biologist, said Singapore's strict containment measures have helped flatten the curve somewhat, in that the healthcare system here did not become overwhelmed by the growing number of cases.\nHowever, she noted that it was too soon to say if Singapore has the outbreak under control.\nDr Ong, who is director and chief scientist of Acumen Research Laboratories, a home-grown company which has developed a diagnostic test kit for the virus, said epidemic curves are best plotted after an outbreak is over, since there are many factors affecting how the disease spreads.\nEven now, much is still unknown about the basic biology of the virus, such as the modes of transmission and whether patients could spread the virus even if they do not show any symptoms, she noted.\nAdded Dr Ong: \"Different countries, cities and territories all have different epidemic curves as this depends on local factors such as size of the area, population density, policies and availability of healthcare infrastructure, as well as the infected people being socially responsible.\"\nIn comparison, the number of confirmed infections in Italy between March 7 and March 11 increased by 6,579, an exponential jump from 2,600 new cases between March 2 and March 6.\nSingapore has aggressively sought to contain the virus through testing, contact tracing and quarantines.\nIt has put social-distancing measures in place, including suspending all social activities organised by government agencies for seniors for 14 days from Wednesday (March 11).\nNational Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday likened social distancing measures to \"circuit breakers\" where Singapore tries to \"stop the transmission chain and flatten the epidemic curve\".\nIndividuals too can also play a part.\nAs Professor Carl Bergstrom from the University of Washington said on Twitter: \"Through aggressive sanitation efforts, diligent hand-washing, cancelling large gatherings, minimising travel, teleworking, and similar measures we can flatten out the epidemic curve, keeping the number of people simultaneously infected at a low enough level to be manageable.\"\nWhat are other countries are doing to flatten the curve?\nChina: The epicentre of the outbreak, with over 80,000 cases and 3,000 deaths, has been under an extensive lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, including strict quarantine and travel restrictions for hundreds of millions of citizens and foreigners.\nThe lockdown has begun to ease slightly with the number of new cases in China falling dramatically. The country reported 15 new cases on Wednesday, down from 2,000 a day when the outbreak was at its peak last month.\nIran: Iran and Italy are currently the two worst-hit countries besides China by the coronavirus. Unlike China, however, the number of infections in both countries is still continuing to rise steadily daily.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani initially dismissed the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak, saying last month that it was no worse than other epidemics that Iran has suffered.\nHe also said that the country would only quarantine individuals and not cities or regions, a decision which has since been questioned by Iranian Parliament members who have called for infected areas to be quarantined and offices to be closed.\nIran reported 63 new deaths on Wednesday (March 11), its highest single-day total yet, as its number of infections reached 9,000.\nItaly: Italy appears to be approaching the top of its epidemic curve as China earlier this year, with 2,300 new cases diagnosed on Wednesday to bring its total to more than 12,400 cases, along with 827 deaths.\nIt followed in China's footsteps by implementing a country-wide lockdown on Tuesday, with all non-essential travel in the country banned, and schools and universities closed.\nThe restrictions, which also include the suspension of all sporting events, will run until April 3.\nHowever, it may still be some time before a decline in cases will be seen, going by China's experience.\nAfter the Wuhan and Hubei province-wide lockdowns were imposed on Jan 23 and 24 respectively, it was not until the middle of February that the rate of new cases in Hubei began to slow down noticeably."}
