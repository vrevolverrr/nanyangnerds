The winning team will be appointed to provide professional consultancy services for the node\u2019s development, for a fee of $570,000.\nAs for the former station in Tanjong Pagar, URA said it will \u201cassess the ideas from the competition and distil key concepts from the feedback, ideas and proposals gathered (for the station) over the years, and study their feasibility for implementation\u201d.\nOpened in 1932, the station was the southern terminus for the Keretapi Tanah Melayu railway line within Singapore that stretched from Kranji to Tanjong Pagar, and was gazetted a national monument in 2011 \u2013 the year that the line was decommissioned.\nTanjong Pagar station has been closed since 2016 for repair works, as well as the construction of an extension to the Circle Line, and will be repurposed for public use after 2028.\nWhile acknowledging that there is no guarantee that his ideas will be implemented, Mr Chiang said he hopes that any future use of the station will take on his proposal to have a variety of programmes and activities on offer so that \u201ceveryone can feel they have a stake in something\u201d when they visit.\nHis proposal considered five types of activities \u2013 community, arts and culture, culinary, health and wellness, as well as fitness.\nA basketball court and a volleyball court, for instance, can appeal to sports buffs, while the arts and culture programming, which he suggested could be sited in the main station building, would include a heritage gallery and a handicraft workshop.\nMr Chiang, 29, who works for a local architecture firm, said he was particularly excited by the prospect of making the station\u2019s two existing platforms more event-friendly.\nThe narrow platforms are currently separated by train tracks, making them unsuitable for larger-scale events.\nTo overcome this, he suggested that mobile platforms be installed between the two existing ones on the tracks."}
