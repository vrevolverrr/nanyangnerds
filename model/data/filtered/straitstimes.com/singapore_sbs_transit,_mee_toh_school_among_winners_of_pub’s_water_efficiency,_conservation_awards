{"title": "SBS Transit, Mee Toh School among winners of PUB\u2019s water efficiency, conservation awards", "tags": "singapore", "timestamp": "2024-03-26", "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 What do you do with wastewater from washing buses?\nFor SBS Transit, the answer was simple: Recycle it, by using underground tanks at the bus depots and separating the water from oil and sludge to make it clean so it can be used again to wash more buses.\nTo save even more water, new measures such as smaller spray nozzles, which also boosted water pressure for more efficient cleaning, were introduced.\nAdditional pumps were also installed at the Ulu Pandan and Seletar depots, where the underground tanks were, to transfer more recycled water for bus washing.\nThe new measures are part of a bus washing efficiency project by SBS Transit and are integrated into the SBS\u2019s Automatic Bus Washing Systems at the two depots.\nThe project has enabled SBS Transit to save up to 25 per cent of water per bus washed and helped earn the public transport operator the Water Efficiency Award (Projects) \u2013 an inaugural award by national water agency PUB to honour projects that have improved water efficiency and showed innovativeness in conserving water.\nRanging from manufacturing plants and data centres to commercial buildings and schools, a total of 42 organisations from the non-domestic sector were lauded this year across the three award categories.\nApart from the Water Efficiency Awards (projects), PUB also presented the Water Efficiency Awards and the Singapore Watermark Awards on March 26.\nSpeaking at the Flower Field Hall in Gardens by the Bay, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu underlined the need for the non-domestic sector to be more water-efficient.\nThis is all the more so, as the sector is projected to make up two-thirds of total water demand \u2013 an increase from the current half \u2013 by the year 2065, said Ms Fu at the awards ceremony.\n\u201cWhether you are a business owner, a consumer or environmental advocate, we all have a role to play in ensuring the sustainable use of water,\u201d she added.\nRecipients of the Singapore Watermark Awards, Singapore\u2019s highest honour for achievements in water conservation, included Mee Toh School, a primary school in Punggol, in recognition of its long-running water conservation initiatives from 2019 to 2022.\nAt the school, a group of student leaders known as \u201cenvironment champions\u201d organise projects for environmental causes and share information on water conservation during school assemblies. They also go on occasional trips outside of school to identify or learn about environmental problems and come up with innovative solutions.\nOne of these involved recycling.\nThis happened after a neighbourhood trip one day, when a team of primary four and five pupils observed that some of the bottles inside commingled recycling bins were contaminated and were unsuitable for recycling.\nTaking inspiration from school attendants who cleaned the floors using rainwater collected in the school\u2019s rainwater collection tanks, the pupils invented a device that utilises rainwater to clean recyclables.\nCalled Wishy-Washy, it uses a sensor and a micro:bit, a pocket-sized programmable computer, to detect the recyclables before activating sprinklers for rinsing.\nThe device is even up for an upgrading \u2013 Wishy-Washy 2.0 \u2013 after an operations manager of a waste management and recycling facility reviewed it and suggested that the recyclables could be dried at the end.\nSeparately, Mee Toh School\u2019s operations and support staff also conduct daily checks of the water meter readings in the school to detect underground water pipe leakages so that timely intervention can be taken to minimise water wastage.\nThese efforts paid off when the school successfully lowered its annual water consumption by 30 per cent between 2019 and 2022.\nLast year, it was announced that PUB would raise its funding for water recycling projects to a maximum of $5 million, up from $1 million.\nTo date, PUB has awarded close to 400 grants for water-efficiency projects, which collectively save 70 million litres of water each day, said Ms Fu."}
