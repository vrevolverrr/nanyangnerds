One Bill for Ukraine, a second with US$26 billion for Israel, a third with US$8.12 billion \u201cto counter communist China\u201d in the Indo-Pacific and a fourth that includes a potential ban on the social media app TikTok.\nThe Ukraine Bill also calls for the transfer of Army Tactical Missile Systems with a range of up to 300km, which Kyiv has pledged not to use inside Russia\u2019s territory.\nRussia has increased its long-range bombardment of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure and its cities in recent weeks, ratcheting up the pressure on Kyiv as Moscow\u2019s more numerous and better equipped forces slowly advance on the battlefield in the east.\nOnce the Ukraine Bill is signed, funds to replenish stocks would rebound, alleviating Pentagon concerns that the use of Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to aid Ukraine would compromise US military preparedness.\nTens of billions of dollars in the Bill was earmarked to buy replacements for weapons sent to Ukraine along with transportation and administrative overhead.\nThe Bill gives Mr Biden US$8 billion worth of further PDA. This added to the US$3.9 billion remaining from previously authorised PDA means Mr Biden can transfer US$11.9 billion worth of excess weapons from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency."}
