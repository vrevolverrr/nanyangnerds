{"title": "More tech, less physical labour at Star Living\u2019s new furniture warehouse", "tags": "business", "timestamp": "2023-10-24", "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Singapore furniture brand Star Living opened its new high-tech, seven-storey headquarters in Sungei Kadut on Tuesday.\nThe new building houses its corporate office, fully automated warehouse and furniture showrooms.\nSpanning 19,050 sq m, the warehouse makes use of the Internet of Things \u2013 a network that facilitates communication between the devices connected to it \u2013 to speed up and streamline operations, and increase operational efficiency and storage capacity by 50 per cent.\nThe company has a specialised warehouse management system, autonomous-guided vehicles and mobile shuttles.\nThe autonomous-guided vehicles use sensors to navigate and pick up heavy furniture throughout the facility, while the motorised mobile shuttles transport the items across the warehouse space.\nWith no need for human intervention, this enhances workers\u2019 safety and frees them up to do other things.\n\u201cManaging a furniture warehouse on such a large scale requires heavy manpower and labour,\u201d Ms Xu Xue Ting, group corporate and retail director of Star Living, said. \u201cMost of our workers end up doing mundane tasks, such as sorting, transporting and finding products.\u201d\nStar Living, which started in 1981, offers a variety of household products across seven brands under Star International, and handles the entire furniture life cycle from design to manufacturing, retailing and exporting.\nThe automated moving process should lead to a shorter customer wait from order to delivery.\nReducing the time taken for operations and redeploying employees to do other things is important given today\u2019s tight labour market, said Ms Low Yen Ling, who is the Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Culture, Community and Youth.\nMs Low, the guest of honour at the headquarters\u2019 opening, added that more companies in Singapore have increased efforts to use technology to increase productivity.\nBesides improving efficiency, it is also important for Singapore companies to expand into the international market, given the small domestic market here, said Ms Low.\nThe development of the warehouse was supported by Enterprise Singapore\u2019s Enterprise Development Grant, which supports projects that help companies upgrade, innovate and grow their businesses."}
