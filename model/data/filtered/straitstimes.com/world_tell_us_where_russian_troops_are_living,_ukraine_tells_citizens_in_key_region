Earlier that month the head of the region's penal service was taken to hospital after a bomb exploded near his car.\nThe intelligence directorate's appeal - published on Telegram - also asked for the routes that Russian military equipment was using in Enerhodar.\n\"Together, let's kick the occupants out of our homeland!\" it said, adding people could either call in details or provide them via the WhatsApp or Signal instant messaging apps."}
