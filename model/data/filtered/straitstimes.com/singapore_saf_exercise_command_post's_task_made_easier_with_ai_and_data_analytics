What we've shown is just a very small slice of what typical operations are,\" he said at a media preview earlier this month.\nReporters were given a demonstration of how the CCIS works at the preview at the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) Integrated Complex in Depot Road.\nThe primary interface of the CCIS is an electronic map of a battlefield that flashes an alert when a potential enemy is detected. The software can recommend options that can possibly eliminate it if the commander clicks on the target detected.\nThe map fuses information from multiple intelligence and surveillance assets, such as the Heron 1 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the Veloce 15 mini-UAV, which debuted at the exercise.\nMr Sim Jian Ping, head of capability development (military information) at DSTA's Information Programme Centre, said at the preview that the recommendation engine takes in three components of data.\nThe capabilities of aircraft and other assets is one aspect, in addition to environmental data such as the terrain at Mountain Home. Data on the exercise's scenario is also included.\nWhile various options can be presented by the CCIS, Lt-Col Lee said the commander still has to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making his choice, with the overall mission in mind.\nOther than proposing suitable strike options, the software is also able to plot flight plans for intelligence assets, such as the Heron 1 UAV, when new reconnaissance requirements appear.\nLt-Col Lee stressed that the system - which has been upgraded with each iteration of Exercise Forging Sabre - is a constant work in progress, with technology evolving quickly.\n\"The system is customisable, it's future-proof. Capabilities are just parameters in the system. To give an analogy, you can use a ride-hailing service, but it can be used to call a sedan, limousine or even a bus.\"\nMr Sim added: \"There's no real endgame; it's what we call continuous development.\""}
