Trading with others means adjusting industries and jobs, and key for Singapore is helping its people manage these changes, said Mr Chan.\nThe way to deal with rapid changes in technology is to invest in education and training so that people can reskill to seize new opportunities, while policies to provide equitable access to opportunities can mitigate the unequal distribution of economic growth, he added.\n\u201cThese tasks demand leadership with honesty, gumption and vision,\u201d he said.\nChoosing sides in a polarised world is unconstructive, Mr Chan added.\nWhile it takes much more effort to bridge differences and find new ways to cooperate, that is the only way forward that fosters peace and stability, he stressed.\nSingaporeans can do so by deepening their understanding of the global forces at play, and how they impact partner countries\u2019 motivations and actions in order to find space for feasible collaboration, he said.\nHe noted that Professor Liow\u2019s new book \u2013 Navigating Uncertainty: Our Region In An Age Of Flux \u2013 makes this point, reframing the question from who Singapore chooses to partner, to how to make others choose Singapore.\nHe urged people to avoid \u201cthe laziness of mind\u201d that reduces complex global issues to simplistic binaries, such as good versus evil, or democratic versus authoritarian. \u201cThese labels hinder our ability to find common ground.\u201d\nHe also stressed that historical interpretations of contemporary actions can illuminate, but may also end up confining countries\u2019 choices.\n\u201cWe are all familiar with the saying, \u2018Those who do not read history are bound to repeat it\u2019. Yet, at the same time, I must say those who are captured by history are also equally bound to repeat it \u2013 if we use old concepts, then we become prisoners of those ideas,\u201d he said."}
