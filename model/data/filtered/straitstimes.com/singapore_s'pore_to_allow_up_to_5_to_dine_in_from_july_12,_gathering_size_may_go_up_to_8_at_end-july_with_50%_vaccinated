At the current rate, the task force expects half of the population to have two doses of vaccines around the week of July 26, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who also co-chairs the task force.\nCurrently, about four in 10 of Singapore's population have been fully vaccinated, he added.\n\"Once we reach 50 per cent, it'll be timely for us to have a more definitive road map to transit towards living with endemic Covid-19,\" he said.\nMr Wong said the task force is mindful that there could be people who are not vaccinated as they may face adverse effects from the vaccine, or because they are not eligible for vaccinations, for instance children aged 12 and below.\nSome guidelines will be worked out to allow people in this group to be able to dine in groups of eight, for instance if they take a pre-event test, he added.\nChildren could be allowed to qualify, but up to a cap. This is because from a public health perspective, the risk of severe illness for children is much lower, he said.\nMr Wong said these plans are part of a broader road map being worked out by the multi-ministry task force that will cover both measures within Singapore and travel-related guidelines.\n\"We hope all of this will once again encourage everyone to take up the vaccination, or to bring forward your appointments and get vaccinated earlier,\" he added.\nThe minister said there is a good public health basis for differentiated measures to apply to vaccinated people.\n\"If you have been vaccinated, you get good protection against the infection and against severe illness and therefore, you don't need to have such strict measures applied to a vaccinated person or to groups of vaccinated persons.\"\nGuidelines still have to be worked out for those who remain unvaccinated or are ineligible for any of the mRNA vaccines, including children, he added.\nLast month, the multi-ministry task force announced that Singapore's vaccination programme will be ramped up, allowing it to set a new target of having two-thirds of its population fully vaccinated by National Day, on Aug 9.\nFollowing that, the country is expected to gradually transition to the new normal, where Covid-19 will be managed like other endemic diseases.\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged those who have not been vaccinated to sign up as soon as they can.\nHe said: \"Our vaccination programme is on track...Thanks to everyone's cooperation, we are a step closer to moving on from COVID-19. Let's keep working together!\"\nREAD NEXT: 9 things to know about Singapore's Covid-19 rules from July 12"}
