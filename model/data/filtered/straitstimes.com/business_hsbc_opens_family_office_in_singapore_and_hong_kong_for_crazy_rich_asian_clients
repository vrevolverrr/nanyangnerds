Like other banks, it has struggled with low interest rates over the past years and is seeking out more fee-based income to boost profitability.\n\"We are seeing greater interest from Asian clients who are setting up and expanding family offices, to adopt institutional approaches to build continuity, diversification and resilience in their investment portfolios,\" said Ms Siew Meng Tan, regional head of HSBC Private Banking, Asia-Pacific in the statement.\nIn the next decade, about US$1.9 trillion of wealth in Asia will be passed on to the next generation, HSBC said. Globally, HSBC Private Banking attracted US$13.1 billion of inflows in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion in the same period last year."}
