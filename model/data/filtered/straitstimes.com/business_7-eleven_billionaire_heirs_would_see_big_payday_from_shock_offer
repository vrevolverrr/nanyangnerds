That gives the company a market value of 5.63 trillion yen (S$50.3 billion).\nThe Japanese group\u2019s founder died in 2023 at the age of 98 with a net worth of US$5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His son Junro Ito is an executive vice-president and sits on the board.\nCouche-Tard founders Alain Bouchard and Jacques D\u2019Amours also built 10-figure fortunes from the convenience store business, with net worths of US$7.9 billion and US$3.9 billion respectively, according to Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index.\nThe company has grown from a single suburban Montreal location opened by Mr Bouchard in 1980 to more than 16,700 stores globally via a deal spree that has seen it snap up rivals, including US chain Circle K.\nActivist pressure\nThe late Mr Masatoshi Ito, who was born in 1924, expanded and transformed his small family-owned shop into one of Japan\u2019s largest retailers and took 7-Eleven convenience stores global.\nSometimes called the Sam Walton of Japan, Mr Masatoshi Ito was known for a decentralised business style that was influenced by his long friendship with famed management consultant Peter Drucker, who once described Mr Ito as \u201cone of the world\u2019s outstanding entrepreneurs and business builders\u201d.\nThe company\u2019s empire now spans 85,000 convenience stores, gas stations and retail outlets worldwide.\nMr Causton said it also plays an outsized role in Japan, offering essential services, including food and water delivery in times of calamities such as earthquakes.\n\u201cSeven & i is more than just a retailer; it is part of the backbone of Japanese emergency response services,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t see government being supportive of a foreign takeover in this case.\u201d\nUntil recently, the firm was forging takeovers of its own. In 2020, Seven & i agreed to buy about 3,900 Speedway gas stations and stores from US-based Marathon Petroleum for US$21 billion, at the time its biggest-ever deal.\nSeven & i has come under pressure from activist fund ValueAct Capital Management over perceptions that its assets could be worth more, and to narrow its focus to 7-Eleven stores.\nForeign takeovers of Japanese companies are extremely rare, but recent changes in guidelines for mergers, as well as activist investors pushing companies to boost value, could open the door to a deal that would create a global convenience-store behemoth.\nHeirs of Mr Masatoshi Ito own the majority of their Seven & i shares through an investment vehicle that does not disclose individual ownership. Mr Masatoshi Ito and his wife Nobuko had three children \u2013 Yasuhisa, Hisako and Junro. BLOOMBERG"}
