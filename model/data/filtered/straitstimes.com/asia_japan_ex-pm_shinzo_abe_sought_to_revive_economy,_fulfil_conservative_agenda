He resigned without presiding over the Games, which were postponed to 2021 due to Covid-19.\nHe first took office in 2006 as Japan's youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health.\n\"What worries me most now is that because of my resigning, the conservative ideals that the Abe administration raised will fade,\" Mr Abe subsequently wrote in the magazine Bungei Shunju.\n\"From now on, I want to sacrifice myself as one lawmaker to make true conservatism take root in Japan.\"\nFive years after resigning, which he blamed on the intestinal ailment ulcerative colitis, Abe led his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - ousted in 2009 - back to power.\nHe then launched a three-pronged \"Abenomics\" strategy to beat persistent deflation and revive economic growth with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending, along with structural reform to cope with a fast-aging, shrinking population.\nTough stance\nFirst elected to parliament in 1993 after his father's death, Mr Abe rose to national fame by adopting a tough stance toward unpredictable neighbour North Korea in a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang decades ago.\nThough Mr Abe also sought to improve ties with China and South Korea, where bitter wartime memories run deep, he riled both neighbours in 2013 by visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan's past militarism.\nIn later years, he refrained from visiting in person and instead sent ritual offerings.\nAcross the Pacific, Mr Abe forged close ties with US President Donald Trump, playing golf and engaging in frequent phone calls and meetings.\nHe was reelected as LDP president for a third consecutive three-year-term in 2018 after a party rule change and, until the Covid-19 pandemic struck, some in the LDP had considered another rule change to allow him a fourth term."}
