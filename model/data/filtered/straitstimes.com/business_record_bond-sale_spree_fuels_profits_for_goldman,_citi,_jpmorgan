That is because many companies moved up the timing of their issuance to seize on the current market conditions.\n\u201cWhile we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year,\u201d JPMorgan chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said during the bank\u2019s earnings call on Friday.\nIt remains to be seen whether the positive momentum in mergers and acquisitions will continue and the advisory business \u201cstill faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment\u201d, he added.\nWells Fargo chief financial officer Mike Santomassimo also attributed the high issuance volumes in the high-grade market to companies likely pulling issuance forward.\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Arnold Kakuda, that indicates that sales may fall in the second half of 2024.\n\u201cWith the potential for volatility to pick up with increased geopolitical risk, the corporate bond markets may not be as open as it is now,\u201d he said.\nGoldman\u2019s Mr Solomon, meanwhile, said he expects \u201csolid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year\u201d, given a more accommodative issuance backdrop and the potential for increased acquisition financing amid a pickup in mergers and acquisitions after 2023\u2019s slump.
