They told her that begging with them was futile because a superior had tasked them to \"resolve\" the issue of the dog.\nAfter several blows to the head, the dog limped out of frame but can be heard whimpering in the background before going silent.\nMs Fu said its limp body was put into a yellow plastic bag and taken away.\nBy Saturday, the post had been viewed more than 50 million times with over 118,000 shares, but it could not be searched on Weibo and was no longer available on Monday.\nDespite censors' best efforts at scrubbing the incident from the Internet, the case gained a second wind after local officials responded to the incident on Saturday.\nThe Xinzhou District Xishi Community virus control group said the staff involved had been removed from their positions and had apologised to Ms Fu, who \"expressed her understanding\" of the situation.\n\"Before workers at the scene sufficiently communicated with (Ms Fu), they conducted harmless disposal of the pet dog,\" the group said in a statement posted on its official social media accounts.\nThe use of the term \"harmless disposal\" sparked further outrage, with many holding it up as another instance of officials overreacting and overreaching in the pursuit of zero Covid-19.\n\"When did 'prevention and control' become a shield for people doing anything they want?\" wrote one Weibo user. \"While we sincerely thank front-line workers for their tireless work, we also express our utmost protest against those who illegally infringe on others' private property and slaughter animals.\""}
