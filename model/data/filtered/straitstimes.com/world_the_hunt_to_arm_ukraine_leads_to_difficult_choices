The Nato chief declared that support to Ukraine's fight against Russia would continue \"for as long as it takes.\"\nBut for all of the assurances, there remains a problem. Ukraine also needs more of the Russian-style weapons that its military is trained to use, and the available global supply of them is running low.\nTo find those weapons, the United States and other allies have been scouring the globe, looking for willing suppliers in a hunt that has revealed both the promise and pitfalls of unlocking stockpiles of Russian-standard and Soviet-style weapons for use by Ukraine.\nThere have been some successes. Finland, which has long balanced the sensitivities of its Russian neighbour, is sending Ukraine some Soviet-style weapons, including ammunition and guns compatible with the AK-47 assault rifle. South Korea is supplying ballistic vests, helmets, medical equipment and other defence assistance.\nCambodia, Congo, Rwanda, Mexico, Colombia and Peru have each received a recent visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a painstaking, behind-the-scenes diplomatic campaign to countries that have demonstrated support for Ukraine but are still reluctant to supply lethal aid.\nAnd then there is Cyprus. It has presented a special window on the difficulties of keeping up with the urgent demand for arms that Ukraine's troops are burning through faster than can be supplied as they claw back large swaths of territory and push the Russians to retreat.\nUntil this month, Cyprus had been under a US arms embargo for 35 years, imposed to help tamp down tensions after a conflict left the island bitterly divided between a government backed by Greece and a portion still controlled by Turkey - both Nato members.\nIn that time, Cyprus turned to the Soviet Union and then Russia for weapons and military equipment. Today its stockpile of at least 10 Tor and Buk missile systems that can down Russian aircraft, drones and cruise missiles could provide a bonanza for an embattled Ukrainian army.\nBut the Cypriot government has made clear it wants new and better replacements, something that could antagonise Turkey and reignite an arms race in the still unresolved conflict. Even so, on Oct 1, the Biden administration formally lifted the embargo, allowing Cyprus to buy American weapons.\nUS officials said the move was several years in the making and broadly intended to pull Cyprus away from Russian influence. But one US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the delicate diplomacy, said Cyprus was now \"a potential option\" as a supplier to Ukraine.\nCyprus \"would be ready to consider\" transferring some of its weapons and ammunition to Ukraine if they were \"replaced with other military apparatus of equal power and capabilities,\" Mr Marios Pelekanos, a government spokesperson, said in a statement to The New York Times.\nHe cited numerous meetings with US officials in recent months, during which \"we have also discussed this possibility.\"\nAlready, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has pledged to reinforce his troops in northern Cyprus with additional weapons as the US embargo is lifted.\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said Tuesday that \"we welcome additional contributions to provide Ukraine with the continued support it needs to defend itself\" but would not discuss diplomatic conversations with specific nations, including Cyprus.\nOn Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called on allies to speed air defense systems to his country as \"currently the No. 1 priority.\" Already, Nato nations have committed to sending Ukraine billions of dollars in sophisticated Western weapons - including about US$17 billion (S$24.50 billion) from the United States alone.\nRussia is responding by buying artillery from North Korea and, notably, military drones from Iran, which have blitzed southern Ukrainian cities and last week struck a town about 50 miles (80km) outside Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.\nDozens of countries have sought to remain neutral, including China and India, which are Russia's two largest weapons customers but which Monday renewed calls for de-escalation after Moscow's missile strikes.\nEastern European nations, many of which were once satellites of the Soviet Union but are now Nato members, have eagerly sent Russian-standard equipment to Ukraine since February: tanks and artillery munitions from the Czech Republic, howitzer guns from Estonia, helicopters from Latvia and Slovakia, and amphibious infantry combat vehicles and thousands of 122 mm-calibre Grad rockets from Poland.\nAs of Tuesday, the latest data available, Poland was the fourth-largest contributor of military aid to Ukraine, following the United States, Britain and the European Union, according to a database of public commitments compiled by the German-based Kiel Institute.\nBut Poland, like other Eastern European nations, cannot spare its remaining stockpile of Soviet-style weapons without risking its own defences and wants to see other countries step up, a Polish defence official said.\nTalks among allies to share parts, ammunition and other equipment, and to prod defence manufacturers to ramp up production are continuing, including this week at a high-level meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels. But weapons contracts can take months, if not years, to complete.\nMr Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, said Tuesday that the defence ministers would be asked to decide how best to quickly replenish member states' stockpiles while still providing Ukraine with a range of weapons - not just air defence systems, he said, but also more artillery, armoured tanks and ammunition.\n\"They need almost everything, and allies are providing unprecedented support,\" Mr Stoltenberg said in Brussels.
