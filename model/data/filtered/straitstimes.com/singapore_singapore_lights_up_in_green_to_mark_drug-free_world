The ribbon was first launched in the 1996 National Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign, organised under the banner of the National Council Against Drug Abuse.\nMembers of the public also participated in the DrugFreeSG Light-Up by festooning their windows with green fairy lights given out at the inaugural Drug Victims Remembrance Day roving exhibitions held between May and July.\nIn 2023, the number of drug abusers arrested in 2023 rose by 10 per cent to 3,122, from 2,826 in 2022. Of those arrested in 2023, 952 were new drug abusers, a 19 per cent increase from the 802 in 2022, according to updated figures from CNB.\nMore than half of the new abusers arrested were below the age of 30. Among them were six 14-year-olds, who were the youngest abusers to be arrested.\nMs Nur Azlinda Zulkifli, 37, a former offender who is now an anti-drug advocate for CNB, lit up her home with green fairy lights to commemorate the occasion.\n\u201cI felt that I should take this chance to remember all those who are affected by drug abuse, especially family members who became the victims,\u201d said Ms Azlinda.\nShe added: \u201cAlways consider the choice and think of the consequences of how it will affect your family and people around you. Drugs destroy your health and life, and prevention is better than cure.\u201d"}
