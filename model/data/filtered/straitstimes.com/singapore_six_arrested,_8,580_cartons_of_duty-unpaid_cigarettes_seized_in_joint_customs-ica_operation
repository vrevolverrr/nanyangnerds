The truck was also seized.\nThe total duty and goods and services tax (GST) evaded on the cartons amounted to about $732,730 and $58,780 respectively.\nCourt proceedings against the six men are ongoing, said Singapore Customs.\nUnder the Customs Act and the GST Act, it is an offence to buy, sell, convey, deliver, store, keep, have in possession or deal with duty-unpaid goods.\nOffenders can be fined up to 40 times the amount of duty and GST evaded and/or jailed for up to six years. Vehicles used in committing such offences may be forfeited.\nAnyone with information on smuggling activities or evasion of Customs duty or GST can call the Singapore Customs hotline on 1800-233-0000 or e-mail customs_intelligence@customs.gov.sg to report these illegal activities."}
