The US military and Japan say it is safe.\nIn August, a US Osprey crashed off the coast of northern Australia while transporting troops during a routine military exercise, killing three US Marines.\nAnother crash-landed in the ocean off Japan\u2019s southern island of Okinawa in December 2016, prompting a temporary US military grounding of the aircraft.
