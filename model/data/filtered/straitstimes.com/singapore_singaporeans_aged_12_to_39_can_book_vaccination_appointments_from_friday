That means about 44 per cent of the population has received at least their first jab, he said.\nNearly three-quarters of seniors above the age of 60 have received at least one dose of the vaccine or have booked an appointment for vaccination, said Mr Ong.\nThe figure for the age group of 45 to 59 is also 74 per cent. For the group aged 40 to 44, who started vaccination on May 19, the figure is 65 per cent.\nFor students, about 85 per cent of them have either received their first dose or booked their appointment, he added.\n\"We're now vaccinating about 49,000 doses on a daily basis, and we have the capacity to maintain this acceleration of our vaccine roll-out, provided our supplies are steady and continue to arrive,\" he added.\nThe health minister also gave an update on the effect of the vaccination on severity of illness should someone then catch Covid-19.\nOf all Covid-19 cases since April 11, 9 per cent of those who are unvaccinated developed serious disease, he said. This meant that they needed supplementary oxygen or be put in the intensive care unit."}
