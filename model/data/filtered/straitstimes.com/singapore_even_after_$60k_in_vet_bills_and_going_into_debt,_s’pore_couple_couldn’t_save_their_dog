We kept going to the vet to find out what was wrong and constantly switched from premium kibbles to a hypoallergenic diet from the clinic. We spent between $2,000 and $3,000 (on the vet visits and food), but his condition did not improve,\u201d Ms Cheng, an event organiser, told The Straits Times.\nWangcai was also given cytopoint, an antibody used to treat atopic dermatitis, a chronic condition he was diagnosed with which causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin, but his condition worsened.\n\u201cHe was scratching more and that led to some open sores and bleeding every day. He also developed hives, redness in his groin, \u2018armpit\u2019 area and between his toes, rashes on his belly, fur loss and scabs and dandruff-like flakes,\u201d Ms Cheng said.\n\u201cWe realised we were treating the symptoms, not going to the root of the skin issue. The medication was affecting his immune system, and realising what we had put our baby through, I cried,\u201d she added.\nAfter the vet said that Wangcai had to go back once every two weeks for the cytopoint injection, which cost around $400 each, and would be on antihistamine for the next six months, she and her event emcee husband felt that Wangcai had had enough medication.\nThey looked into changing his diet instead. After six months of trial and error, the couple settled on a diet that seemed to suit him.\nWhen Wangcai was around two years old, his health turned around \u2013 he stopped scratching incessantly and \u201cbecame a normal dog\u201d. And the couple was $10,000 poorer.\n\u201cWe went through 1\u00bd years of craziness. It was a steep learning curve providing care to Wangcai. That was when we started researching and learning as much as we could about pet health, lifestyles, supplementation, nutrition and many other factors that would impact our pets\u2019 quality of life,\u201d Ms Cheng said, adding that it was also why the couple went on to open a holistic pet store.\nWhen Wangcai grew older, other health issues surfaced \u2013 he was found to have an enlarged prostate and joint issues.\nAnimals like Wangcai that are sold by backyard breeders may cost less, but they often have birth or genetic defects and infectious diseases, according to experts.\nAnimal welfare groups and the authorities have warned against buying pets from these breeders, as pet ownership here hit an all-time high and more illegal breeders are selling animals through online platforms such as Facebook groups and Telegram.\nAccording to a Euromonitor International report, the pet dog population in Singapore was around 114,000 in 2023, up by almost 3 per cent from 2019. The pet cat population hovers around 94,000 in 2024, a jump of almost 10 per cent from 2019.\nTo deal with Wangcai\u2019s enlarged prostate, Mr See and Ms Cheng tried herbal remedies instead of neutering him. Four to six months later, the prostate did not shrink, but it was not giving Wangcai any urinary problems, either.\n\u201cTo understand his joint issues, we sent him for an X-ray but the issues did not show up on the film. That was when we turned to chiropractic and swimming sessions for his joint problems. They provided relief but did not fix the problem,\u201d Ms Cheng said.\nBy then, Singapore was in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown affected the entertainment industry. The couple were struggling financially but Wangcai\u2019s health issues did not dissipate.\n\u201cWe had just started our holistic pet store... and were trying to make ends meet. (So) we held back on dealing with Wangcai\u2019s health head-on. Till this day, I regret the decision,\u201d Ms Cheng said, her voice breaking.\n\u201cWe could not keep doing MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to monitor his joints. Each MRI cost $5,000 and we were strapped for cash,\u201d she said.\nA young, active dog, Wangcai loved to jump, dash and lunge. One day, the behaviour led to a tear in his cranial cruciate ligament (CCL), a common cause of hind limb lameness and pain.\nThe CCL tear spiralled into intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) \u2013 a common source of back pain in dogs. The condition is more common in French bulldogs and can cause excruciating pain, incontinence and paralysis in serious cases.\n\u201cIt happened overnight. He was walking funnily when we woke up in the morning. Jackie suspected it was IVDD and the only thing that could correct it was surgery,\u201d Ms Cheng said.\nAt the veterinary hospital they were referred to, Ms Cheng was told that the CT scan would cost $9,000 and the surgery alone $25,000.\n\u201cMy mind went blank. I took Wangcai home and started calling other animal hospitals to see if their charges were lower, much lower,\u201d Ms Cheng said.\nThat same night in December 2022, Wangcai\u2019s pain became unbearable and he was thrashing about and went into seizures, making the situation worse. Ms Cheng took him to another hospital. Unfortunately, the surgeon\u2019s schedule was full.\n\u201cI practically begged him before he agreed to free up his appointments to help. Then came the financial crisis. There was not enough credit on my cards to pay for the surgery and the surgeon would not start unless a deposit had been made. Fortunately, a friend had accompanied me there and she forked out the difference,\u201d she said.\nWangcai was discharged from the animal hospital after the surgery, relieved of pain but paralysed. Four days later, things went south and Wangcai was rushed back to the hospital.\n\u201cThe team managed to stabilise him, but I noticed he was having difficulty breathing. In front of me, he suffered a seizure, and I was immediately pushed out of the room before the nurses called \u2018code blue\u2019 (which means a patient has gone into cardiac or respiratory arrest). The vet and nurses tried to resuscitate him for two to three minutes but Wangcai died,\u201d Ms Cheng recalled.\n\u201cDid we kill him by wanting the best for him? He went through so much pain in his short four years of life,\u201d Ms Cheng said, sobbing from the memory.\nFor all the treatments, the couple emptied their savings. Not only that, they also sold their Housing Board flat in August 2023 to clear the credit card loans they took for Wangcai\u2019s medical bills.\nNot wanting to give up on Wangcai\u2019s memory, they used some of the proceeds from the sale of the flat to continue their holistic pet food business \u201cas part of Wangcai\u2019s legacy and hopefully to help the pet community using alternative solutions\u201d.\nThe tragic experience did not stop the couple from loving another dog.\nAfter a year of grieving, they adopted another French bulldog on Christmas 2023 \u2013 Bean Bean, a former breeding dog from animal welfare group Voices for Animals.\n\u201cHaving been through the experience with Wangcai, we believe we will be able to care for Bean Bean better,\u201d Ms Cheng said."}
