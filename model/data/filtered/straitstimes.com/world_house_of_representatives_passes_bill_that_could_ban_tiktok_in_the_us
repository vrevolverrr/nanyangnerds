Do we want the data from TikTok \u2013 children\u2019s data, adults\u2019 data \u2013 to be staying here in America or going to China?\u201d he said.\nIt is unclear if China would approve any sale or whether TikTok\u2019s US assets could be divested in six months.\nIf ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and others would not be able to legally offer TikTok or provide Web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications."}
