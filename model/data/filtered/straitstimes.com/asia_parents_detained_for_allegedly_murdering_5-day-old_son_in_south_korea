They also claimed that they had buried the body themselves, as they were financially strapped and could not afford cremation.\nThe couple said they feared that their parents would separate them if they were aware of the pregnancy.\nThe Goseong county government found out the couple had not registered the birth of the infant and reported the child\u2019s disappearance to the police last Thursday.\nThe police dispatched around 80 staff, including riot police, to search the area around the mountain the father had named, but were unable to find the corpse.\nDuring further investigation, the father confessed he had strangled the baby and that he had tried to bury the body in the wilderness, but had to change the location due to a number of passers-by.\nPolice are focusing their investigation on finding the infant\u2019s corpse around the location the couple said they had dumped the body, with cooperation from the coast guard.
