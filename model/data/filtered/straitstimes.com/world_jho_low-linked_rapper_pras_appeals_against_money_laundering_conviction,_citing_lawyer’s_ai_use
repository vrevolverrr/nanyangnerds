He made frivolous arguments, misunderstood the law and evidence, and ignored weaknesses in the prosecution\u2019s case, Michel\u2019s attorneys argued in a court filing in October.\n\u201cThe AI program failed Kenner, and Kenner failed Michel,\u201d the rapper\u2019s new attorney Peter Zeidenberg wrote in a filing in Washington federal court.\nThe case comes as lawyers have predicted AI will transform the legal profession by helping to analyse contracts, perform legal research and communicate with clients. The company that created the program Mr Kenner used, EyeLevel.AI, touted it after the verdict as the first use of generative AI in a federal trial.\n\u201cThe system turned hours or days of legal work into seconds,\u201d Mr Kenner said in a release on the company\u2019s website.\nMr Kenner did not respond to several requests for comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has set a Dec 28 hearing to consider evidence in Michel\u2019s motion.\nMichel\u2019s request to void his verdict pointed to factual mistakes in Mr Kenner\u2019s closing argument, along with errors in legal judgment. In speaking to jurors, Mr Kenner misattributed a Puff Daddy song to the Fugees, the hip hop group that made Michel famous in the 1990s. He also said Ghetto Superstar was a Fugees song when it was Michel\u2019s hit.\nJurors convicted Michel of all 10 counts, including conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act; conspiring to act as an unregistered foreign agent of China and to commit money laundering; acting as an unregistered agent of Low; acting as an agent of China in seeking the removal of billionaire Guo Wengui; and conspiring to funnel Low\u2019s money into the campaign of president Barack Obama in 2012.\nMichel argues that Mr Kenner did not make \u201cthe strongest and most obvious argument\u201d on the Chinese agent count \u2013 prosecutors produced no evidence that he acted at the \u201cdirection or control\u201d of China, a key legal element of the charge.\nIn seeking a new trial, Michel claims Mr Kenner provided ineffective assistance of counsel and had two conflicts of interest that affected his performance.\nOne was that Mr Kenner and another lawyer on the case had a financial stake in EyeLevel.AI, elevating their interest in the AI program over a competent defence. EyeLevel co-founder Neil Katz said that claim is simply untrue.\n\u201cNeither David Kenner nor his associates have any secret financial interest in EyeLevel,\u201d Mr Katz said. \u201cThat is just something that was made up.\u201d\nThe other conflict that Michel claims involves prosecutors seeking a contempt charge a month before trial against Mr Kenner for allegedly leaking grand jury material to Bloomberg News. After the trial started, Judge Kollar-Kotelly assigned the contempt proceeding to another judge, who has set a hearing for Nov 13.\nMichel\u2019s lawyers argue Mr Kenner may have gone easier on witnesses because he feared the wrath of prosecutors. During the trial, Mr Kenner said he believed the prosecutors \u201cput the sword of Damocles over me\u201d to control his cross-examinations, Michel\u2019s lawyer wrote.\nEarly in the trial, Judge Kollar-Kotelly held a hearing to discuss the possible conflict with Michel, the filing shows. She said \u201cthere\u2019s an appearance that your attorney could want to please the government\u201d to get prosecutors to abandon the contempt motion. She asked if he understood the conflict.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand,\u201d Michel said. \u201cAll I know is that I\u2019m totally pleased with my attorney.\u201d\nMichel\u2019s lawyers also cited errors in rulings by the judge and impermissible testimony that hurt him at trial.\nMr Katz said his Denver-based company, which has about 10 employees, helps companies and law firms build \u201ctruthful AI with their private data\u201d.\nAt the Michel trial, it did so \u201cbased strictly on the facts of the case as presented in court\u201d, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not bringing in ideas on the open Web.\u201d\nThe technology, which relied on transcripts from the trial, wrote a first draft of the closing argument, Mr Katz said.\n\u201cIt was absolutely not used in the final draft,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps you say what you want to say.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
