Interested private healthcare operators can register their interest at go.gov.sg/ptehospconsult\nMOH data shows that demand for hospital beds here remains high, with the daily occupancy rate at public hospitals ranging between 72.5 per cent and 100 per cent in the last week of December.\nAs at 2022, Singapore had 19 acute hospitals \u2013 which focus on treatment and surgery \u2013 of which 10 are public and nine private.\nMount Alvernia Hospital is currently Singapore\u2019s only private not-for-profit acute hospital. Its annual surplus goes towards developing and upgrading the hospital, supporting the Assisi Hospice as well as its community outreach activities.\nPublic health specialist Jeremy Lim noted that Mount Alvernia Hospital has been successful in not only bringing additional capacity into the healthcare system, but also introducing elements such as pastoral care into healthcare.\nThe 62-year-old hospital would be a useful reference point for new initiatives, said Associate Professor Lim, author of the 2013 book Myth Or Magic: The Singapore Healthcare System.\nHe added that a new hospital operating under such a system could provide a springboard to launch novel business models.\nHowever, the terms provided by MOH for the new model could be challenging for private healthcare operators, said Prof Lim.\nLarger not-for-profit providers here could step forward to operate an acute hospital, he suggested.\nBeyond an increase in hospital bed capacity, the implications for patients will depend on factors such as the financing of such a model and the nature of the operator, he added.\nNoting that the state focus on factors such as cost-efficiency suggests MOH is \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the potential pitfalls associated with such a model, Prof Lim said the ministry will have to design, implement and monitor the programme very carefully.\n\u201cMount Alvernia wanting to operate a second not-for-profit hospital would be very different from Raffles Medical trying to set up a not-for-profit model within a for-profit entity.\u201d"}
