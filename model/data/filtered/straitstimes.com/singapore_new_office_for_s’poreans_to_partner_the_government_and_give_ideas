We will also support more ground-up efforts by Singaporeans to shape and improve their communities.\u201d\nThe Government will actively seek input and work closely with all stakeholders and partners, said the report prepared by the fourth-generation political leaders led by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong.\nBesides creating more avenues for civic participation and ground-up efforts, the report also sketched out ways to nurture a stronger culture of giving and for people to support their fellow Singaporeans.\nThe recommendations follow the 16-month-long Forward Singapore exercise that saw more than 200,000 Singaporeans contribute their suggestions.\nAt a press conference on Friday, Mr Wong said: \u201cThis is more than just an engagement exercise. It\u2019s really a partnership effort... between Government, people, community groups, employers, businesses, (it) encompasses our tripartite partnership.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a whole-of-Singapore partnership, and that\u2019s the only way that we can implement these big moves and these big shifts together.\u201d\nUltimately, the aim is to build a vibrant, thriving and resilient society where the broad middle enjoys progress, the vulnerable receive care, and the better-off do their part to improve the lives of fellow citizens, said the report.\n\u201cWe ask that Singaporeans step forward to give back to our society, especially those who have done well and benefited from the system,\u201d it added.\nThis could be through financial donations, contributing knowledge, or working with community organisations.\nTo this end, a new programme will be introduced to better connect donors to local communities and channel donations to where they are needed over a sustained period.\nThis will be done in collaboration with the Community Foundation of Singapore and Community Chest.\nFor example, a donor could support the educational needs of children from several lower-income families not just financially, but also in the areas of mentorship, internship and job opportunities, to help build their social capital and networks.\nBusinesses can also do more for the wider community, said the report.\nIt held up business leaders-turned-philanthropists such as Hajjah Fatimah, who donated land to build the Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, Govindasamy Pillai who set up the Ramakrishna Mission charity, and Tan Tock Seng, who donated money towards the building of what became Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\nTo guide companies in designing business practices and operations that can benefit society, the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre has set up the new Company of Good strategy, and 55 companies have adopted this corporate purpose framework.\nYoung people can give their views on policies through youth panels that were launched in May. These panels will look into financial security, careers and lifelong learning, digital well-being, and environment and sustainability.\nMr Wong said some of the top issues for youth that surfaced during the Forward SG exercise were jobs and career choices, mental wellness and sustainability.\n\u201cThere was a very strong sense of wanting to give back and support others who are less fortunate,\u201d he said, adding that a group of young people worked closely with the Ministry of Social and Family Development team to come up with recommendations to uplift lower-income families.\nAnother aspect of fostering unity involves strengthening multiracialism and the Singaporean identity, said the report, adding that the Government will do its part by continuing to expand spaces for more interactions between different groups.\nMore will be done to promote collaborations between the various self-help groups, and to encourage more Singaporeans to be involved in racial harmony programmes in the community, said the report.\nIt noted that sustained effort to sensitively manage the difficult issues on race and to create shared experiences through school, and community and national events, has allowed Singapore to enjoy several decades of racial and religious harmony.\n\u201cBut we must have the humility to acknowledge that our multiracialism is still a work in progress,\u201d it said.\nEven as more avenues will be provided for people to contribute ideas, the report said, not all ideas can be accepted and, sometimes, there may be differing views on how to achieve an outcome.\nIn such cases, the Government will explain its considerations, and take the \u201cpractical and pragmatic\u201d approach by looking at data and evidence and considering the circumstances and context before deciding on a way forward.\n\u201cSuch differences are not so fundamental because our ends are the same, and it is a matter of working out the best approach to take,\u201d said the report.\nFrom Friday to Sunday, Singaporeans will be able to learn more about the initiatives in the report at the Forward Singapore Festival at Silver Garden \u2013 Silver Leaf at Gardens by the Bay. After this, the festival roadshow will make its way to various heartland locations until Jan 28, 2024.\nThere will be exhibition booths on the key policy shifts highlighted in the report, an interactive booth where people can create their own avatars to discover what the shared future holds, and a holographic booth where they can make pledges for Singapore.\nRead the full report here."}
