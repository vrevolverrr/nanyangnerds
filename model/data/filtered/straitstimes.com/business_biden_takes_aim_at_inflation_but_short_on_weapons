But the US leader's approval ratings are barely in the 40 per cent range as people pay more at the petrol pump and in the grocery store.\nPetrol prices on Wednesday jumped to a national average of US$4.67 a gallon, from US$4.19 a month ago and just US$3.04 in June 2021, according to the American Automobile Association.\nThe Biden administration has released oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to try to bring down petrol prices, but with little effect.\nOther steps include clean energy tax credits and federal investments in production, as well as expanding Medicare to lower medical costs.\nOn Monday, Mr Biden unveiled the Housing Supply Action Plan, which aims to improve housing supply and affordability.\nBut many of the contemplated steps \"either require Congress to pass legislation (good luck with that) or they are policies that will not do a lot to bring down inflation in the near term\", said Stony Brook University economics professor Stephanie Kelton in a blog post.\nMr Biden on Wednesday acknowledged that his power to have an immediate impact is limited.\n\"The idea that we are going to be able to click a switch\" to lower prices is \"unrealistic\", he said.\n\"We can't take immediate action\" on petrol prices, he said, but instead can try to \"compensate\" to lower costs of other goods.\nAs the US economy roared back to life following the pandemic downturn, policymakers cheered but they were caught off-guard by the inflation surge.\nMr Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last year repeatedly assured Americans that rising prices would be \"transitory\", but have since admitted they misjudged.\n\"I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,\" Dr Yellen told CNN. \"There have been unanticipated and large shocks that have boosted energy and food prices, and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly.\"\nThe Fed has begun acting aggressively to try to cool the US economy, raising the benchmark lending rate three-quarters of a percentage point since March and signalling more big increases are coming in the effort to tamp down prices, hopefully without tipping the economy into recession.\nMoving earlier would have helped slow the economy faster, Mr Daco said, though at the cost of rapid growth.\nBut Ms Kathy Bostjancic, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the chances of a recession are low.\n\"We view a soft landing as the more likely outcome in 2023,\" she said.\nThe US economy still has potential for an increase in both labour and goods as workers return to the labour force and supply chains are restored, she said.\nUS consumers are also shifting spending more to services like travel and entertainment, which will take the pressure off goods.\n\"An increase in the supply side of the economy would go a long way to quell inflationary pressures,\" Ms Bostjancic said. That would allow the Fed to slow rate hikes, which \"could sharply improve the chances of achieving a soft landing for the economy\"."}
