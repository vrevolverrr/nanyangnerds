Inspecting the van, they found brown carton boxes labelled \"dried noodles\" with duty-unpaid cigarettes inside.\nThe man was arrested on the spot.\nInvestigations by Singapore Customs revealed that the man was engaged by another man, who is currently unidentified, to deliver duty-unpaid cigarettes to buyers using the van.\nThe duty and goods and services tax (GST) evaded on the 2,300 cartons amounted to about $196,420 and $15,900 respectively. The van was also seized.\nCourt proceedings against the man are ongoing, added Singapore Customs.\nBuying, selling and otherwise dealing with or possessing duty-unpaid goods can entail fines of up to 40 times the amount of duty and GST evaded, and/or jailed for up to six years for convicted offenders. Vehicles used in connection to these offences can also be seized."}
