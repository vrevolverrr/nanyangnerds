The term loans dated 2017 all have a five-year tenor and were outstanding as of March 8.\nThe latest lawsuit from Nanyang Commercial Bank followed a separate demand by UOB in March seeking payment of loan principal and unpaid interest, plus default interest, totalling HK$848 million. Mr Chen, his wife and his son had made a similar personal guarantee for that loan. The loan was due and payable as of March 21.\nPlagued by what he has called \u201cshort-term liquidity issues\u201d at Cheung Kei, which acquires and operates real estate assets globally, Mr Chen has lost at least US$1.4 billion worth of properties to creditors, both in Hong Kong and London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Among these properties, creditors have put up for sale an US$892 million office tower in Hong Kong\u2019s Hung Hom area and two buildings in London\u2019s Canary Wharf.\nCheung Kei did not respond to a Bloomberg e-mail requesting comment and phone calls to the company\u2019s Hong Kong office went unanswered on April 22.\nRepresentatives of Nanyang Commercial Bank and UOB did not respond to Bloomberg\u2019s e-mail inquiries.\nAn ongoing downturn in office markets worldwide has weighed further on properties previously owned by Cheung Kei. Sales plans for 5 Churchill Place, one of the group\u2019s investments in Canary Wharf, have been shelved as interest rates remain high and vacancy rates shoot up.\nThe defendants have 14 days from the date of the writ to either satisfy the banks\u2019 claims or to indicate to the court whether they will contest the proceedings or make an admission, according to the court filing.
