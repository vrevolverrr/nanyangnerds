Our thoughts go to the families,\u201d EU Council President Charles Michel said in a statement on X (formally known as Twitter).\nLater, Josep Borrell published a statement on X saying the EU \u201coffers its condolences\u201d after \u201cthe tragic helicopter crash on Sunday.\u201d\nThe messages provoked outrage from politicians and elected representatives on social media.\nSwedish MEP David Lega asked Borrell on X: \u201cCan you look the brave women and freedom fighters of Iran in the eye ever again? Can you look Floderus\u2019 or Djalali\u2019s families in the eye ever again? I can. Shame on you.\u201d\nIn 2017, Swede Ahmadreza Djalali was sentenced to death in Iran on espionage charges \u2013 which his family say are utterly false.\nIn April 2022, Iran arrested Johan Floderus, a Swede working for the EU\u2019s diplomatic service, as he was returning from a trip to Iran with friends.\nHe faces the death penalty on spying charges.\nBelgium\u2019s former migration minister Theo Francken denounced the \u201cEuropean condolences for the death of a butcher and cruel mass murderer.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cYou don\u2019t speak in my name.\u201d\nThe day before, the EU had activated its satellite mapping system to help Iran locate the helicopter.\nJanez Lenarcic, the EU Commissioner for Crisis Management announced on X on Sunday that the system had been activated and received criticism from other European politicians.\nMarie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a member of the German Free Democratic Party said: \u201cWhat a mockery of the brave fighters for human rights in Iran. I expect an explanation for this.\u201d\nLenarcic said May 20 that the act was \u201csimply an expression of the most basic humanity.\u201d\nThe ultraconservative Raisi had been in office since 2021, during a time that has seen Iran rocked by mass protests, an economic crisis deepened by US sanctions, and armed exchanges with arch-enemy Israel.
