This thin 'report' is actually evidence that no hard proof exists against MBS,\" Mr Shihabi said on Twitter.\nMr Abdulrahman al-Rashed, a Saudi columnist who runs a government-controlled media group said \"... and it is stated in the report: It is not certain that the accused team was on a journey to get rid of Khashoggi.\"\nHe too said there was \"no smoking gun.\"\nSaudi Arabia's biggest newspapers and television channels did not cover the release of the report, instead showing sports events and other unrelated programming. In its evening bulletin, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya referred to it briefly, focusing on what it said was the absence of concrete evidence.\n\"The nation is fortified,\" wrote the conservative and semi-official Okaz newspaper on the front page of its weekend edition, with a large picture of the crown prince smiling.\n\"The Biden administration will soon realise that the complex issues of the region will not find a solution, except through a new and exceptional agreement with its partners in the region that includes holding Teheran accountable,\" Okaz said."}
