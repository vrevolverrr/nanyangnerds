But at one point, I think we were as low as eight,\u201d Ms Lund told the NTSB.\nIn July, Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for US$4.7 billion (S$6.2 billion) in stock.\nThe hearings are reviewing key issues, including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\nFuselage defects\nMr Jonathan Arnold, aviation safety inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing\u2019s factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\u201cThat seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\u201d Mr Arnold said.\nMs Lund said before the Jan 5 accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing had defects \u2013 but the key is making sure they are manageable.\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,\u201d Ms Lund said. \u201cWe were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues, I will tell you, right around the time of the accident.\u201d"}
