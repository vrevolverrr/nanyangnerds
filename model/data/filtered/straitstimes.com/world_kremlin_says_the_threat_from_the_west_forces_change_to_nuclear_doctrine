Both are modernising their nuclear arsenals while China is rapidly boosting its nuclear arsenal.\nThe war in Ukraine has triggered the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, with both sides saying they cannot afford to lose the conflict.\nUKRAINE WAR\nAs Russia, which now controls 18% of Ukraine, advances, Kyiv has repeatedly asked for more Western weapons and permission to use Western-supplied long-range weapons in its attacks far into the Russian territory.\nThe U.S. is close to an agreement to give Ukraine long-range cruise missiles that could reach deep into Russia, but Kyiv would need to wait several months as the U.S. works through technical issues ahead of any shipment, U.S. officials said.\nSending Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) to Ukraine could significantly alter the strategic landscape of the war by putting more of Russia in range of powerful, precision-guided munitions, an important concern of the Biden administration, the officials said.\nPeskov said it was obvious that Ukraine would move to striking targets deep in Russia with Western weapons.\nRussia's foreign ministry said if Russia was struck with long-range weapons, the response would be immediate and \"extremely painful\".\n\"They are losing their sense of reality, they absolutely do not think about the risks of further dangerous escalation of the conflict, even in the context of their own interests,\" Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said.\n\"We would like to warn such irresponsible politicians in the EU, NATO, and overseas - in case of appropriate aggressive steps by the Kyiv regime, Russia's response will follow immediately.\" REUTERS"}
