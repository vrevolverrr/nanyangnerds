We have to be ready to anticipate and to get used to these kinds of acts of China, which are patently illegal, as we have repeatedly said,\u201d Mr Teodoro told reporters.\nIn the incident at Sabina shoal, Manila\u2019s South China Sea task force accused Chinese vessels of ramming and firing water canon at a Philippine fisheries vessel transporting food, fuel and medicine for Filipino fishermen.\nThe Chinese coast guard said the Philippine vessel \u201cignored repeated serious warnings and deliberately approached and rammed\u201d China\u2019s law enforcement boat, resulting in a collision.\nOn Aug 26, another incident transpired around the same shoal.\nChina\u2019s coast guard said it took \u201ccontrol measures\u201d against two Philippine Coast Guard vessels that \u201cillegally intruded\u201d into waters around Sabina and then approached its vessels in a \u201cdangerous manner and incited hype\u201d.\nOfficials from the Philippine Coast Guard and South China Sea task force did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the latest run-in. Aug 26 is a public holiday in the Philippines.\nAsked if the latest incident would trigger treaty obligations between the US and the Philippines, Mr Teodoro said: \u201cThat is putting the cart before the horse. Let us deter an armed attack, that is the more important thing.\u201d\nThe Philippines and the US have a mutual defence treaty, and Washington has vowed to aid the Philippines against armed attacks on its vessels and soldiers in the South China Sea.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nChina claims sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea, including areas claimed by the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brunei."}
