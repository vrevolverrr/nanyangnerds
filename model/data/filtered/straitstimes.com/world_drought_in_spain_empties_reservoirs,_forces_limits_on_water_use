Now a long drought has nearly emptied it.\n\u201cWe have never seen (it) so low,\u201d the 79-year-old local resident told Reuters at the reservoir, which is only 20 per cent full.\nPeople sunbathed on the reservoir\u2019s newly exposed shore, where a few specks of grass have cropped up. Some visitors tried to paddle-surf.\nCatalonia\u2019s authorities last week imposed new water usage restrictions on 22 villages around the reservoir, near the French border, as the aquifer supplying them is also emptying.\nSpain registered the driest start to a year in the first four months of 2023 since records began in the 1960s, with Catalonia and southern Spain\u2019s Andalusia being the most affected.\nSeveral heatwaves recorded in Spain and wider Europe this summer have worsened the drought, lowering reservoirs\u2019 levels as water evaporation and consumption increased, said Mr Ruben del Campo, spokesman for Spain\u2019s meteorological agency AEMET.\nThe 22 villages, plus two others in southern Catalonia, which account for around 25,000 residents in total, are in a state of water emergency.\nThis means they must lower their consumption to a daily average of 200 litres of water per resident from a prior cap of 230.\nThe authorities are not limiting water for human consumption yet, but watering for agricultural purposes will be largely banned, and water use for industrial and recreational purposes has to drop by 25 per cent.\nThe village of Agullana with 900 residents has been keeping its water usage below the 200-litre cap for several months, but its mayor said further steps will be implemented.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll reduce to zero the irrigation of gardens, the football field, the grass by the swimming pool, which we\u2019ll see turning yellow as if burnt,\u201d Mr Josep Jovell said. No water will be used to clean the streets, only dry sweeping, he added. REUTERS"}
