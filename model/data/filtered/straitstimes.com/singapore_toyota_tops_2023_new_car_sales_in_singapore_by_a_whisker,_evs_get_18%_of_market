They accounted for 18.1 per cent of the 30,225 new cars put on the road in 2023, up from 11.7 per cent in 2022.\nAmong EVs, BYD was by far the leader, with 1,416 units sold, followed by Tesla (941), BMW (789), Hyundai (694) and Mercedes (537). The Chinese brand was in fact a newcomer in the overall bestsellers\u2019 list, emerging fourth in sales with only three models \u2013 all electric.\nAnd among the bestsellers, BYD had the biggest increase in market share of 2.2 percentage points, while brands like Toyota, Mercedes and BMW posted dips in market share.\nToyota picked up speed in the second half, with the July-to-December period accounting for 60 per cent of its new car sales. At least 30 per cent of its sales are to fleet operators.\nMr Ng Khee Siong, managing director of Inchcape Singapore, to which Borneo Motors belongs, said: \u201cWe are very proud to be the market leader of 2023 and to regain our position as the top-selling car brand in Singapore.\u201d\nToyota\u2019s best-selling models were petrol-electric hybrids, including the Corolla Cross, which was launched in January 2023.\n\u201cThe popularity of hybrid vehicles will increase even further in 2024,\u201d said Mr Ng, adding that the company will expand the range of hybrid models, as well as its range of electric cars, which have so far been limited to the Lexus stable.\nMercedes-Benz Singapore president Claudius Steinhoff said: \u201cWe are delighted that Mercedes-Benz remains as Singapore\u2019s best-selling luxury car brand in 2023. We thank consumers for their steadfast interest in Mercedes-Benz through the years.\u201d\nHe added that 2024 would be a \u201cmomentous year\u201d as the brand concentrates \u201con the top-end segment\u201d.\nMr Anthony Teo, managing director of BYD distributor Vantage Automotive, said: \u201cWe are indeed thankful for the strong support and great product offerings from BYD and the close collaboration with our dealers to reach out to more customers with our extensive network islandwide.\u201d\nVantage Automotive has around half a dozen BYD dealers in Singapore.\nTesla was the other electric-only brand to make it to the top 10 list, although its ranking fell from sixth in 2022 to ninth in 2023.\nMeanwhile, parallel imports had a 21.2 per cent share of the new car market in 2023, versus 20.6 per cent in 2022.\nThe brand with the highest proportion of sales from parallel imports was Honda, with 74 per cent of total sales being parallel imports.\nOther brands with a high percentage of sales from parallel imports include Rolls-Royce (60 per cent), Suzuki (40 per cent) and Toyota (25 per cent).\nVeteran parallel importer Neo Nam Heng said the outlook for Japanese models looks bleak in 2024. \u201cThere is a shortage of supply in Japan. There is a one-year wait for models like the Toyota Noah and Voxy, and much longer for something like the Toyota Vellfire.\u201d\nThe chairman of diversified motor group Prime, which also sells parallel-imported Toyota and Honda cars, said: \u201cI hear that manufacturers are giving priority to overseas markets and that is why the domestic supply in Japan is smaller. Plus the pent-up demand after Covid-19 \u2013 there are not enough cars now.\u201d\nBut Mr Neo added that there is no supply issue for German cars."}
