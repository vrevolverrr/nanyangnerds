He also admitted to a molestation charge.\nSeven other charges were considered during sentencing.\nThe teenager started his crime spree when he targeted his classmate some time between October and December 2019.\nOn March 10, 2020, she went to Woodlands East Neighbourhood Police Centre and told officers that the offender had asked her for additional explicit pictures of herself.\nAccording to the girl, the offender would \"do something\" to the ones she had earlier given him if she did not give in to his demands.\nIt was not stated in court documents what happened next.\nHowever, investigators later managed to get hold of his mobile phone and found on the device a video of another girl, then 15, performing a sexual act on him.\nInvestigations revealed that some time between January and March 2020, this second victim was on social media app Instagram when she received a message from the offender on the platform. They started chatting and she told him her age.\nDespite this, he invited her to his home and asked her to perform a sexual act on him.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Lim Ying Min said that the second victim, who was initially reluctant to do so, gave in due to his persistence.\nThe offender then used his mobile phone to record her committing the act.\nBefore leaving his home, the girl asked him to delete the clip and he replied that he would do so later.\nSubsequently, he messaged the girl but she told him to stop doing so. The two teenagers then stopped contacting each other.\nAccording to court documents, the offender targeted his third victim, another 14-year-old girl, in February 2020, and sexually penetrated her.\nOn June 9 that year, he responded to an Instagram story of his fourth victim, who was then 13 years old, and they agreed to meet.\nThe next day, the pair and two other friends met at a staircase landing of a block of flats in Jurong East.\nThe offender then molested the fourth victim when she was alone with him after the two friends had left.\nHe later asked if they could be \"friends with benefits\" - a colloquial term for a friend with whom one has occasional sexual encounters.\nShe turned him down and alerted the police on June 16, 2020.\nOn Dec 13, 2020, the offender met his fifth victim via Instagram and they started chatting on messaging platform Telegram, where she told him that she was 15 years old.\nThe two teenagers met each other for the first time for lunch in Ang Mo Kio three days later and he told her that he needed to go home to \"collect his work stuff\".\nHe asked her to follow him home and they took a bus there.\nHe sneaked the fifth victim into his room without his mother, who was home at the time, noticing.\nThe offender then had unprotected sex with the girl. The pair left the flat soon after.\nIn the weeks that followed, the girl messaged him on Telegram but he did not respond to her.\nOn Feb 22 last year, she told her school counsellor that she felt disappointed and frustrated with the youth.\nThe counsellor told the girl's mother what had happened and the police were alerted the next day.\nSeparately, the offender was involved in two fights.\nThe first fight took place at the void deck of Block 855 Woodlands Street 83 on Oct 16, 2020 after a drinking session.\nThe second one took place in Woodlands Ring Road after another drinking session while he was out on bail on Oct 25 last year.\nFor each count of sexually penetrating a minor, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."}
