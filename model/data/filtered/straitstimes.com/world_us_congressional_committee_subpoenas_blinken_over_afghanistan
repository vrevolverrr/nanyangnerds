He also said State has provided the committee with nearly 20,000 pages of department records, multiple high-level briefings and transcribed interviews.\nMcCaul asked Blinken in May to appear at a hearing in September on the committee's report on its investigation of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nIn his letter to Blinken, the Republican committee chairman said current and former State Department officials confirmed that Blinken was \"the final decisionmaker\" on the withdrawal and evacuation.\n\"You are therefore in a position to inform the Committee\u2019s consideration of potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal, including potential reforms to the Department\u2019s legislative authorization,\u201d McCaul wrote.\nThe subpoena from McCaul's committee, which has been investigating the deadly and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan for years, comes as events surrounding the pullback become an increasingly politicized issue ahead of the Nov. 5 elections.\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, visited Arlington National Cemetery late last month and took part in a wreath-laying ceremony honoring the 13 servicemembers killed during the U.S. withdrawal.\nHe also visited Section 60 of the cemetery, where troops are buried and which is considered hallowed ground in the military.\nFederal law and Pentagon policies do not allow political activities in that section of the cemetery, but videos were taken by Trump's campaign and used in advertisements.\nDuring a speech in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump said families of service members who died in Afghanistan had asked him to go to the cemetery.
