No electricity, no food, no water, no gas \u2013 it\u2019s all closed,\u201d Mr Gallant said in a video message. The Gaza Strip is an exclave that is part of the Palestinian Territories and home to 2.3 million people.\nLast Saturday, Hamas militants from Gaza stormed the border with southern Israel, shooting people in the communities and towns nearby before Israeli security forces began fighting back.\nAt least 700 people were killed and dozens were taken hostage.\nThe death toll includes an estimated 250 people who were killed at a music festival attended by young Israelis and foreigners near Kibbutz Reim, close to Gaza, according to an organisation that helped to recover the bodies.\nIt was the deadliest such incursion since Egypt\u2019s and Syria\u2019s attacks in the Yom Kippur War years ago, and has threatened to ignite another conflagration in the never-ending conflict.\nIn the Gaza Strip, the death toll rose to at least 560, according to the Health Ministry, after the Israeli military launched air strikes on the exclave in response to the Hamas attack. These include 20 children, in keeping with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s vow of \u201cmighty vengeance\u201d.\nOn Monday, Mr Netanyahu said Israel\u2019s response to the attack will \u201cchange the Middle East\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Israel\u2019s chief military spokesman, Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari, said 300,000 reservists have been called up by the military since Saturday. The number suggests preparations for a possible invasion, though any such plans have not been officially confirmed.\n\u201cWe have never drafted so many reservists on such a scale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going on the offensive.\u201d\nPalestinians reported receiving calls and mobile phone audio messages from Israeli security officers telling them to leave areas mainly in the northern and eastern territories of Gaza, and warning that the army would operate there.\nSince Saturday\u2019s surprise assault, Israeli aircraft have been pounding Gaza targets while its ground forces have battled to retake control of border villages and towns overrun by Palestinian gunmen.\nRear-Adm Hagari said control of those communities had been re-established but that isolated clashes continued as some gunmen remained active. \u201cWe are now carrying out searches in all of the communities and clearing the area,\u201d he said in a televised briefing.\nMilitary officials had previously said their focus was on securing Israel\u2019s side of the border before carrying out any major escalation of the counter-offensive in Gaza.\nLieutenant-Colonel Richard Hecht, also a military spokesman, said earlier on Monday that fighting was ongoing in seven or eight locations near Gaza.\nHamas fighters also continued to cross into Israel from Gaza, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s taking more time than we expected to get things back into a defensive, security posture,\u201d he told journalists.\nFighter jets, helicopters and artillery struck more than 500 Hamas and militant group Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza overnight, including command centres and the home of senior Hamas official Ruhi Mashtaa, who allegedly helped direct the infiltration into Israel.\n\u201cOur job is to make sure that at the end of this war, Hamas will no longer have any military capabilities to threaten Israeli civilians with, and in addition to that, we also need to make sure Hamas will not govern the Gaza Strip,\u201d said another Israeli military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus.\nBeyond blockaded Gaza, Israeli forces and Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia exchanged artillery and rocket fire. In Egypt, two Israeli tourists were shot dead along with a guide on Sunday.\nHamas says its attack on Saturday was justified by the plight of Gaza under a 16-year blockade and the deadliest Israeli crackdown for years in the occupied West Bank.\nMainstream Palestinian groups who deplored the attacks said violence was predictable with a peace process frozen for nearly a decade and far-right Israeli leaders talking of annexing Palestinian land once and for all.\nIsrael and Western countries said nothing justified the intentional mass killing of civilians.\nIran, Hezbollah and protesters in some Middle Eastern nations lauded Hamas.\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry denounced what it called a \u201cbarbarous campaign of death and destruction\u201d by Israel.\n\u201cAs an occupying power, Israel has no right or justification to target the defenceless civilian population in Gaza or elsewhere in Palestine,\u201d it said on Sunday.\nAppeals for restraint have meanwhile come from around the world.\nEgypt, which has mediated between Israel and Hamas at times of conflict in the past, was in close contact with the two sides, trying to prevent further escalation, according to Egyptian security sources.\nQatari mediators have also held urgent calls with Hamas officials to try to negotiate freedom for the Israeli hostages seized by the militant group in exchange for the release of 36 Palestinian women and children from Israel\u2019s prisons, a source told Reuters.\nThe negotiations, which Qatar has been conducting in coordination with the United States since Saturday night, are \u201cmoving positively\u201d, said the source, who has been briefed on the talks.\nBut there are no signs of breakthroughs as both sides dig in.\nHouse-to-house terror\nHamas gunmen were reported to have gone house to house, gunning down civilians or abducting them back into Gaza, as panicked residents hid in their homes or died fighting back.\nAmong the hostages taken back into Gaza were children and a Holocaust survivor in a wheelchair, Israeli officials have said.\n\u201cThe cruel reality is that Hamas took hostages as an insurance policy against Israeli retaliatory action, particularly a massive ground attack and to trade for Palestinian prisoners,\u201d said Dr Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nUp to 250 bodies were strewn across the site of the music festival in a Negev desert kibbutz, mostly young people, while other revellers were feared to be among the hostages abducted into Gaza.\n\u201cThey butchered people in cold blood in an inconceivable way,\u201d said Mr Moti Bukjin, a spokesman for the Zaka volunteer group that helped to collect the bodies.\nIsrael\u2019s military, which faces awkward questions for not thwarting the attack, said it has regained control of most infiltration points along security barriers, killed hundreds of attackers and taken dozens more prisoner.\nIt said it has deployed tens of thousands of soldiers around Gaza, and was starting to evacuate Israelis around the frontier.\nUnabated violence\nUS President Joe Biden spoke to Mr Netanyahu for the second straight day, saying in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that he expressed his \u201cfull support for the people of Israel in the face of an unprecedented and appalling assault by Hamas terrorists\u201d.\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said he had ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean as a show of support to Israel, and would also begin providing fresh munitions to Washington\u2019s closest Middle East ally.\nIn Gaza, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem condemned the US announcement as \u201can actual participation in the aggression against our people\u201d and said the group would not be intimidated.\nThe escalation follows surging violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a Palestinian authority exercises limited self-rule, opposed by Hamas that wants Israel destroyed.\nConditions in the West Bank have worsened under Mr Netanyahu\u2019s hard-right government, with more Israeli raids and assaults by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages, and the Palestinian Authority called for an emergency Arab League meeting.\nPeacemaking has been stalled for years, with Israeli politics distracted in 2023 by internal wrangling over Mr Netanyahu\u2019s plans to overhaul the judiciary.\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the assault would spread to the West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\u201cHow many times have we warned you that the Palestinian people have been living in refugee camps for 75 years, and you refuse to recognise the rights of our people?\u201d he said."}
