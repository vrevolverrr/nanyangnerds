So much so that some believe it is these middle powers which will be the architects of the new world order, even though their increasingly proactive diplomacy is for now largely uncoordinated.\nMiddle powers, by no means a new or a uniform concept, are broadly understood as countries that are neither \u201cmajor\u201d nor \u201csmall\u201d, and which are well integrated into the global economy."}
