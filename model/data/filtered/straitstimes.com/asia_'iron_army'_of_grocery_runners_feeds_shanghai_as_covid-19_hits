Whatever artillery fire we face, we react quickly,\" said Dr Zhang Yangyang, manager of the bustling yet tidy Dingdong sorting depot.\nSince its initial outbreak faded two years ago, China has largely kept the virus under control through a tough zero-Covid-19 strategy.\nAlthough its national daily case numbers of a few thousand is unremarkable globally, it represents the country's worst uptick in infections since the start of the pandemic.\nWith the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreading, the authorities have imposed stay-at-home orders or other restrictions in several cities.\nBut unclear messaging about their plans has sowed public confusion, helping to fuel binge-buying and the resulting burden on business managers like Zhang.\n\"I don't have a weekend,\" Dr Zhang said."}
