The situation is becoming a matter of concern for us,\u201d said Mr Bhanwar Singh Bhati, the Minister of State for Power in the northern state of Rajasthan, where power supplies are already being rationed to homes and farmers.\n\u201cThe electricity demand may rise 20 per cent to 30 per cent compared with last summer. There is no other option than to cut power supply,\u201d he said.\nRajasthan is among India\u2019s hottest states and a hub of solar energy, yet it can struggle to ensure adequate power supply during summer months if there are delays receiving coal from mines in other regions.\nCoal accounts for more than 70 per cent of electricity generation in India, and stockpiles at power stations are currently well below the target of 45 million tonnes that the government asked to be met by the end of March.\nTo be sure, current elevated temperatures are not necessarily a signal of extreme weather in the period from March to May, according to Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general of meteorology at IMD.\n\u201cIt is natural to be excited if you get temperatures like this in the month of February,\u201d he said.\nIndia\u2019s ability to meet its summer power needs will also be largely determined by efforts to ensure that sufficient coal is being mined and transported, said Mr Pratap Keshari Deb, Energy Minister of Odisha, one of the nation\u2019s top producers of the fuel.\nIf coal supplies are ensured, \u201ceverything falls in place\u201d, he said.
