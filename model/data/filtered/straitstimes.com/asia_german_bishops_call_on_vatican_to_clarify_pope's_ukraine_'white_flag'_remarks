It would be good if the Holy See communicated a substantive clarification of its position on these issues,\" German bishops said.\nIn the interview Francis was asked for his position on a debate between those who say Ukraine should give up, as it has not been able to repel Russian forces, and those who say doing so would legitimise actions by the strongest party. The interviewer used the term \"white flag\" in the question.\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Saturday the pope had picked up on the term \"white flag\" and used it \"to indicate a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations\".\nGerman bishops said it was \"unfortunate\" that Francis repeated the words \"white flag\", but also said it was \"self-evident and widely proven to us that the Pope \u2013 like the German Bishops' Conference \u2013 is committed to a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\" REUTERS"}
