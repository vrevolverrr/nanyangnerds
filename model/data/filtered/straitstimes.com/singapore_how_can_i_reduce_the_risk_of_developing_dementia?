There is no cure, though treatments are available to manage the symptoms and slow down its progression.\nThe third updated report of the Lancet Commission on Dementia identified two new risk factors that, if addressed, could prevent dementia.\nAuthored by 27 experts, the new report said that an estimated 7 per cent of cases can be attributed to high levels of low-density lipoprotein, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, from around the age of 40.\nHigh levels of cholesterol in the brain are linked to an increased risk of stroke, and can also cause two proteins \u2013 amyloid and tau \u2013 which are linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to build up.\nBecoming more physically active and staying away from processed food high in saturated fats, as well as avoiding smoking and alcohol, are ways in which cholesterol levels can be managed.\nEven light physical activity can help reduce the risk, according to a study of more than 62,000 seniors in South Korea whose results were published in medical journal Jama Network Open in 2021.\nMeanwhile, 2 per cent of cases are attributed to untreated vision loss later in life, according to the report.\nThe number could be even higher, with research results published in Jama Ophthalmology in September suggesting that up to 19 per cent of cases in the elderly could be due to vision impairment.\nWhile the link between the two has not yet been established, it could be linked to diabetes \u2013 a risk factor for dementia that can also cause vision problems \u2013 or shared pathways in the brain that cause both vision loss and a decline in memory.\nCorrecting vision loss \u2013 via methods such as the use of spectacles or cataract surgery \u2013 could help reduce this risk.\nThese two factors are in addition to 12 others identified in earlier iterations of the report: lower levels of education, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury, air pollution and social isolation.\nThe report said that both government and individuals can play a role in reducing dementia risks, suggesting measures such as reducing exposure to air pollution through strict clean air policies, expanding measures to reduce smoking, and reducing the level of sugar and salt in food sold in shops and restaurants.\nThe findings from the Lancet Commission on Dementia were presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference held in Philadelphia in the US in July by Professor Gill Livingston from University College London, who led the research.\n\u201cHealthy lifestyles that involve regular exercise, not smoking, cognitive activity in midlife \u2013 including outside formal education \u2013 and avoiding excess alcohol can not only lower dementia risk, but may also push back dementia onset,\u201d she told British newspaper The Guardian."}
