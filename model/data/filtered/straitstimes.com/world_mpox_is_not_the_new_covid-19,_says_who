The alarm was lifted in May 2023.\n\u201cMpox is not the new Covid,\u201d Dr Kluge insisted.\n\u201cWe know how to control mpox and, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether,\u201d he said during a media briefing in Geneva via a video-link.\n\u201cTwo years ago, we controlled mpox in Europe, thanks to the direct engagement with the most affected communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put in place robust surveillance. We thoroughly investigated new cases contacts, and we provided sound public health advice.\u201d\n\u201cBehaviour change, non-discriminatory public health action, and mpox vaccination contributed to controlling the outbreak.\u201d said Dr Kluge\nHe said the risk to the general population was low.\n\u201cAre we going to go in lockdown in the WHO European region? Is it another Covid-19? The answer is clearly, \u2018No\u2019,\u201d he said.\nDr Kluge said the predominant route of transmission remained close skin-to-skin contact.\nBut he said it was possible that someone in the acute phase of mpox infection, especially with blisters in the mouth, may transmit the virus to close contacts by droplets, in circumstances such as in the home or in hospitals.\n\u201cThe modes of transmission are still a bit unclear. More research is required,\u201d he said.\nWHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the WHO was not recommending the use of masks.\n\u201cWe are not recommending mass vaccination. We are recommending to use vaccines in outbreak settings for the groups who are most at risk,\u201d he added.\nThe WHO declared an international health emergency on Aug 14, concerned by the rise in cases of Clade 1b in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its spread to nearby countries.\nA case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa.\nMpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as the Covid-19 one, there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.
