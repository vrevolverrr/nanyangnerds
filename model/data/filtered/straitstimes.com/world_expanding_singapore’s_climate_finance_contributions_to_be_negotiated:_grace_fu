This can come from public or private institutions.\nAt the COP27 climate conference, developed countries have been calling for an increasing donor base for climate finance, specifically looking at high-income countries that are still classified as developing countries, such as Singapore, South Korea and Qatar.\nA report by the Overseas Development Institute released in 2022 identified countries that have high per capita income and high cumulative emissions, which make them increasingly qualified to pay for climate finance. This puts countries including Singapore and Qatar on the radar.\nMs Fu told reporters at a COP27 update on Sunday the 2015 Paris Agreement states that all countries have a common responsibility to address climate change, but their responsibility differs according to their emissions, financial position and historical contributions to global warming.\nShe noted that Singapore already provides financial support via the South-east Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility for Asean member states in climate and disaster risk financing.\nAnother way for Singapore to contribute would be to buy carbon credits from countries with renewable resources and which have the potential to facilitate such a trade.\nAbout 5 per cent of the sale of carbon credits \u2013 as stipulated in the Paris Agreement \u2013 will go towards adaptation funding, she noted.\n\u201cSo, in a way, we are contributing already, but whether it\u2019ll be as an Annex 1 (developed) country, we have to consider in the greater context what it means for our status (as a developing country),\u201d she added.\nMs Fu also gave an update on discussions on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on carbon markets, which she is co-facilitating with her counterpart, Norway\u2019s Climate and Environment Minister Espen Barth Eide.\nWhile Article 6 negotiations have come to a close, and will provide more clarity to countries that want to participate in carbon markets, a few sticking points remain, such as the issue of confidentiality.\nUnder the Article 6 text agreed at COP27, countries are allowed to keep confidential the information submitted for reporting to the United Nations, though this will be subject to third-party review.\nObservers and experts fear this could undermine the integrity and transparency of carbon markets."}
