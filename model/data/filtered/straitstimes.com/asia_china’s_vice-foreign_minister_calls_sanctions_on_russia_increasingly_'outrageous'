Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system... and worsen the global economy.\"\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.\nIn a call on Friday between Mr Joe Biden and Mr Xi Jinping, the US president warned his Chinese counterpart of \"consequences\" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's attack, the White House said.\nMoscow has demanded legally binding guarantees from Nato that it will stop its expansion and return to its 1997 borders.\n\"This pursuit of absolute security (by Nato) precisely leads to absolute non-security,\" Mr Le said. \"The consequences of forcing a major power, especially a nuclear power, into a corner are even more unimaginable.\"\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said this week that Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join Nato."}
