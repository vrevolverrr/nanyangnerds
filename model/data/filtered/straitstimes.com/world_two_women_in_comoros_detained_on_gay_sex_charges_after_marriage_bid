If convicted, the two women who are aged 22 and 25 could be jailed for up to two years, he added.\nIt was not immediately possible to reach a lawyer representing the women.\nThere has been a growing crackdown on same-sex relations in some African countries in recent years, with tough anti-LGBTQ+ laws passed in Uganda and Ghana drawing strong condemnation from Western countries and rights campaigners.\nThe Ugandan law enacted last year includes life imprisonment for gay sex and the death penalty for certain same-sex acts.\nA report by the UK-based Human Dignity Trust, a rights group, said there were few known examples of anti-LGBTQ+ laws being enforced in the Comoros in recent years.
