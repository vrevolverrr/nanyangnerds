He has exhausted all legal avenues of appeal and can only be released from prison by a royal pardon from Malaysia\u2019s King.\nHe faces another three ongoing criminal cases. He is accused of illicitly receiving US$681 million (S$910 million) of 1MDB funds via British Virgin Islands shell company Tanore Finance, laundering RM27 million belonging to SRC International, and committing breach of trust involving RM6.6 billion in government funds paid to Abu Dhabi\u2019s government-owned International Petroleum Investment Company.\nMs Arinah also noted that the Pardons Board, a six-member team headed by the King, would have to consider carefully whether Najib\u2019s release is advisable so soon after he was convicted.\n\u201cThe country\u2019s reputation may be affected if they decide to pardon him as it can impact how Malaysia is perceived by other countries\u2019 leaders and investors,\u201d she told ST.\nNajib\u2019s bid to be released from prison was in the news last week, after Singapore\u2019s CNA reported a Pardons Board meeting was slated to take place in the third week of January. On Jan 10, Najib\u2019s lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah responded to the article saying his team and Najib \u201care in the dark\u201d about the status of the pardon petition.\nAnalysts say Najib\u2019s release would have political repercussions as he is still seen as influential among Malay voters and could help regain their support for his party Umno, which is also a partner in the unity government led by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n\u201cThere is a slim chance that this could factor in the Pardons Board\u2019s decision,\u201d said Mr Halmie Azrie Abdul Halim, a senior analyst at government regulatory affairs and political risk consultancy Vriens and Partners.\nST has learnt from a highly-placed source that the Prisons Department has submitted its report on Najib\u2019s pardon to the Prime Minister\u2019s Department\u2019s Legal Affairs Division (BHEUU), which will then present it to the Pardons Board.\nSuch a report usually includes statements on the prisoner\u2019s work, conduct, mental and physical condition and effect of imprisonment on his health.\nHowever, ST was unable to confirm when the report was sent to the BHEUU, nor when the Pardons Board meeting will take place.\nBHEUU declined to comment on ST\u2019s queries.\n\u201cThere is no time limit for when the report can be submitted, but a reasonable amount of time has to pass, generally three years, before a prisoner\u2019s conduct is reviewed,\u201d said senior constitutional lawyer Rajan Navaratnam.\nThe Pardons Board, headed by the King, consists of the Attorney-General or his representative, the Federal Territories Minister, and not more than three other members appointed by the King.\nThe King has the power granted by the federal constitution to grant a pardon to convicts.\nSpeculation on the Pardons Board meeting comes just weeks before the current King, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, steps down from the throne on Jan 31 after a five-year term. He is the ruler of Pahang, Najib\u2019s home state.\nThe ruler of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, will then ascend the throne.\nAccording to Datuk Seri Rajan, while the Prisons Department is at liberty to present its views in the report on the prisoner\u2019s conduct, the King has the final say on the pardon.\n\u201cThe pardon is at the sole discretion of the King, who will then decide on whether to pardon Najib, or cut short part of the jail term or grant an early release,\u201d he told ST.\n\u201cEven though the Federal Constitution requires the Pardons Board to give its advice to the King, His Majesty is not bound to act on the advice given by the Board and has the absolute discretion whether to grant a pardon,\u201d said Mr Rajan.\nNajib\u2019s lawyers applied for a royal pardon from the King in September 2022, on the basis that he did not receive a fair trial. In December 2023, they requested an update from BHEUU about the application, but no response has been received, said Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article has been edited for accuracy."}
