Nadarajah at a press conference on Jan 19, Bernama reported.\nConstruction of the escalator and a new multipurpose hall will begin after Thaipusam, which falls on Jan 25.\nWhile the hall is estimated to cost around RM35 million (S$9.9 million), Mr Nadarajah did not say how much the escalator will cost.\n\u201cWe hope the government would assist us since this will allow the disabled and elderly who are unable to climb the steps to reach the main temple,\u201d he said.\nBatu Caves in Gombak is home to one of the more popular shrines outside India and is dedicated to the Hindu god of war Murugan. A 42.7m-tall statue of the deity greets visitors at the entrance of the attraction.\nThousands of tourists and Hindu devotees visit the cave and temple every day, with numbers rising to an estimated 1.6 million over the four-day Thaipusam period in 2023.\nThe 272 steps leading to the limestone caves were the subject of viral photos on social media after they were painted in bright shades of blue, red and orange in 2018."}
