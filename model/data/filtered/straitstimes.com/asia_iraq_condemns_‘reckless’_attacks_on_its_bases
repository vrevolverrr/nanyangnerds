Eight unfired rockets were dismantled, the Iraqi statement said.\n\u201cThe formations in our security forces, through intelligence and security work, have obtained important information about the perpetrators of this attack against Ain al-Asad, and they are currently being pursued to bring them to justice,\u201d the statement added, without giving more details.\nA rare ally of both the US and Iran, Iraq hosts 2,500 US troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces.\nIt has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October.
