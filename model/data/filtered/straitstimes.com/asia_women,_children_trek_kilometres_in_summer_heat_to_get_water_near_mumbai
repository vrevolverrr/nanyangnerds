We are left with nothing,\u201d said Mr Ashok Shinde, whose village is home to about 700 people rearing poultry and livestock.\n\u201cThe government encourages us to breed animals, but what will we give them to drink if we don\u2019t have any water to drink ourselves?\u201c\nThe Vaitarna dam, which supplies water to Mumbai, is just 50km from Telamwadi, but is not linked to it.\nIndia ranks among the world\u2019s most water-stressed nations, the World Bank says, with just 4 per cent of global water resources, despite being the world\u2019s most populous, accounting for 18 per cent of global population.\nThe authorities in India\u2019s richest state of Maharashtra, home to both the village and Mumbai, say they expect to finish work by next summer on an alternative source of supply for Telamwadi.\n\u201cUntil the permanent solution is in place, we are providing water tankers to ensure residents do not face issues,\u201d state water supply officials told Reuters.\nWater for Telamwadi and nearby settlements will eventually come from a dam on another river, the Bori, the officials added, adding that water would flow to the area naturally as the dam was located at a higher altitude.\nUntil then, residents will have to depend on daily tanker supplies arranged by the government in summer, when the well, about 2km away, dries up completely.\n\u201cWe use a strainer to make sure no solid waste goes in,\u201d said one of the villagers, Mr Suman Bhutambare.\nBut when the implements sometimes fall in, someone must clamber in and descend a harrowing 4m to 6m to retrieve them.\nOne of the women usually makes the precarious journey, relying on numerous cracks in the walls to provide support.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very risky, as there\u2019s a chance of slipping and falling,\u201d Mr Bhutambare added.
