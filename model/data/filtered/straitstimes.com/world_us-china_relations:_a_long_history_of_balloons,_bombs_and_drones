No details or exact date were provided.\nChina\u2019s military pilots around that time were said to have been acting more aggressively in the region in various interactions with Australian and Canadian aircraft.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an alarming increase in the number of unsafe aerial intercepts and confrontations at sea by PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) aircraft and vessels,\u201d US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin at the time.\n2022: US Warship warned - again\nIn January 2022, Chinese forces tracked and warned the USS Benfold when it entered waters Beijing claims near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. The warship had \u201cillegally entered\u201d Chinese waters in a \u201cprovocative action\u201d, the Chinese military said.\nThe US Navy said its mission was in accordance with international law and in line with its commitment to defend \u201cevery nation\u2019s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows\u201d.\nThe Benfold made repeated forays into waters claimed by China during 2022, including sailing through the Taiwan Strait at least three times in July.\n2021: US warship warned\nIn May 2021, Beijing said the USS Curtis Wilbur illegally entered its territorial waters near the Paracel Islands. The US denied it had.\n\u201cUS behaviour violates international law and basic norms of international relations, and increases regional security risks,\u201d the PLA said in a statement.\nNavy officials denied the guided-missile destroyer had been \u201cexpelled\u201d by China.\nThe Curtis Wilbur \u201casserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law,\u201d the 7th Fleet said in a statement.\n2018: Warships almost collide\nThe guided missile destroyer USS Decatur in September 2018 got perilously close to its Chinese counterpart in contested waters \u2013 near reefs in the South China Sea occupied by China but also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines.\nThe US Navy said in a statement that the two ships came within 41m, or what amounts to seconds away from a collision.\nThe Chinese vessel \u201cconducted a series of increasingly aggressive maneuvers accompanied by warnings for the Decatur to depart the area\u201d, the US Navy said.\n2016: US Drone captured\nChina in December 2016 scooped up an underwater US drone in international waters, in plain sight of the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey ship.\nThe unmanned underwater vehicle, which the Pentagon said was operating lawfully, was allegedly collecting data about water conditions \u2013 including salinity and temperature \u2013 about 50 nautical miles north-west of Subic Bay, off the Philippines.\nThe drone was returned following a formal protest by Washington. At the time the provocation was seen as a challenge to the incoming Donald Trump administration.\n2001: Hainan Island\nAn international dispute followed the mid-air collision of a US Navy EP-3E intelligence aircraft with a Chinese J-811 fighter jet about 110km from the Chinese island of Hainan in April 2001.\nThe Chinese jet was lost in the skirmish with its pilot missing and presumed dead. The much larger US plane made an unauthorised emergency landing on Hainan after its crew destroyed sensitive items. The 24 US airmen were detained for 11 days; Washington reimbursed Beijing for their care and feeding.\nIt fell to US President George W. Bush to craft a response to Beijing that expressed regret but did not admit to wrongdoing.\n1999: US bombs Chinese embassy\nTensions flared in May 1999 when the US struck China\u2019s embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, with five guided bombs, killing three people. According to the US at the time, the intended target was a nearby Yugoslav military facility. Beijing called the bombing a \u201cbarbarian act and a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty\u201d.\nPresident Bill Clinton apologised to Beijing for what he called an accident. Central Intelligence Agency director George Tenet later told Congress that his agency had identified the wrong coordinates. The actual motive for the strike remains in dispute. BLOOMBERG"}
