Or regale them with the story of Sustain-erella instead of Cinderella.\nThese are two of the four familiar fairy tales retold with an environmental twist in the Once Upon A Green World children\u2019s book series.\nThe other titles are The Little Mermaid Saves Our Seas, inspired by The Little Mermaid; and Three Little Sheep Build A Better Future, fashioned after The Three Little Pigs.\nSarah Ang, 43, who wrote Three Little Sheep, says: \u201cI love the storyline of Three Little Pigs, of them not listening to advice and paying the consequence of their houses being destroyed. It\u2019s such a well-loved moral tale with a lot of famous lines to play with.\u201d\nHer story sees the sheep building eco-friendly homes in their effort to fight climate change.\nShe adds: \u201cI hope that children can come up with creative solutions to reduce our waste and energy use.\u201d\nLianne Ong, 48, and Janice Khoo, 49, co-wrote The Emperor\u2019s Gazillion New Toys to raise awareness about over-consumption.\nOng says: \u201cWe kept key elements from the original story such as the Emperor\u2019s desire for more or \u2018better\u2019, and the peddler characters selling their wares. The fractured fairy tale\u2019s familiarity lends humour to the story.\u201d\nKids can learn to be more mindful of their decisions\u2019 impact on the environment, says Khoo, adding: \u201cWe believe it is possible to start with small steps. For example, by asking, do I really need that new toy?\u201d\nPauline Loh\u2019s version of The Little Mermaid sees the protagonist protesting sea pollution at a parliamentary meeting.\n\u201cWhen we talk about marine consciousness, the obvious ambassador would be The Little Mermaid,\u201d says Loh, who is in her 50s. \u201cAs I researched more into how humans were polluting the sea, I felt guilty.\u201d\nThe four Singapore authors worked with illustrator Yee Wearn and Charlotte Barkla, an Australian writer and teacher.\nBarkla, who wrote the story Sustain-erella, says: \u201cI thought it would be fun to play with the idea of Cinderella being a sustainability enthusiast.\u201d\nThe 36-year-old, who teaches mathematics and science to secondary school students in Brisbane, adds: \u201cWe have only one planet, so it\u2019s important we look after it as best we can and preserve it for future generations.\u201d\nPublished by WS Education, the paperback books retail for $12.87 each and $32 as a set of four on Lazada at str.sg/iosfx"}
