But then, I believe, impact investing is needed as a follow-on from that, to be able to create the kind of sustainable financial structure that will then lead to growth,\u201d he said.\nMr Brende said tackling global challenges like the lack of healthcare and education and climate change requires the 4Ps model of public-private-philanthropic partnerships.\nBut philanthropy will not be the biggest investor for health, education and climate change solutions, even though it plays a crucial role by complementing government spending and foreign aid to fund social projects.\nOne example was how the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded the development and production of new treatments and vaccines for Covid-19. And that led governments of developing countries to channel more resources into healthcare.\nMr Brende said that for philanthropy to bring about real change, countries have to allocate resources efficiently. He highlighted how some developing countries allocate a large portion of their budget goes to defence but a very small percentage goes to healthcare.\nPhilanthropic capital will have a larger impact when accompanied by the right policies to ensure that change is effective and sustained, Mr Brende added.\n\u201cWe are willing to be a partner with you. But then you have to start to collect taxes (from the well-to-do), you have to get rid of corruption, and you have to use your money on what is very important in your society \u2013 your young people, health and what really matters.\u201d\nThe panel \u2013 which also included Dr Zhang Ya-Qin, chair professor and dean of the Institute for AI Industry Research in Tsinghua University, and Mr Ashish Dhawan, founder-CEO of Indian philanthropic organisation The Convergence Foundation \u2013 agreed that international collaboration is crucial to achieve large-scale impacts.\nDr Regina Dugan, president and chief executive of Wellcome Leap, a charitable foundation focused on health research, said philanthropy tends to be fragmented.\n\u201cIf we want some of these catalytic effects, we have to work together effectively\u201d, as global challenges are not going to be solved \u201cwithin the boundaries of the map of the world\u201d.\nMr Zobel de Ayala added: \u201cNation states are educated to compete. We\u2019re all trying to gain a competitive advantage for ourselves or our countries.\u201d\nBut when it comes to global issues like climate change and healthcare, he said: \u201cWe have to learn a new skill, which is how to build trust with each other and come together at key moments to address issues that are bigger than all of us.\u201d\nMr Brende said that for solutions to climate change, healthcare and education to be scaled up and sustainable, philanthropy capital should incentivise countries and states willing to collaborate and put \u201cbig money on it\u201d.\nCorrection note: This article has been updated for accuracy."}
