{"title": "Don't blame Nato for war in Ukraine. The roots lie in Russia itself", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2022-03-18", "content": "Stephen Kotkin is one of our most profound and prodigious scholars of Russian history. His masterwork is a biography of Joseph Stalin. So far he has published two volumes - Paradoxes Of Power, 1878-1928, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and Waiting For Hitler, 1929-1941.\nA third volume will take the story through the Second World War; Stalin's death, in 1953; and the totalitarian legacy that shaped the remainder of the Soviet experience. Taking advantage of long-forbidden archives in Moscow and beyond, Kotkin has written a biography of Stalin that surpasses those by Isaac Deutscher, Robert Conquest, Robert C. Tucker and countless others."}
