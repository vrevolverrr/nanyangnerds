These messages and e-mails often mimic those sent by legitimate postal and e-commerce logistics companies, such as Singapore Post (SingPost), and include links that lead to fake websites.\nThose who click on the phishing links are then led to key in their personal and banking details on these fake websites, only to later find unauthorised transactions on their bank accounts or credit cards.\nThe police have advised the public to take precautions like using the ScamShield App and enabling security features like transaction limits for internet banking, as well as two-factor authentication. They also urge the public to check for signs of scams with official sources, such as the ScamShield WhatsApp bot, the Anti-Scam Helpline, or the scam alert website.\nSingPost will never request for extra payments through text messages or e-mails containing links that ask for personal or banking information, the police added.\nAny legitimate payments to SingPost should be made through only the SingPost mobile app, SAM machines, or at post offices. The public is encouraged to always verify the authenticity of such communications and to be cautious of phishing websites.\nThe police also urge people to report any suspicious transactions to the bank immediately.\nThose with information on scams can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit the information online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness. All information will be kept strictly confidential.\nThose who require urgent police assistance can dial 999.\nFor more information on scams, please visit www.scamalert.sg or call the Anti-Scam Helpline at 1800-722-6688."}
