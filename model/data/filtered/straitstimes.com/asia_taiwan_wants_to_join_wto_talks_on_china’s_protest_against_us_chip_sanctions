It produces the vast majority of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, and its largest companies including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co have abided by the US curbs.\n\u201cTaiwan is requesting to join the consultation procedure to understand the supply-demand situation of chips,\u201d the Taiwanese agency said.\nThe island has no intention of supporting China\u2019s complaint, nor does the move imply \u201cany dissatisfaction with the United States\u2019 measures\u201d.\nUS trade officials are set to travel to Taipei for talks later in January. A spokesman for the US Trade Representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJapan and the Netherlands have agreed in principle to join the US in tightening controls over the export of advanced chip tech to China.\nThey are likely to adopt at least some of the sweeping measures rolled out in October to restrict the sale of equipment to Chinese firms, Bloomberg News has reported.\nYet even if China is successful with its case, the WTO lacks the ability to force the US to reverse its actions.\nCoupled with domestic economic turmoil, the curbs have hobbled a plethora of the Asian nation\u2019s biggest chip firms.\nChina\u2019s semiconductor firms are facing new challenges at home with Beijing now shying away from lavishing colossal resources on them as before.\nIt\u2019s pausing massive chip investments as a nationwide Covid-19 resurgence strains the country and its finances. Top officials are discussing alternatives to costly subsidies that have not rendered concrete results and instead encouraged both graft and the American sanctions. BLOOMBERG"}
