And clearly they are now losing this hub,\u201d Vice-Adm Neizhpapa told Reuters, in a rare interview in the port city of Odesa, ahead of Ukraine Navy Day on July 7.\nMore than 28 months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Kyiv has dealt a series of stinging blows to Moscow in the Black Sea, although Ukrainian ground troops are on the back foot across a sprawling front.\nUkraine, which has no major warships at its disposal, has used uncrewed naval boats packed with explosives to target Russian vessels and pounded the fleet\u2019s facilities and other military targets on Crimea with Storm Shadow and ATACMS missiles.\n\u201cAlmost all the main combat-ready ships have been moved by the enemy from the main base of the Black Sea Fleet, and the ships are kept in Novorossiisk, and some of them are kept in the Sea of Azov,\u201d he said.\nRussia\u2019s Novorossiisk naval base on its eastern Black Sea coast lacks the extensive facilities of Crimea\u2019s Sevastopol, which served as the storage and loading site for cruise missiles used by its warships to launch air strikes on Ukraine, he added.\n\u201cI understand that they are now trying to solve this problem in Novorossiisk,\u201d he said, describing this as a \u201cmain issue\u201d for the fleet.\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Vice-Adm Neizhpapa\u2019s remarks.\nPresident Vladimir Putin told navy chiefs in June that Russia\u2019s fleet had been replenished over recent years and that a major modernisation was under way, including steps to \u201cincrease the combat stability of the fleet\u201d and strengthen it.\nAlongside strategic bombers and ground-based launchers, missile-carrying warships and submarines play an important role in Russia\u2019s regular long-range missile attacks.\nVice-Adm Neizhpapa said Ukraine had destroyed or damaged 27 naval vessels, including five that he said were destroyed by sea mines laid by Ukrainian naval drones near the Bay of Sevastopol.\nMoscow seized and annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Before February 2022, Russia used its Black Sea Fleet, which consists of dozens of warships, to project power into the Mediterranean and the Middle East.\nThroughout the Ukraine war, Turkey, which controls the straits in and out of the Black Sea, has not allowed warships to enter or exit.\nDefensive posture\nIn a sign of their more defensive posture, some Russian warships that seldom entered the Sea of Azov to the east of Crimea are now stationed there regularly, Vice-Adm Neizhpapa said.\nMonitoring data compiled by the Ukrainian Navy and provided to Reuters showed that as at June 27, 10 Russian warships were stationed in the Sea of Azov, compared with none in 2023.\nThe Black Sea Fleet is primarily used now for logistics, a small amount of coastal territorial control and for firing Kalibr cruise missiles at Ukraine, he said.\nHe declined to say what Ukraine\u2019s future plans in the Black Sea would involve.\nUkraine\u2019s operations in the Black Sea have allowed it to establish and secure its own shipping corridor without Russia\u2019s blessing after Moscow pulled out of the wartime food export deal brokered by the UN in 2023.\nThe pushback began with Ukrainian coastal defences that allowed it to force naval vessels away. In April 2022, Ukrainian anti-ship missiles sank the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, in a humiliating blow for the Kremlin.\nWith the addition of naval drone attacks and strikes, Russian warships do not enter the north-western part of the Black Sea over an area of almost 25,000 sq km, Vice-Adm Neizhpapa said.\nHe said the delivery of US-made F-16 fighter aircraft, expected to happen soon, would be a boost, allowing Ukraine to challenge what he called Russia\u2019s \u201cfull dominance\u201d of the skies over the Black Sea.\n\u201cF-16s with the right armaments will be able to push away Russian warplanes. The north-western part of the Black Sea, particularly the corridor for civilian ships, will be almost 100 per cent secure,\u201d he said."}
