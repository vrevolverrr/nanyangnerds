Raja Kumar, senior adviser for international matters at the Ministry of Home Affairs, is currently the president of the FATF.\nFATF defines proliferation financing as providing funds or financial services for activities such as manufacturing, acquiring, possessing or transporting nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery and related materials, in contravention of national laws or international obligations.\nMs Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Health, told Parliament: \u201cSingapore is a leading financial centre and a global trading hub. Our economic openness makes us attractive for investments and businesses, but also makes us an attractive target for money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing.\n\u201cAs a trusted international financial and trading hub, Singapore takes a firm stance against these activities. We therefore take a robust approach to supervision, both in the financial and the non-financial sectors, in order to prevent financial crimes.\u201d\nMs Rahayu noted that many business entities covered by the Bill already have relevant measures in place as part of their existing anti-money laundering controls, as the underlying proliferation financing offences are also money laundering predicate offences. A predicate offence is a crime that is a component of a more complex criminal activity.\nBut the amended rules will strengthen those controls through measures such as preventing persons convicted of offences relating to the prevention of financial crimes from obtaining certain licences, or from holding management functions in moneylending and pawnbroking businesses.\nIn addition, the controls in the Moneylenders Act and Pawnbrokers Act against criminals owning or managing moneylending and pawnbroking businesses will be strengthened, in line with the FATF recommendations, said Ms Rahayu.\nThe Bill also updates the definition of \u201cprecious product\u201d under the PSPM Act. It currently covers any jewellery, watch, apparel, accessory, ornament, or other finished product made up of, containing, or having attached to it, any precious stone or precious metal which makes up at least 50 per cent of the value of the product.\nMs Rahayu said that this definition does not capture products with a majority of value attributed to other factors, such as branding or workmanship.\n\u201cHowever, we have observed that such products can also pose risks of financial crimes,\u201d she said.\nTo close this gap, the definition is being changed to cover any \u201cprecious product\u201d priced above a prescribed value, which will be set at $20,000, regardless of the value attributable to the PSPM.\nThis would include, for instance, a platinum watch retailed by a luxury brand with a net sales price of $100,000, even if the value of the platinum in the watch is less than 50 per cent of the net sales price.\nSpeaking during the debate on the Bill, Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) said he supported the amendments but was concerned about how the Government plans to build up capacity of business entities to comply with the new requirements.\nHe said: \u201cOverly strict safeguards can be counterproductive if entities do not have the capacity to ensure meaningful compliance with these safeguards. What steps will be taken at the industry level to avoid these safeguards from becoming a box-checking exercise?\u201d\nMs Rahayu said that the Ministry of Law will carry out inspections, investigations and enforcement to ensure compliance."}
