I think a significant step will be taken forward,\" Mr Erdogan told PBS television late on Monday.\nTurkey, a member of the United States-led military alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, has tried to stay neutral in the conflict, supplying combat drones to Kyiv and shying away from Western-led sanctions against Moscow.\nAsked repeatedly if Mr Putin should be held responsible for invading Ukraine, Mr Erdogan said there was no benefit in taking sides.\n\"We are not going to defend a single leader. Instead, we have to look for a solution that will satisfy all the parties involved.\" BLOOMBERG, AFP"}
