But the Japanese public \u2013 which voted the character for \u201cbattle\u201d, read as sen or ikusa, as the kanji character of 2022 \u2013 has been jolted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and heightened military activity in the Asian region.\nTo fund a slew of new armaments, Japan will ramp up defence spending to 43 trillion yen (S$426.6 billion) for the five-year period ending in fiscal year 2027, up by 56 per cent from 27.5 trillion yen in the current spending plan.\nThis will make it the third-largest spender after the United States and China on current budgets, and bring its defence spending to 2 per cent of gross domestic product \u2013 blowing past a cap of 1 per cent self-imposed in 1976.\nChina slammed the policy revisions, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin accusing Japan of \u201cdisregarding facts, discrediting China, and deviating from the common understanding between China and Japan and its commitment to bilateral relations\u201d.\n\u201cHyping up the \u2018China threat\u2019 to find an excuse for its military build-up is doomed to fail,\u201d he said.\nJapan\u2019s first revision of its National Security Strategy in nearly a decade came after China sent missiles into waters near Okinawa prefecture in August. North Korea, which Japan referred to as an \u201ceven more grave and imminent threat than ever before\u201d in the strategy, sent a missile over Hokkaido in October.\nThe strategy also labelled Russia as a \u201cstrong security concern\u201d, citing the deployment of armaments on disputed territory north of Hokkaido and Moscow\u2019s \u201cdoubling down on strategic coordination\u201d with Beijing.\n\u201cWe conducted a realistic simulation of whether current capabilities held by the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) were sufficient to deter threats and protect the nation,\u201d Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a news conference on Friday. \u201cFrankly, the current capabilities are insufficient.\u201d\nThe 10-year National Defence Strategy and the five-year defence build-up programme were also revised on Friday, with Mr Kishida warning that Japan must act with urgency.\n\u201cJapan\u2019s security environment is as severe and complex as it has ever been since the end of World War II... In the vicinity of Japan, military build-ups, including of nuclear weapons and missiles, are rapidly advancing, coupled with mounting pressures by unilaterally changing the status quo by force,\u201d the documents said, in clear reference to North Korea and China\u2019s stance on Taiwan.\nAmong the measures considered necessary as a deterrent was the \u201ccounterstrike capability\u201d that will allow the SDF to launch targeted strikes on enemy bases if Japan\u2019s survival is endangered.\nThis marks a turning point, given the pacifist post-war Constitution enacted in 1947, with a previous defence policy indicating that Japan will \u201cnot have the means to attack an opponent country\u201d.\nBut Mr Kishida said there was no contradiction, given that Japan will keep its exclusively defence-oriented posture and use such counterstrike capabilities only under the strictest of standards and as a matter of last resort.\n\u201cAs a peace-loving nation, Japan will adhere to the basic policy of maintaining an exclusively national defence-oriented policy, not becoming a military power that poses a threat to other countries,\u201d he said."}
