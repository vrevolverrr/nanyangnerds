The nation has since confirmed it will receive vaccine deliveries more quickly over the next two months.\n\"With the latest supply schedule, we can further boost our vaccination programme. We can offer the vaccine to everyone, even sooner than we expected,\" he said.\nHe urged: \"Whether you are old or young, please come forward to be vaccinated once it is your turn. With the more infectious virus strains, we need as many people as possible to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity, or get close to it.\n\"This is the way to make everyone safe and resume more normal activities.\""}
