Both projects are worth about US$3 billion. Exxon Mobil Corp. said it would \u201cdiscontinue\u201d its Sakhalin-I operations.\nEquinor ASA, Norway\u2019s state-owned energy giant, said it will start withdrawing from its joint ventures in Russia, worth about US$1.2 billion. In parallel, Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, is freezing Russian assets worth about US$2.8 billion and said it will come up with a plan to exit by March 15.\nFinance\nVisa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. said on March 5 they are suspending operations in Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had called on the companies to halt all business in Russia during a video call with US lawmakers. Each of the firms gets about 4 per cent of its net revenue from business linked to the country. American Express followed the next day.\nSome critics argued that the steps aren\u2019t enough. While the companies said any transactions initiated with their cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and cards issued outside of Russia won\u2019t work at Russian merchants or ATMs, consumers inside Russia who have a locally issued card can still pay for goods and services there.\nPayPal said on Tuesday it\u2019s also suspending services. The company said it can\u2019t \u201creasonably estimate the total potential financial impact that may ultimately result from this situation.\u201d Fitch Group and Moody\u2019s Corp. both said they are suspending operations in Russia. The two ratings companies have both slashed Russia\u2019s ratings to junk.\nAutomakers\nIn the space of a week, most of the world\u2019s biggest carmakers including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG, and Toyota Motor Corp. announced they would halt shipments to Russia or idle plants in the country. Truckmakers Volvo AB and Daimler Truck Holding AG also stopped business activities there.\nThe automaker with the most to lose, Renault SA, has remained quiet.\nThe French company\u2019s majority control of AvtoVaz, the Soviet-era maker of Ladas, and reliance on Russia for about 12 per cent of its revenue have unnerved investors and Renault has lost more than a third of its market value in two weeks. \u201cRenault has promised to abide by sanctions,\u201d Gabriel Attal, the French government spokesman, said on March 3 on France Info radio.\nConsumer goods\nMcDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola and Starbucks Corp. announced they would temporarily halt operations in Russia in a flurry of announcements on Tuesday afternoon. PepsiCo Inc. said it would suspend soft-drink sales in the country but would continue to sell daily essentials such as milk and baby formula.\nSome companies\u2019 withdrawal makes it easier for others to do the same, said Gene Grabowski, a partner at communications firm KGlobal. Coca-Cola, for example, is a supplier for McDonald\u2019s, so McDonald\u2019s action deprives it of a major client in the country.\nLevi Strauss & Co. whose jeans were a coveted black-market item in the Soviet Union, also suspended commercial operations in Russia, where it gets about 2 per cent of its sales. The \u201cenormous disruption occurring in the region\u201d has made it \u201cuntenable\u201d to conduct business as normal, the company said Monday. \u201cAny business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many.\u201d\nSamsung Electronics Co., the leading smartphone seller in Russia with more than 30 per cent of the market, suspended exports to Russia of all its products. Samsung said it will donate US$6 million to humanitarian efforts in the region, including US$1 million in consumer electronics products.\nAmazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud-computing unit announced in a blog post it will stop accepting new customers in Russia or Belarus. The company said its Amazon Web Services unit had \u201cno data centers, infrastructure or offices in Russia, and we have a long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government. We have also stopped allowing new sign-ups for AWS in Russia and Belarus.\u201d\nMicrosoft on March 4 condemned the \u201cunjustified, unprovoked and unlawful invasion\u201d of Ukraine and said it\u2019s suspending all new sales of products and services in Russia. Apple Inc. halted sales of iPhones and started limiting Apple Pay services and other products in Russia, and removed the RT News and Sputnik News applications from App Stores outside the country. HP Inc., the largest supplier of PCs to Russia, has stopped exports to the country, as has Intel Corp.\nNike Inc. is one of several consumer goods companies that have cited logistical problems as a reason for suspending sales in Russia.\nSpanish fashion retailer Inditex SA, which has 502 stores in Russia, including 86 Zara outlets, is also temporarily closing all its shops there and halting online sales, saying it \u201ccannot guarantee the continuity of operations and trading conditions.\u201d\nOthers have so far taken limited steps to halt business. Danone SA\u2019s General Secretary Laurent Sacchi said the world\u2019s largest yogurt maker would suspend investment in Russia, but will continue to sell dairy and baby food.\nMedia\nNetflix Inc. is shutting its operations in Russia and said no new customers will be able to sign up, though it\u2019s unclear what will happen with existing accounts.\nNetflix has fewer than one million customers in Russia and has been operating in the country through a partnership with National Media Group. The streaming giant said previously it won\u2019t be carrying required Russian news channels on its local-language service in the country and has paused all projects and acquisitions from Russia, including four programs in production.\nHollywood studios including Walt Disney Co., Paramount Pictures, Sony Corp., and AT&T Inc.\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Pictures have also halted or postponed the release of movies in Russia.\nMeanwhile other platforms, including TikTok, are suspending or closing services because of Russia\u2019s new \u201cfake news\u201d law aimed at silencing dissent and limiting information about the invasion of Ukraine. The company, owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., said its in-app messaging service would not be affected.\nOn March 4, the Russian government said it was blocking access to Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Facebook as part of the crackdown. Hours after the announcement, Meta said it would pause all advertising in the nation and would stop selling ads to Russian businesses. The company\u2019s Instagram platform will start to label posts from Russian state media with a warning, ranking them lower and making them harder to find on the app worldwide."}
