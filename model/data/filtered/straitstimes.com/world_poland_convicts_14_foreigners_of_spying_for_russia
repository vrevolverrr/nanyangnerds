His arrest in June prompted a \u201cstrong protest\u201d from Moscow and a demand for a \u201ccomprehensive explanation\u201d.\nRussian state media identified him as Maxim Sergeyev, who played for Zaglebie Sosnowiec in the south-western Polish city of Sosnowiec.\nThe ring also included two Ukrainian lawyers, a political scientist, a French language teacher, a pharmacy technician, and a software engineer, the Rzeczpospolita daily reported.\nPaid in cryptocurrency\nInvestigators said the members of the ring received their orders via the Telegram messaging app and were paid in cryptocurrency.\nPolish media reported they received between US$300 (S$400) and US$10,000 dollars.\nProsecutor Piotr Lopatynski highlighted the role played by Telegram and cryptocurrency.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a new, perhaps hitherto unknown way of running or organising a spy network in Poland,\u201d he told reporters.\nMost of the members of the spy ring were detained in March.\nPoland\u2019s then Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak had said at the time that \u201cthe threat was real\u201d."}
