Rivers vibrant, full of wildlife, plants and fish, become wastelands of death and despair,\u201d Mr Khan said.\nMr Khan intends to issue a general policy paper in December that would set the legal framework for environmental crimes without having to add a fifth offence to the four listed in the Rome Statute.\n\u201cThis is the first time in the history of the International Criminal Court that we would have a considered policy paper on the forms that environmental crimes can take,\u201d he said.\nIn 2016, former ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said the court would focus on ecological damage, the illicit exploitation of natural resources or the illegal expropriation of land, a warning that had little visible impact.\nBut Mr Khan insisted his initiative was a step further as it was a thought-out policy rather than a promise or hope.\nMr Khan was speaking in Paris on the sidelines of a gathering of around 100 prosecutors and senior judges who were discussing behind closed doors the role of young people in environmental justice.
