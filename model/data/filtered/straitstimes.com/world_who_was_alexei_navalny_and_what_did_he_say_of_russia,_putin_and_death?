Navalny\u2019s movement is outlawed and most of his senior allies have fled Russia and now live in Europe.\nRussian officials cast Navalny as an extremist who was a puppet of the US\u2019 Central Intelligence Agency that they say is intent on trying to sow the seeds of revolution to weaken Russia and make it a client state of the West.\nNavalny was detained countless times for organising public rallies, and prosecuted repeatedly on charges including corruption, embezzlement and fraud. He said the accusations and convictions were politically motivated.\nNavalny had an extra 19 years in a maximum security penal colony added to his jail term in 2023 in a criminal case that he said was designed to cow the Russian people into political submission.\nPoisoning\nIn August 2020, Navalny fell ill on a flight from Tomsk, in Siberia, to Moscow.\nThe pilot made an emergency landing, saving his life, and Navalny was flown to Berlin, where he was treated for the effects of a neurotoxin that German military tests showed to be Novichok, a poison developed in the Soviet Union.\nMr Putin dismissed a joint media investigation that said it had identified a team of assassins from Russia\u2019s FSB security service. \u201cIf someone had wanted to poison him, they would have finished him off,\u201d he said.\nFamily\nNavalny\u2019s wife is Yulia. They have a daughter, Darya, and a son, Zakhar.\nKey Navalny quotes\nOn the Ukraine war:\n\u201cThis is a stupid war which your Putin started,\u201d Navalny told an appeal court in Moscow via video link from a corrective penal colony in 2022. \u201cThis war was built on lies.\u201d\n\u201cOne madman has got his claws into Ukraine and I do not know what he wants to do with it \u2013 this crazy thief.\u201d\nOn Putin:\n\u201cCorruption is the foundation of contemporary Russia, it is the foundation of Mr Putin\u2019s political power,\u201d Navalny told Reuters in an interview in 2011.\nOn Russia:\n\u201cOnce the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy described the structure of power in Russia: \u2018the villains who robbed their own people got together, recruited soldiers and judges to guard their orgy, and now they\u2019re having a feast\u2019. This brilliant phrase precisely describes what is happing in our country.\u201d\nIn 2023, he admonished the Russian elite for its venality, expressing hatred for those who he said squandered a historic opportunity to reform after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.\nHe dissected Russia\u2019s post-Soviet history, including the legacies of the most powerful figures of the 1990s who became known as the reformers who sought to lay the foundations of capitalism and the oligarchs who won fabulous fortunes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop myself from fiercely, wildly hating those who sold, pissed away, and squandered the historical chance that our country had in the early nineties,\u201d Navalny said.\nOn fear and ambition:\n\u201cWhy should I be afraid?\u201d he said in 2011 when asked about the dangers of challenging the Kremlin.\nWhen asked by Reuters about his ambition, he winced but said: \u201cI would like to be president, but there are no elections in Russia.\u201d\nOn death:\n\u201cIf they decide to kill me then it means we are incredibly strong, and we need to use that power and not give up,\u201d he once told CNN. \u201cWe don\u2019t realise how strong we actually are.\u201d REUTERS"}
