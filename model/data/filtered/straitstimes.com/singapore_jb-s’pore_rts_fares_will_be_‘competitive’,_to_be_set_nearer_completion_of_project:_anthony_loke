Ridership in the first year is expected to be about 40,000 passengers daily.\nThe ride will take five minutes each way.\nMr Loke said the RTS Link will reduce congestion on the Causeway by 35 per cent. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, over 350,000 people used the land link daily.\nMalaysia\u2019s then Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong said in 2020 that fares for the RTS Link would be affordable and set with the lower-income in mind. He also said ticket prices would be the same on both sides of the Causeway, factoring in currency conversion rates.\nCurrently, there is a variety of transport options for those travelling between Singapore and Johor Bahru, in addition to driving or walking across the border.\nCross-border public bus services such as 170 and 950 charge regular public transport distance fares. A ride from Queen Street Terminal in Singapore to Larkin Terminal in Johor Bahru costs $2.30.\nThere are also private bus services that ply a range of cross-border routes, with fares starting from $1.80 in Singapore and RM2.60 in Johor.\nAsked on Jan 11 whether there are plans for more ferry services linking Johor and Singapore, Mr Loke said Malaysia will consider any proposals from the private sector to improve connectivity between Malaysia and Singapore.\nHowever, more discussion is needed as any new cross-border links will need approval from the authorities on both sides. This is because a lot of infrastructure and facilities will be needed, he added.\nMr Loke said the RTS Link is poised to be a major driver of socio-economic development.\nMr Chee noted that the project is \u201cmuch more than building bridges\u201d.\n\u201cIt is about building stronger ties between the people of Singapore and the people of Malaysia,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is also about building a better future for both countries, strengthening our longstanding friendship and creating more win-win opportunities for our businesses and citizens.\u201d"}
