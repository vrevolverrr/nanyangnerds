This very clearly identifies China as one of the challenges that the region faces... but our China strategy is global in scope. It recognises the Indo-Pacific as a particularly intense region of competition.\nHe added: \u201cCountries in the region want to see the US continuing to play an important role. They want to continue to see an affirmative US vision for what we are doing that is not couched in suggesting the countries need to take sides.\nAmerican Enterprise Institute senior fellow Zack Cooper said the strategy was likely written with South-east Asia in mind.\n\u201cIt tries to articulate a positive vision for the United States in the region and focuses less on China. I think that\u2019s the right approach,\u201d he told The Straits Times.\n\u201cThe question, however, is whether the administration will be able to convince regional players that it is willing and able to expend sufficient resources on Asia while it is addressing responsibilities elsewhere,\u201d Dr Cooper added."}
