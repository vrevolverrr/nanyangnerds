It was actually, \u2018You are among us, and we are among you\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI believe such inherent friendship is very precious these days as it\u2019s beyond politics \u2013 the human solidarity in times of war.\u201d\n\u2018First-person record\u2019\nThe Chinese government selected 100 officers between 1943 and 1944 to receive training in the United States and Britain to rebuild China\u2019s naval force after it was destroyed by Japan, one of the Axis powers aligned with Nazi Germany.\nThe first batch of 24 officers sent to Britain included Mr Lam and his comrade Huang Tingxin, whose son, Professor Huang Shansong, will attend the Hong Kong exhibition.\n\u201cThe strategic consideration at that time was to connect China\u2019s fight with the world\u2019s anti-fascist war... so that with the support from the US and Britain, China could better defend Japan\u2019s invasion,\u201d said Prof Huang, who teaches Chinese history at a university in Hangzhou.\nProf Huang published a book of his father\u2019s oral history in 2013 but said he found Mr Lam\u2019s diary more valuable for its accuracy, compared with his father\u2019s decades-old memories.\n\u201cLam\u2019s diary is by far the only first-person, on-the-spot record about the 24 men\u2019s internship in Britain that is known to us today,\u201d he said.\nHe has loaned his father\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur \u2013 awarded in 2006 for the elder Mr Huang\u2019s contribution to France\u2019s liberation \u2013 for the exhibition.\n\u201cHe always told me wars, in particular modern wars, were shockingly destructive,\u201d Prof Huang said.\n\u201cThe importance of peace cannot be emphasised more.\u201d\n\u2018A wider audience\u2019\nMr Lam\u2019s diary almost ended up in landfills.\nAfter the war, the naval commander lived in Hong Kong until the late 1960s and left the bulk of his personal items \u2013 including the diary \u2013 in his brother\u2019s apartment.\nRescued by a photographer and an amateur historian before the building was demolished, the diary caught the interest of Mr Angus Hui, a former journalist who obtained a photocopy for his postgraduate study in Chinese naval history.\nMr Hui met Mr Mok in 2023, who suggested that the stories \u201cdeserve a wider audience\u201d.\nDuring research trips to China, Taiwan, Singapore and Europe, where the veterans settled after the war, they found that Hong Kong was the most suitable place for the exhibition.\nMr Hui said he hopes that the exhibition can address Hong Kong\u2019s place in today\u2019s world.\nThe former British colony \u2013 once branded \u201cAsia\u2019s World City\u201d \u2013 has fallen out of favour in recent years with Western governments, which have condemned Hong Kong over a rights crackdown following democracy protests in 2019.\nBut Mr Lam\u2019s decision to come to Hong Kong \u201creflected the uniqueness of this place\u201d, Mr Hui said.\n\u201cPeople may say Hong Kong is no longer relevant... But from history and from our own experience, we find Hong Kong still relevant.\u201d AFP"}
