The PFPAD initially suggested the establishment of the tribunal last year.\nHe said the tribunal would require a \"positive decision\" by the U.N. General Assembly, the main policy-making organ of the organisation.\n\"Let us resolve to put in the international advocacy work to successfully deliver the creation of this critical institution at the U.N. General Assembly,\" he added. \"Let us all rally around the forum and make this happen.\"\nAt the session, representatives of other nations, such as of Guyana and Venezuela, echoed Comissiong's call.\nIn a video message at the opening of the PFPAD session on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres reiterated that racism was based on centuries of enslavement and colonialism. He said reparations should be part of efforts to tackle it.\nThe idea of paying reparations or making other amends for transatlantic slavery has a long history and remains deeply disputed, but has been gaining momentum worldwide.\nEven supporters of the tribunal recognise that establishing it will not be easy. Hurdles include obtaining the cooperation of nations that were involved in transatlantic slavery and the legal complexities of finding responsible parties and determining remedies. REUTERS"}
