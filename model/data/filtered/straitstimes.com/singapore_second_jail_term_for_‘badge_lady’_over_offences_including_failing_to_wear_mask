She told the judge that there was no need for a deterrent sentence, and added: \u201cThe offences are no longer offences today.\u201d\nWithout revealing details, she said she was medically unfit to be in prison and that her earlier duties with the Singapore Armed Forces should be taken into consideration. Phoon also said that she had a clean record while serving the navy.\nBefore handing down the sentence, District Judge Tan Jen Tse noted that Phoon was a recalcitrant offender. He also found that she was unremorseful and unrepentant. \u201cShe had not learnt her lesson,\u201d he added.\nFollowing a trial, the judge had convicted her on Aug 11, 2023, of three charges under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and one charge under the Infectious Diseases Act.\nPhoon was not wearing a mask at the Mandarin Gallery in Orchard Road from 3.02pm to 3.04pm on March 6, 2022.\nShe committed a similar offence while walking past a Victoria\u2019s Secret shop in Orchard Road between 3.35pm and 3.37pm the same day.\nWearing a mask outdoors became optional in Singapore only from March 29, 2022.\nOn Aug 16, 2022, Phoon again failed to don a mask while walking within Ion Orchard shopping mall.\nMask-wearing indoors in places such as malls was made optional only from Aug 29, 2022.\nShortly before her conviction in August 2023, Phoon said there was no longer a requirement to wear a mask, and questioned the need for prosecution. She said then: \u201cIf the section (in the Covid-19 [Temporary Measures] Act 2020) has been revoked, then why are we sitting here discussing an offence that is no longer an offence?\n\u201cIt comes across as being very vindictive, it comes across as getting back (at) this person, looking for the slightest problem.\u201d\nDPP Kaur, however, stressed that the acts were chargeable offences at the times when Phoon failed to wear a mask in public.\nSeparately, Phoon had failed to attend an interview for an investigation by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) regarding a mask-related offence.\nShe did not comply with the first two orders on March 19 and 23, 2022, and she made a police report on March 24, 2022, accusing someone of impersonating STB officers.\nOn the same day she made the police report, STB\u2019s investigation officers explained to Phoon what their powers were and showed her their badges.\nPhoon then suggested going to STB on March 31, said the prosecutor. However, she did not turn up or answer the officers\u2019 calls.\nShe had earlier claimed that anybody familiar with the STB would know that it \u201cdoes not have enforcement powers\u201d, and stated that she had filed the police report as a dutiful citizen.\nShe also cast doubt on the closed-circuit television footage of her not wearing a mask that was submitted as evidence, describing it as \u201cstaged\u201d footage that did not verify her identity."}
