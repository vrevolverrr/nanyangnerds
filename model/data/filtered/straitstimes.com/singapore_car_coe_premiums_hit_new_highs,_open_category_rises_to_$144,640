At $10,700, the price was 1.84 per cent lower than the $10,901 posted two weeks ago.\nNew highs have been set in all categories of COE in 2023, with the exception of motorcycles.\nSome car brands had hosted road shows and dangled generous discounts to get more orders since the last tender.\nThere were 470 unsuccessful bids in total over the two car COE categories, slightly more than the 457 unsuccessful bids seen in the previous round.\nA sizeable proportion of these bidders would return for the next tender to secure the needed COEs, suggesting that the upward pressure on prices is not expected to ease.\nMr Ng Choon Wee, group commercial director at Komoco Motors, attributed the high COE premiums to dealers who may be chasing after their year-end sales targets to qualify for incentives.\nCalling the record COE premiums \u201cabsurd\u201d, Mr Nicholas Wong, who is the general manager of Honda agent Kah Motor, said the surge is also driven by a sense of uncertainty for the new year.\nCars are expected to cost more in the new year. The EV Early Adoption Incentive, which gives rebates of up to $20,000 off vehicle taxes for EVs, ends on Dec 31 this year, and it is unclear what will happen to the scheme.\nFrom Jan 1, 2024, the pollutant thresholds for private cars under the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) will be tightened, though details of the revised VES have yet to be announced.\nMotor traders say they are assuming that cars with pure internal combustion engines, as opposed to petrol-hybrids or EVs, will be downgraded to a less favourable band under the updated VES. This is expected to make such vehicles harder to sell in the new year as they would likely come with reduced rebates, or even incur higher penalties under the VES.\nAssociate Professor Walter Theseira, a transport economist at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, noted that the big swings in COE premiums, because of how the COE supply moves in 10-year cycles, is not ideal.\n\u201cA stable price would be better for the economy and better reflect the actual demand for car travel,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhy should rental-fleet owners get a windfall just because they procured their fleet a few years ago?\u201d he added, referring to how vehicles bought earlier when COE premiums were lower would be worth more at today\u2019s COE prices.\nGoldbell Corp board adviser Ng Lee Kwang said: \u201cThis COE situation is getting out of hand. This is not good for anybody.\u201d\nMr Ng Lee Kwang, who also teaches transport topics as an adjunct lecturer at Nanyang Institute of Management, warns that cars registered with such expensive COEs would be difficult to sell in the used market when COE premiums eventually come down.\nMr Mohammad Iskandar Tobari, 51, is in no hurry to replace his five-year-old Subaru Forester, which he bought brand new.\nThe technician, whose 19-year-old daughter has just started taking driving lessons, said: \u201cWith car prices so high, I don\u2019t know why she even wants to get a licence.\u201d"}
