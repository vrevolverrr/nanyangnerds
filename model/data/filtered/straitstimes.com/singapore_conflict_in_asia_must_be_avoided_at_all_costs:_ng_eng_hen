CNBC senior correspondent Silvia Amaro moderated the panel.\nWhen asked about the large sums of defence spending in the Indo-Pacific and whether there is an arms race, Dr Ng said countries cannot be stopped from deciding they are going to spend to protect their interests.\nHe noted that by 2030, the United States will spend about US$1 trillion (S$1.35 trillion) on defence each year while China will spend about US$500 billion.\nDr Ng also made the point that no one had predicted the Israel-Hamas conflict several years ago.\n\u201cThe lessons for this are very clear. We should avoid conflict in Asia at all costs,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing justifies it, in my mind.\u201d\nDr Ng added that the world \u201ccannot have three simultaneous theatres of instability\u201d \u2013 referring to the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the looming spectre of conflict between the US and China.\n\u201cIf indeed there is a conflict for whatever reason between the US and China, I think we will have blighted our futures for the next, well, 10, 20, 30 years.\u201d\nDr Ng added that he found it reassuring when Chinese President Xi Jinping met American President Joe Biden in San Francisco during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in November 2023.\n\u201cRight noises were made,\u201d he said.\nEven with Taiwan electing its new president William Lai Ching-te, who is known to be pro-independence, Dr Ng said he thought it reassuring that one of Mr Biden\u2019s first statements was that he does not support Taiwanese independence.\n\u201cIf you look at what the PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) did in response to William Lai\u2019s election, it was not much. And that was reassuring.\u201d\nAsked what keeps him up at night, Dr Ng said it was the prospect of Russia\u2019s aggression being rewarded if political support from either Western Europe or the US for Ukraine wavers as the war drags on.\n\u201cThat keeps me up at night, because if that\u2019s the established rule, then there is no future for small countries like Singapore and that\u2019s the reason why we protested very early the Russian invasion in Ukraine,\u201d he added.\n\u201cCountries will have to step up to protect their beliefs and their way of life.\u201d\nOn how to boost cooperation, Dr Ng said military-to-military engagement was crucial, especially if there are potential aggression risks.\n\u201cSo, in Asean... we are stepping up, for example, military-to-military engagement, about 18 nations, and we have to just keep working at it.\u201d"}
