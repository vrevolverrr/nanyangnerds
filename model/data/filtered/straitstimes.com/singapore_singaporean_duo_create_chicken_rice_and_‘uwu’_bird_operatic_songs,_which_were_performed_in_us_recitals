It was one piece of four-part song cycle SingBites, which was inspired by the sights, smells, sounds and tastes of Singapore.\nSpeaking to The Straits Times over a video call on Tuesday, the duo said the iconic dish is something they have missed and found hard to come by while studying or working in the US.\n\u201cI lived in the Midwestern states when I was in the US for seven to eight years, there was no chicken rice there,\u201d said Dr Ho, 31, who returned to Singapore after graduating with a Doctor of Musical Arts in Piano Performance from the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music earlier in 2023.\nHe is an artiste signed to US-based Arabesque Records and had released two albums in 2020 and 2022.\n\u201cEven if you bought chicken rice paste, you just couldn\u2019t replicate the dish. It was something I always missed.\u201d\nWith lyrics such as \u201cAunty, roasted chicken rice, da pao (take away) please. Extra chilli, xie xie ni (thank you)!\u201d sung in an operatic manner by Dr Sridhar, a snippet of the song uploaded to TikTok last Friday has garnered close to 120,000 views and 8,000 likes.\nOne netizen joked: \u201cIt\u2019s for the arts, but can we get it on the charts?\u201d\nAnother commented: \u201cThis made me realise how much I missed chicken rice.\u201d\nThe viral performance has prompted some people to contact Dr Ho about purchasing the musical score to perform at their own recitals.\nThe song cycle, which took around four months to complete, also comprises three other pieces \u2013The Uwu Bird, The Bus Stop and Singapore River.\nThe songs contain lyrics such as \u201cDear little uwu bird, I hear you calling me... Dressed in black, with ruby red eyes\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m running late for the bus again!... He\u2019s stopped for me! Wait! He\u2019s going! He\u2019s taking off again!\u201d.\n\u201cUwu\u201d is a reference to the shrill sound from the Asian koel that is often heard in Singapore.\nDr Ho says while the sound can be \u201cirritating\u201d, it is also a unique experience that Singaporeans can identify with.\nBut to Dr Sridhar, the sound of her favourite bird is \u201ccomforting\u201d.\nDr Sridhar, 33, left Singapore for the US when she was 17 to complete her undergraduate, master\u2019s and doctorate studies, while her parents remained in Singapore.\nShe serves as the chair of the voice area in DePauw University in Indiana. An active freelance performer, she has been trying to get grants to commission a collection of Singaporean songs since 2019.\nShe said: \u201cWhen I chat with my parents in the night where I am but it is morning in Singapore, I can hear the birds in the background. Even if the birds are far away, the sound really picks up.\u201d\nYet despite her love for the koel, which can be found all across Singapore in forests, parks and urban areas, Dr Sridhar has a soft spot for the song Singapore River, which she says is her favourite among the four.\n\u201cThere is a line in the last song that\u2019s my favourite \u2013 \u2018My home, my home to all who come,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\u201cEvery time I sing it, I put my hand to my heart.\u201d\nBy writing these songs about the core experiences of being Singaporean, Dr Ho hopes they would appeal to Singaporeans from all walks of life and take local music to the global stage.\nHe said: \u201cMost people would not set foot into an art song recital, so I was thinking, \u2018How do I make this accessible to Singaporeans?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe goal was to write something that people can hum when they walk away from a concert,\u201d said Dr Ho, who added that after the performance went viral, his colleague remarked that her son was trying to sing and play the songs on the piano.\nWith plans to expand upon the success of these songs, the two have begun collaborating on a larger compendium of Singaporean art songs.\nDr Ho said: \u201cWe hope to do a concert series where I play the piano and Janani sings. We would also love to record the songs commercially. We are thinking of applying to organisations for funds as it can get expensive, especially as we are not living in the same country.\u201d"}
