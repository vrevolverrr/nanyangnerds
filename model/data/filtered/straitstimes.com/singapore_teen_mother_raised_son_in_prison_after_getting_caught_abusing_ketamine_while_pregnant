But I was addicted to ketamine, and went back to jail a year later.\n\u201cWhen I was sentenced the second time, I was five months\u2019 pregnant.\u201d\nShe was sentenced to two years in jail.\nIn prison, she attended monthly check-ups, which were increased to weekly during the last month of her pregnancy.\nWhen she reached full term, she was warded at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital, where she gave birth to her son. Fortunately, he was healthy.\n\u201cI went through labour like any other person. The only difference was that I had my ankle cuffed to the bed and two prison wardens monitoring me,\u201d she recalled.\nTwo days later, Ms Chun returned to prison with her son. She and her baby shared a cell with another mother and her baby.\n\u201cI essentially raised my baby from that cell. He had a small mattress to sleep on, while I slept on a straw mat. I bathed him with tap water, which was sometimes cold.\n\u201cThis was how all the other prisoners used to clean themselves,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEven though I understood that I was in prison for a reason, raising my baby from behind bars made me realise that I should have been a better mother for my son. I didn\u2019t want him to follow in my footsteps.\u201d\nWhen Ms Chun\u2019s son was a month old, he began to suffer severe rashes on his skin.\n\u201cThere was no proper care for the baby, so I let my sister take care of him while I served my time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was tough, but the right decision to make.\u201d\nHer sister was 22 years old at the time, and visited Ms Chun twice a month with the baby for the rest of her jail term.\n\u201cHaving to give up my baby was a turning point for me. I told myself it would be the last time I would be behind bars. I had to make my life right for him,\u201d she said.\nMs Chun, who has two other boys, aged 11 and eight, and a four-year-old daughter, now volunteers at non-profit organisations to speak to women who are struggling with drug addiction.\nShe is concerned about mothers who abuse drugs, adding: \u201cI know many mothers who take drugs are trying hard to quit, but when addiction is involved, it is easier said than done.\u201d\nMs Chun, a housewife, said she relapsed in 2007, two years after being released from prison.\nBut she was determined to give up drugs after seeing her son, then three years old, mimicking her behaviour of smoking cigarettes.\nShe finally managed to kick the habit in 2009.\n\u201cI hope these mothers realise that they need to seek help early, and if they are separated from their children for a while, it is only for the best.\u201d\nMs Chun said she is heartened that there are more programmes now to support women who have children and are going through struggles with addiction.\n\u201cI am looking into spending the next part of my life creating a safe place for such women to rebuild their lives and be able to fulfil their roles as mothers.\n\u201cIt may not necessarily be a programme, but a safe space where they can seek refuge, so these mothers can ultimately be present for their children,\u201d she said.\nThe Singapore Prison Service (SPS) said it \u201crecognises that a stable family is a key factor in enabling successful rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders\u201d.\nIt works with community partners which specialise in working with inmates\u2019 families and children to provide programmes and services for them.\nThese programmes include the Initiative for Incarcerated Mothers and Affected Children by the Singapore After-Care Association.\nSPS said: \u201cIt provides an avenue for the mothers to relay concerns about their children while its personnel looks into the safety of the child and assesses caregiving arrangements through home visits.\u201d\nThere is also the Salvation Army\u2019s Prison Support Services \u2013 Kids In Play. The programme aims to strengthen the relationship between offenders and their children.\nA spokesman for the SPS said two family bonding sessions are conducted in various institutions each year, during the June and December school holidays, for those affected to spend more time together.\nHe added that inmates, including incarcerated mothers, are allowed visitations with their families twice a month.\nAdditionally, inmates can also connect with them through e-letters, and those with good behaviour can accumulate incentive points that can be exchanged for additional visits for more time with loved ones.\nMany halfway homes for former drug users in Singapore cater to men. An exception is The Turning Point, which in 2022 assisted 25 women through its programmes.\nMs Christina Arumugam, executive director of the non-profit charitable organisation, said that nearly 95 per cent of these women are mothers. All were drug users.\n\u201cWe typically do not accommodate pregnant women, and any pregnant residents will be referred to alternative arrangements.\n\u201cIn the coming year, we are exploring additional approaches to enhance the support we offer these mothers and their families as part of our ongoing efforts to make a meaningful difference in their lives,\u201d said Ms Arumugam, who added that The Turning Point assisted 34 women in 2021.\nTo support these women, the charity provides counselling, and works on strengthening family support. It also educates the women on parenting skills and child development.\n\u201cWe firmly believe in the importance of family and strive to keep our residents connected with their loved ones, especially their children, through family visits held every fortnight,\u201d said Ms Arumugam.\nShe said many of the women are seeking assistance in areas such as education and employment, which are crucial in empowering them as they reintegrate into society.\n\u201cWe are actively seeking funding support or partners who can provide training and employment opportunities to equip our residents with the necessary skills and experience,\u201d Ms Arumugam added."}
