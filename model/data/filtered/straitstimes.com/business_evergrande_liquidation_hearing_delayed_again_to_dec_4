By the end of the following year, Evergrande had defaulted.\nThe liquidation hearing originates from a wind-up lawsuit filed by a creditor, Top Shine Global Limited of Intershore Consult (Samoa), who was a strategic investor in Evergrande\u2019s online sales platform.\nThe Hong Kong court has issued at least three winding-up orders for Chinese developers since the nation\u2019s property debt crisis began, despite thorny jurisdictional issues and China\u2019s interest in keeping developers afloat to ensure homebuyers get the houses they have paid for.\nThe fate of the builder and even bigger peer Country Garden Holdings \u2013 deemed in default for the first time in recent days \u2013 is of broader significance to an economy where the property market and related industries account for about 20 per cent of gross domestic product.\nAs the real estate crisis came to threaten worse contagion, the authorities have recently taken steps to fine-tune policy, including a broad relaxation of down payment requirements for homes and cuts to some mortgage rates.\nBut that has not been enough to turn things around: Property investment contracted 9.1 per cent in the first nine months of 2023.\nAny liquidation may not necessarily lead to an immediate suspension of Evergrande\u2019s construction work, housing delivery and other activities.\nAfter any order, the court could appoint a liquidator, who would seize control from directors and management to make major business decisions and seek gains for creditors from existing assets.\nThat is not an easy process in dealing with Chinese developers.\nMost Evergrande projects are operated by local units, which could be hard for the offshore liquidator to seize."}
