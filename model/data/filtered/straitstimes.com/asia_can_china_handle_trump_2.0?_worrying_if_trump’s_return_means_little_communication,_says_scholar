Worrying if Trump\u2019s return means little communication, says scholar", "tags": "asia", "timestamp": "2024-09-05", "content": "Should former US president Donald Trump return to the White House, it could result in a \u201crisky\u201d lack of communication between the US and China, a visiting Chinese scholar warned on Sept 5.\nProfessor Chen Dongxiao, who heads the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, an official think-tank, was speaking at a lecture titled \u201cCan China Handle Trump 2.0?\u201d, held by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).\nTrump, who served as US president from 2017 to 2021, is running against Democrat Kamala Harris in the US presidential election in November.\nDuring the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, the US and China had almost 100 communication channels, but these were cut to zero by the end of Trump\u2019s term in office, Prof Chen noted.\nHe said Trump\u2019s advisers now have strict discipline about not communicating with Beijing \u2013 a lesson they learnt after seeing how detrimental it was when members of Trump\u2019s previous team during his first term had unauthorised contact with foreign officials.\nGeneral Mike Flynn, whom Trump named as national security adviser after the 2016 election, had a discussion on sanctions with a Russian ambassador and then lied about having that discussion. He was fired in 2017.\nProf Chen argued that Trump\u2019s team, which includes trade sceptic Robert Lighthizer, could become unrealistically confident, even complacent, and think that imposing prohibitive tariffs on China will benefit the US.\nDuring his campaign, Trump has talked about imposing a 60 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports should he win the election.\nProf Chen argued that Trump\u2019s team may be counting on tariffs to hurt China\u2019s economy more than America\u2019s, and that China cannot do anything but \u201cswallow the bitter pill\u201d.\nBut this could be just wishful thinking, he told the audience of Singapore scholars and businessmen at the event held at InterContinental Singapore.\nHe thinks this is where Singapore can come in: \u201cEven if they (Trump\u2019s team) have no interest to talk to the Chinese, they may at least talk to you.\n\u201cSingapore can convey to them that if their decisions are made in a vacuum without factoring all the possible reactions from Beijing, it will be quite risky.\u201d\nProf Chen pointed out that as a financial hub, Singapore could suffer collateral damage if the world\u2019s two largest economies were to decouple. He added that China had always appreciated the role played by Singapore\u2019s leaders, including the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in helping to reduce the perception gap between China and the US.\nIn response, Ambassador Ong Keng Yong, executive deputy chairman of RSIS, who was the moderator of the event, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Singapore, as a small country, can be persuasive in any way when the two big guys have already decided to fight.\n\u201cMaybe the only thing we can do is to hold a mirror in front of China.\u201d\nDuring his lecture, Prof Chen reiterated the importance for China and the US to communicate.\nUnder US President Joe Biden, the number of communication channels between the two sides has recovered to more than 20.\nBeijing has concluded that the US will continue to view China as its most serious challenge, as its strategic competitor, no matter who wins the November election, Prof Chen said.\nThat said, the two US presidential candidates have different leadership styles and priorities.\nHe thinks Beijing would prefer Ms Harris to Trump because a second Trump administration would be more unpredictable, unstable, destructive and more confrontational.\n\u201cPredictability is the most important from Beijing\u2019s perspective,\u201d he said.\nHe thinks Beijing would not view Trump\u2019s love for transactional deals as a plus because \u201cwe never know what may come next after one deal\u201d.\nProf Chen worries that, should Trump win, both countries\u2019 economies would further decouple.\nTrump\u2019s threat of imposing prohibitive tariffs on Chinese goods should not be regarded as a \u201cbluff\u201d or \u201cbargaining chips\u201d, he said, adding that US manufacturing investment could be pressured to exit China.\nScientific exchanges would be further curtailed, and more Chinese companies will lose access to US capital markets, he added.\nAs to how China may respond to a second Trump term, Prof Chen quoted from Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s 24-character prescription on what China must do to deal with external challenges: \u201cStay calm, remain determined, seek progress while maintaining stability.\u201d\nThis means China needs to focus on developing peacefully instead of being drawn into competition with the US, he said."}
