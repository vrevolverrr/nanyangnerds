This highlights the importance of conserving existing mangrove carbon stocks,\u201d she added. A petagram is equivalent to a billion metric tonnes.\nThe study\u2019s publication in the Science Advances journal in July comes amid a global resurgence of interest in nature restoration, including replanting mangroves, as a nature-based solution to tackle climate change.\nMangroves can store and lock carbon in the ground as they take in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. They can store three to five times more carbon compared with tropical forests.\n\u201cDespite the perceived benefit of restoration, there is now no consensus on the timeline required for successful planted mangrove stands to recover or build up levels of carbon stocks similar to natural mangrove forests,\u201d noted the research team, which involved 24 researchers from institutions such as the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry, University of Malaya and University of Cambridge.\nThis information gap prompted the researchers to embark on the study to assess whether planted mangroves demonstrate a similar ability to store carbon as natural primary stands, including mangrove forests that were free from human degradation.\nThey found that despite an increase of 25 per cent of carbon stock in soil in the first five years after planting mangroves, there was not much change thereafter as the amount stayed at about 75 per cent between five and 40 years after planting compared with existing mangrove forests.\nFor the study, the research team analysed previous studies of 684 planted mangrove stands in 24 countries, spanning 40 years of data.\nDr Bourgeois said that 77 per cent of the team\u2019s entire database was collated from countries in the Indo-Malaysian region, including Singapore, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nMangroves around the world are usually found in tropical and subtropical coastal areas because they thrive in environments with warm temperatures, high humidity and abundant rainfall throughout the year.\nGlobally, mangrove coverage shrank by 3.4 per cent between 1996 and 2020.\nThe lost coverage of 5,245 sq km is slightly smaller than the size of Brunei, according to the UN Environment Programme\u2019s biodiversity centre, which provides data analysis on global biodiversity and environmental issues.\nThe loss in mangrove coverage is about seven times the size of Singapore. It is estimated that more than 20 per cent to 35 per cent of the world\u2019s mangroves have been decimated over the past 50 years, and it is mainly due to human activities such as agriculture, aquaculture and urban development, and natural challenges such as erosion and extreme weather.\nProfessor Daniel Friess, a mangrove expert from Tulane University, who was not involved in the latest study, said the research showed that planted mangroves were still able to bring back a proportion of the carbon lost when the mangroves were removed.\n\u201cThis study provides further incentive to restore mangroves in Singapore and the region to help mitigate climate change, but nothing beats conserving what we already have and not losing it in the first place,\u201d he added.\nSingapore has experienced a significant decline in its natural mangrove forests. An estimated 85 per cent of mangroves and tidal flats and 43 per cent of seagrass meadows have been lost, mostly since 1953, according to a 2023 study conducted by Prof Friess and researchers from institutes such as NUS, NTU and Old Dominion University.\nIn the 1820s, mangroves covered 13 per cent of Singapore\u2019s land. Now, only 0.5 per cent remains, housing more than 30 mangrove species.\nGiven that Singapore has lost the majority of its mangroves, the study offers a positive outlook on the potential for restoration, said Dr Radhika Bhargava, a research fellow at NUS\u2019 department of geography.\n\u201cInvesting in bringing back the nature that does its job of reducing carbon emissions could help in bringing a more carbon-neutral economy forward... It\u2019s something that Singapore can take action on right away,\u201d she added.\nHowever, Assistant Professor Tang Hao from NUS\u2019 geography and biological sciences departments noted that planting mangroves does not necessarily guarantee a high carbon stock. This is because carbon accumulation is subject to local environmental conditions, and many plantation attempts have failed because the mangrove species were planted in an unsuitable place.\n\u201cThus, for areas with lack of space but rich in mangrove habitats, it is more efficient to invest in conservation and protection of primary mangrove forests rather than simply expanding plantations into new areas with no suitability analysis,\u201d he added."}
