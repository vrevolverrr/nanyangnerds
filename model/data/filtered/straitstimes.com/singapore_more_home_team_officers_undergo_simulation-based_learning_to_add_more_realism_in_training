But there are other types of simulation where they have already been embedded to some extent where you can wear goggles, you can carry a weapon and you\u2019re just on a carpeted floor. Because of the technology, you feel that you\u2019re in a room, that you\u2019re opening a door. So this has already begun.\u201c\nAdding sound and smell also adds realism to a simulated scenario, such as an explosion or a terror-related incident, said Dr Davies, who is also a Home Team Academy (HTA) distinguished visiting fellow.\nTactile simulation has been used by the SCDF in its fire investigation training in 2020. Trainees put on virtual reality goggles to simulate what they see when they enter a room ravaged by a fire.\nThe cost behind high-tech simulation software can vary between US$500,000 (S$678,000) and several million dollars, depending on the type of simulation-based environment required, said Dr Davies.\nShe said the military and aviation industries were the first to use simulation-based learning 20 years ago.\nSimulation-based learning is gaining popularity worldwide due to its cost and time savings, and realism. The Covid-19 pandemic and its restrictions have forced global law enforcement agencies to adapt and adopt new training regimes using simulation, said the Australia-based Dr Davies.\nThe HTA uses HTS2 to train entry-level officers to senior Home Team leaders. The simulation is also used to improve command, control and coordination in incident management.\nTrainees may go through public security incidents such as bomb blasts, chemical attacks in Housing Board estates and shootings in shopping centres, as well as prison riots, fires, checkpoints security incidents and drug raids.\nHTA chief executive Anwar Abdullah said that in a landscape of constantly evolving security challenges, simulation-based learning is indispensable in providing training for varied scenarios under conditions and environments that mirror real life.\n\u201cSimulation-based learning provides a safe environment for our officers to hone their skills and make mistakes. In particular, it gives our officers the ability to develop and exercise their decision-making skills, and hence have more confidence when faced with an actual situation,\u201d he said.\nAdding to Mr Anwar\u2019s perspective, Dr Davies said trainees must understand and learn that there are consequences to any decision they make.\nShe said: \u201cIt is all part of building the preparedness so that they know the ultimate outcome is greater safety and security for the community that they\u2019re going to serve.\u201d\nHTS2 also enhances training by drawing other law enforcement units into the same \u201coperation\u201d room.\nAdded Dr Davies: \u201cThis is still a very new approach within the policing area. The Home Team Academy has already done this quite successfully in terms of bringing in those satellite areas so that they don\u2019t need everybody all in the one place, in the one room, to conduct that simulation exercise.\u201d"}
