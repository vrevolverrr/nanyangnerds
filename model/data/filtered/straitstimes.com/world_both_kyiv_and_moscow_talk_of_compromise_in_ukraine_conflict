Moscow has said they could meet but only to finalise an agreement already hammered out.\nWhile Russia has long objected to Ukraine's Nato ambitions, Kyiv and its allies have said Moscow's true aim was to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western, elected leaders, so far thwarted by Ukraine's stiff battlefield resistance."}
