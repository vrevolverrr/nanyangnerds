Duggan, a former US Marines Corp pilot, is facing likely extradition to the United States on undisclosed charges.\nHis lawyer says Duggan denies breaching any US or Australian law. Details of the US arrest warrant and the charges he faces are sealed.\nReuters reported Duggan worked in Beijing from 2014, listing the same Beijing address as a Chinese businessman jailed in the United States for conspiring to hack US defence contractors\u2019 computers.\nAn Australian parliament hearing was told by defence officials on Wednesday it cost more than A$15 million (S$13.6 million) to train a jet fighter pilot, and any disclosure of official information by a pilot to an unauthorised person after they had left the defence force was an offence.\n\u201cForeign actors will target our people for the unique skills they have,\u201d said Ms Celia Perkins, the defence department\u2019s deputy secretary for security.
