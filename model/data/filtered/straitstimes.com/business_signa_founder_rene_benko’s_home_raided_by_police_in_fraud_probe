GIC reportedly owned \u20ac85 million (S$123 million) of the securities, according to an insolvency filing dated Dec 28.\nThe authorities in Germany and Liechtenstein are also conducting separate probes into Signa and its founder.\nAustrian prosecutors said they were looking for possible evidence that Signa Holding managers violated their duties in transactions with shares of Signa units that involved a private trust in Liechtenstein. Prosecutors also suspect embezzlement in connection with the sale of a city centre property, according to the statement.\nThe investigation also involves allegations that Benko concealed assets, including a sports car and high-value weapons, from creditors seeking payment, prosecutors said in the statement.\nSigna Holding is working closely with prosecutors and had already secured data in December, insolvency administrator Christof Stapf told Der Standard newspaper.\nSigna\u2019s insolvency has become a matter of hot debate in Austria before a general election at the end of September because of Benko\u2019s ties to the country\u2019s political elite.\nFormer chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer from Austria\u2019s Social Democratic Party was the supervisory board chair at Signa\u2019s two main property units. Mr Sebastian Kurz of the conservative People\u2019s Party helped Benko secure financing as late as 2023 after leaving politics.\nThose connections were not enough to save Signa from the impact of rising interest rates and falling property prices \u2013 or subsequent legal challenges.\nSigna\u2019s insolvency remains the focus of Austrian officials and creditors. Dr Wolfgang Peschorn, who acts as the Austrian government\u2019s legal representative, has challenged a restructuring agreement with creditors in court, saying a bankruptcy process would shed more light on the full cause and scope of the meltdown.\nAbu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment and other Middle Eastern investors are seeking more than \u20ac1 billion from Signa and Benko in arbitration.
