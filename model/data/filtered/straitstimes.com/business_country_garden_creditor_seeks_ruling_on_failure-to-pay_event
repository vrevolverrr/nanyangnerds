A 30-day grace period on the US$15.4 million (S$21 million) interest payment expired last week, and a default can be called after that.\nChina\u2019s former top builder has remained silent after saying in a statement to Bloomberg News last week that it does not expect to meet all of its offshore payments on time, citing China\u2019s home market weakness and subdued sales.\nThe company added that it hopes to seek a \u201cholistic solution\u201d to its debt problems.\nWith US$186 billion of total liabilities, Country Garden is one of the world\u2019s most indebted developers, and has come to symbolise China\u2019s broader property woes.\nCreditors are now examining whether the latest payment failure will trigger a cross-default on other debt, and when the company will deliver a restructuring blueprint.\nCountry Garden\u2019s debt now trades for pennies on the dollar. The 6.15 per cent note due in 2025 last traded for under 10 US cents, according to Trace bond pricing data. BLOOMBERG"}
