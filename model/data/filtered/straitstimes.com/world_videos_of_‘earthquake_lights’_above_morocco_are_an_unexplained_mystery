Without knowing when or where they will occur, researchers do not know where to place sensitive equipment that can detect them. Some experts doubt they are associated with earthquakes at all, according to the US Geological Survey.\nBut accounts of these lights go back centuries, Professor John Ebel, a seismologist at Boston College who wrote a book on the history of earthquakes in the north-eastern United States, said.\nResearchers, in a study in 2014, found reports of aerial luminous phenomena from 65 earthquakes occurring in Europe and the Americas during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.\nPeople have reported a variety of kinds of earthquake lights, ranging from glows high in the sky to low on the horizon. Some last up to minutes; others flash on and off like lightning. They have also been seen in different colours.\n\u201cAll of these have been reported by observers,\u201d Prof Ebel said. \u201cWhich ones are actually true, and which ones are products of their imagination, we can\u2019t really say.\u201d\nThe advent of dashcams, smartphones and social media provided the first non-anecdotal data. Videos of earthquake lights, for example, caused a stir during the Guerrero, Mexico, earthquake of 2021.\nOne hypothesis for how earthquake lights form is that the friction between tectonic plates generates electricity. But experts question that idea, because this usually results from two different materials rubbing against and pulling electric charge away from each other.\n\u201cRock on rock is not a situation where people have been able to generate large charge separation,\u201d Prof Daniels said. \u201cAnd so it just doesn\u2019t seem like a very good explanation for what people see.\u201d\nOther explanations might be electrical arcing from power lines shaken by earthquakes, Prof Daniels added.\nBut she and other experts do not rule out the possibility that there is no relationship between the lights and tectonic events.\n\u201cWe\u2019re comforted by things that we can understand, and we\u2019re scared by things we don\u2019t,\u201d Prof Daniels said. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re so fascinated by this phenomenon.\u201d NYTIMES"}
