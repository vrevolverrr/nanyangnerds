Maxwell, his lover turned close friend, was arrested the following year.\nIn a filing late on Tuesday with the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, Maxwell\u2019s lawyers argued that she was denied a fair trial and used as a scapegoat because Epstein evaded justice.\n\u201cThe government prosecuted Ms Maxwell as a proxy for Jeffrey Epstein. It did so to satisfy public outrage over an unpopular non-prosecution agreement and the death of the person responsible for the crimes,\u201d defence attorney Arthur Aidala said in a statement quoted by ABC News.\nMaxwell\u2019s lawyers argued that she was covered by a 2007 non-prosecution agreement between federal prosecutors in Florida and Epstein, which included a provision not to prosecute potential co-conspirators.\nEpstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of paying young girls for massages but served just 13 months in jail under a secret plea deal.\nMaxwell\u2019s lawyers also argued that prosecutors had waited too long to charge her and had violated the statute of limitations.\nAccording to ABC and Fox News, their filing said: \u201cIn its zeal to pin the blame for its own incompetence and for Epstein\u2019s crimes on Maxwell, the government breached its promise not to prosecute Maxwell, charged her with time-barred offences, resurrected and recast decades-old allegations for conduct previously ascribed to Epstein and other named assistants.\u201d\nThe lawyers also accused the government of joining forces with complainants\u2019 civil attorneys, whose interests were financial, to develop new allegations that would support charges against Maxwell.\u201d\nThe appeal also said trial judge Alison Nathan had wrongfully rejected a request by Maxwell in 2022 for a new trial.\nMaxwell had unsuccessfully argued that a juror, who had boasted of helping convince fellow panellists to convict her by recalling his own experiences as a sex abuse victim, had biased the jury.\nFollowing a months-long trial in New York, Maxwell was in June 2021 convicted on five of the six counts she was facing, including the most serious charge of sex-trafficking a minor."}
