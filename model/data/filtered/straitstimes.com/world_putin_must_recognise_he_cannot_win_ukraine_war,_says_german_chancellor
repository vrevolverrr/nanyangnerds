My answer, as a German and European, is: We must manage it,\" he added.\nTo better achieve this end, the global south needs a greater say in world affairs, Mr Scholz said.\nWith greater responsibility would come greater conviction, he said.\nWestern allies have been competing with Russia for diplomatic influence since the Kremlin began its invasion on Feb 24.\nMr Scholz announced that Berlin would host a conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine on Oct 25."}
