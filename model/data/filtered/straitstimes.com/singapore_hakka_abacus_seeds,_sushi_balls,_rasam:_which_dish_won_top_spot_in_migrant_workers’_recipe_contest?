The recipes were entered in a competition organised by the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE).\nOther recipes include Popo\u2019s Yam Cake, Lemper Ayam (coconut sticky rice with spiced chicken), and Rasam (South Indian soup).\nMs Suanah\u2019s employer, Ms Rebecca Yap, 31, said: \u201cWhen she came to work for me, she was rather shy and reserved. After taking part in the competition, she started to gain confidence and became more proactive.\n\u201cWe now even sit down to discuss our different cultures and how to cook cross-culture dishes.\u201d\nThe recipe that took the top spot was sushi rice balls, contributed by a helper from Myanmar, Ms Soe Thidar.\nThe acting director of Migrant Workers\u2019 Segment at the National Trades Union Congress, Mr Michael Lim, said: \u201cThe magic of food is the way it brings people together to share their different cultures, experience a taste of something familiar and comforting, and to try something new. This is what we are hoping to create with this online recipe book.\n\u201cMaking it a virtual instead of a physical book will help encourage others to come forward and have their special cross-cultural recipes included.\u201d\nThe book was launched by Minister of State for Manpower and Education Gan Siow Huang at the CDE International Migrants Day 2023 celebrations at Gardens by the Bay on Dec 10. It was attended by more than 1,000 migrant domestic workers (MDWs) from the Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar, India and Sri Lanka, some with employers in tow.\nFilipino helper Gilda Riona, 48, took part in the fun with her employer\u2019s family.\nMs Riona became the caregiver of her employer\u2019s son David, who has special needs, five years ago after the family\u2019s first domestic helper of 14 years returned home to get married.\nHer employer Clara Toh said: \u201cBefore she left, she made sure she picked a person with patience and experience to take care of my son, and she even stayed on for a month to ensure there was a proper handover.\u201d\nThey were joined by Ms Gan for a spot of lunch and festivities."}
