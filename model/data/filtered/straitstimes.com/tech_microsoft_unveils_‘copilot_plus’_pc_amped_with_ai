The result is the fastest, most AI-ready Windows PCs ever built,\u201d he added.\nOf all the tech giants, Microsoft has pushed the most aggressively to infuse the powers of generative AI into its products, often leaving rival Google to play catch-up.\nChatGPT-style AI, which is called Copilot at Microsoft, is available across the company\u2019s products, including Teams, Outlook and its Windows operating system.\nMicrosoft even tried, so far unsuccessfully, to rejuvenate Bing, its online search engine, with generative AI powers.\nThe pivot to AI has been celebrated by Wall Street, with Microsoft now the world\u2019s biggest company by market capitalization, taking the spot from Apple.\nNadella\u2019s announcement on AI comes on the heels of those made by Google and ChatGPT-maker Open AI last week.\nThe companies showcased updates to their chatbots, featuring more human-like interactions and new abilities to understand their surroundings via video, though the innovations are not yet available to users.\nGoogle also announced it was adding AI answers to its world leading search engine, despite fears it may eat into its advertising revenues.\nMicrosoft is OpenAI\u2019s main investor and has injected some $13 billion in the form of cloud computing credits that fulfill the ChatGPT-makers huge needs for computing.\n\u2018AI revolution\u2019\nAnalysts believe that the hunger for AI products is helping buoy Microsoft and Google\u2019s cloud computing businesses, with clients ready to pay a premium to adopt ChatGPT-like capabilities.\nIn a note to clients, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said that AI will add $25 billion-$30 billion to Microsoft\u2019s sales by 2025.\n\u201cThe spending on AI is unprecedented across the tech world and this is just the first phase of the AI Revolution playing out,\u201d Ives said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s injection of AI into PC\u2019s and devices comes just ahead of an Apple event next month that is widely expected to see ChatGPT\u2019s abilities feature in a new iPhone.\nMedia reports also signal that Apple could announce a partnership between Apple and OpenAI.\nThe tech giants are racing the products out the door despite worries that generative Ai poses a threat to society.\nAuthorities, including in the usually low-regulated US, are drawing up ways to more closely track the developments in AI, and potentially put limits on its deployment.
