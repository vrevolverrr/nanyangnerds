He said the probe aimed to safeguard democracy.\n\u201cIf we did not do this comprehensive correction, then what\u2019s the point of having an election in the future?\u201d he said, adding it does not aim to impeach President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi.\nHuge win\nParliament reconvenes in March and for a probe to be launched, it must be approved by more than half of legislators present at a plenary session.\nMr Prabowo looks to have swept the Feb 14 election with almost 60 per cent of the votes, boosted by the tacit backing of Mr Widodo, who has faced mounting allegations of ethical breaches and meddling, which his allies deny.\nMr Prabowo also ran on a ticket with Mr Widodo\u2019s son, owing to a last-minute decision by the Constitutional Court, headed by the President\u2019s brother-in-law, to change election eligibility rules.\nPDI-P\u2019s plan is backed by another pro-Ganjar party and has the support of three parties that endorsed second-place finisher, Mr Anies Baswedan. If combined, those constitute a majority, with 314 of 575 seats.\nIn a report on Indonesia\u2019s election last week, poll monitor Asian Network for Free Elections noted widespread concerns about the independence of the election commission and mobilisation, and misuse of state resources to sway voter preferences, adding \u201cit would be of a disservice to the electoral stakeholders\u201d if those were to go unaddressed.\nMr Hermawi Taslim, a top official of NasDem, which backed Mr Anies, said his party supported PDI-P\u2019s plan.\n\u201cThe probe is needed so the upcoming government is legitimate,\u201d he added.
