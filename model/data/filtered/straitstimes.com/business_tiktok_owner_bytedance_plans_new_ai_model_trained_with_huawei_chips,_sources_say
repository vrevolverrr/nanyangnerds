No new model is being developed.\u201d\nHuawei did not reply to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.\nByteDance has ordered more than 100,000 Ascend 910B chips in 2024 but has received fewer than 30,000 as at July, a pace too slow to meet company needs, one of the people said.\nThe constrained supply and limited computing power versus Nvidia\u2019s China-available chips have prevented ByteDance from setting a timeline for the new model, two of the people said.\nByteDance\u2019s current AI technology is used in its flagship large-language model launched in August 2023 and rebranded as chatbot Doubao, and in many other applications, including text-to-video tool Jimeng. It introduced two video-focused Doubao models in September to compete with OpenAI.\nUse of such applications has ballooned since early 2024, with ByteDance\u2019s chatbot becoming one of China\u2019s most popular apps with more than 10 million monthly active users.\nThe increased emphasis on AI has made ByteDance one of the largest buyers of Huawei\u2019s AI chips, the three people said.\nIt is also the biggest buyer of Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI chip, which the US chipmaker tailored for the China market in response to trade restrictions, said two of the people. The TikTok owner is also Microsoft\u2019s biggest client in Asia for Nvidia chips accessible via cloud computing, said two separate sources.\nReuters previously reported that ByteDance allocated US$2 billion (S$2.56 billion) for Nvidia chips in 2023.
