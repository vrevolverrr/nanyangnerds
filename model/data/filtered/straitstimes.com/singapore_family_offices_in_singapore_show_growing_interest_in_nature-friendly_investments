It supports initiatives that aim to improve the health of the oceans, such as seaweed farming and plant-based proteins, among other sustainability-linked investments.\n\u201cAs the natural world crumbles around us, family offices have the aptitude to recognise long-term threats and opportunities, and have the opportunity to play a pivotal role in catalysing funding for much-needed work to repair our planet home,\u201d said Rumah Group director Kathlyn Tan, 36. \u201cAnd as financial sustainability and environmental sustainability increasingly align, those who act early stand to reap higher rewards.\u201d\nThe financing of nature was a key focus on the second day of Ecosperity Week, held at Marina Bay Sands from April 15 to 17.\nA report on South-east Asia\u2019s green economy, published on April 15 by Bain & Company, GenZero, Standard Chartered and Temasek, identified nature as a sector in the region where there are opportunities to cut emissions, protect ecosystems and generate revenues. For example, investments in sustainable rice cultivation could cut water use and emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\nMs Kyung-Ah Park, Temasek\u2019s head of environmental, social and governance investment management and managing director for sustainability, said nature can help in humanity\u2019s bid to tackle climate change, but that it is declining at unprecedented rates.\n\u201cAsia is among the most at-risk regions, with 63 per cent of its GDP at risk from nature loss, but it is also where the opportunity is,\u201d she said. \u201c(At Ecosperity), we aim to rally stakeholders for action, and catalyse the systems-level change we need to realise a thriving, sustainable world for current and future generations.\u201d\nMr Lee Woon Shiu, group head of wealth planning, family office and insurance solutions at DBS Private Bank, said that with a new generation of family members taking over the reins of their familial wealth, there is growing interest among this group to see how their capital can be channelled into more impactful investments with social or environmental benefits.\nAs many of such investments are in private markets, it is challenging to identify trends or glean concrete figures on the number of family offices expressing interest in such fields, said Mr Lee. But anecdotally, the bank has seen \u201cstrong interest\u201d among the next generation of family office leaders in environmental causes, he added.\nFor example, DBS Foundation \u2013 which supports businesses that help or make an impact on vulnerable communities \u2013 had supported social enterprise Phool from India, which collects floral waste from the Ganges River to create a sustainable alternative to leather, dubbed Fleather.\nThis material was featured during Paris Fashion Week, Mr Lee said, and it won a strong following among some of the family offices managed by the bank. \u201cThe massive opportunities created by investments into such sustainable investments are drawing more family offices to review and step up their support in this regard,\u201d he added.\nSilverstrand\u2019s Mr Chiu agreed, saying: \u201cIn South-east Asia, there is growing momentum in impact investing with the emergence of more first-generation family offices, driven by younger, entrepreneurial founders who embrace the concept of profit with purpose.\u201d\nImpact investments are the most effective way to create long-lasting, positive change at scale, he noted. \u201cWe believe that for the impact to be enduring, the solution must also be financially self-sustaining,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a new generation of impact entrepreneurs looking to do good and do well, and it is up to us as investors to support them in their journey.\u201d\nProfit-with-purpose philosophy aside, Mr Lee from DBS said research has shown that over the longer term, stocks with strong environmental, social and governance scores outperformed the larger benchmark index.\nMoreover, as national policies evolve in favour of greater disclosure of climate and nature-related risks and opportunities, with greater clarity on what sustainable financing entails, the trend of an increasing interest in sustainable investments looks set to continue, he added.\nAsked if such investments made by family offices will have cascading effects on the economy, Mr Lee said their investments have a longer-term strategic impact.\n\u201cThe many ultra-high-net-worth families we have spoken to have shared with us that capital will make the most impact if there is a network in place to make connections,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe choice of Singapore as a preferred hotbed for partnerships and collaboration will create continuous... inflows of deep talent and new investors or family offices who would choose Singapore as their hub, which will, in turn, translate into sustained growth in new pockets within the financial and associated support sectors in Singapore.\u201d"}
