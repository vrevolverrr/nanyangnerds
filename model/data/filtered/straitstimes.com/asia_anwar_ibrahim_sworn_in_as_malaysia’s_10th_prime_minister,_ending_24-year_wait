I will carry out this solemn duty with my team guided by the will and desire of the people,\u201d Mr Anwar said in a tweet after he was sworn in.\nThis comes after most parties agreed to Sultan Abdullah\u2019s proposal for a unity government after Saturday\u2019s general election resulted in Malaysia\u2019s first ever hung Parliament.\nParti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) president Anwar and his PN rival Muhyiddin, also 75, had been deadlocked and unable to gather the 112 MPs needed for a simple majority in the legislature.\nAfter Umno confirmed early on Thursday that it would join a unity government, departing from the BN coalition\u2019s earlier stance of remaining in opposition, other parties across the country followed suit.\nEven PN said on Thursday that it would consider unity government discussions with like-minded parties.\nMarkets surged upon the end of the political deadlock. The ringgit currency posted its best day in two weeks and equities rose 3 per cent, hitting a 15-month high.\nMr Anwar\u2019s appointment was met with cheers from his allies and supporters.\nIn her Instagram post, Mr Anwar\u2019s daughter Nurul Izzah, who saw her father sacked and jailed in 1998 after a fallout with then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, said: \u201cI love you papa and I am always proud of you, even as you lay imprisoned as a prisoner of conscience.\u201d\nMr Rafizi Ramli, the deputy president of Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), a component party of PH, thanked the King for appointing Mr Anwar as the new premier.\n\u201cWe must all move forward and learn to cooperate to rebuild Malaysia for the sake of its future, and the prosperity of the people of different groups, races, states and backgrounds,\u201d the Pandan MP said in a statement.\nThe Straits Times has learnt that a deal struck between PH and BN \u2013 which found itself in the role of kingmaker with 30 MPs despite the Umno-led coalition being humiliated at Saturday\u2019s vote \u2013 will see Umno gaining several senior portfolios, with the party\u2019s No. 2 Mohamad Hasan set to be installed as deputy premier.\nMr Anwar\u2019s ascension to the top office, having been sacked as deputy premier in 1998 amid controversial allegations of sodomy and abuse of power, marks a remarkable triumph following a journey that included two stints in prison.\nHe was appointed deputy prime minister under Tun Dr Mahathir\u2019s Umno-led government in 1993, but his prospects dimmed after he was jailed for corruption in 1999. His imprisonment sparked street protests and the birth of his PKR, which now leads PH.\nMr Anwar was again imprisoned in 2015 for sodomy, but was given a royal pardon and released in May 2018 after PH won the general election that year. Dr Mahathir, who had left Umno and joined hands with Mr Anwar to secure PH\u2019s victory, became the prime minister.\nThe PKR chief was then widely expected to ascend to power as part of an agreement within PH for him to take over as prime minister in two years from Dr Mahathir. But his progress was again thwarted when the PH government collapsed in February 2020 following defections.\nMr Anwar and Tan Sri Muhyiddin both staked their claim after their respective coalitions won 81 and 73 seats, respectively, in Saturday\u2019s general election, which also saw Dr Mahathir fall from grace in a thumping defeat.\nSultan Abdullah stepped in on Tuesday to surface the idea of a unity government.\nMr Muhyiddin\u2019s decision to reject the proposal, claiming he had a simple majority with backing from other parties, proved fatal to his hopes."}
