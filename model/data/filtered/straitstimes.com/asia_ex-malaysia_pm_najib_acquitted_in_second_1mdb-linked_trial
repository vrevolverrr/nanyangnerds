Until Friday, he had not won any legal battles over the 42 1MDB charges that have been levelled against him.\nJustice Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, who has been elevated to the Court of Appeal since the audit tampering trial started, said on Friday that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against Najib and Mr Arul Kanda.\nThe trial on audit tampering is one of three that Najib is currently facing in Malaysian courts in relation to the scandal surrounding 1MDB \u2013 a sovereign wealth fund he founded, which later went on to lose billions in taxpayers\u2019 money.\nIn 2022, he was convicted and imprisoned by Malaysia\u2019s highest court, the Federal Court, in the first of the trials \u2013 on graft charges involving RM42 million (S$12.6 million) from former 1MDB subsidiary SRC International.\nA third trial, involving RM2.28 billion in 1MDB monies, is being heard in the High Court, and is at the prosecution stage, while another criminal breach of trust charge involving RM6.6 billion has yet to go to a full trial.\nThe audit tampering charges carry a maximum prison term of 20 years, and it remains unclear if the prosecution will be appealing against the acquittal.\nNajib\u2019s wife Rosmah Mansor, who has also been convicted of corruption and is out on bail pending appeal, told reporters outside the High Court that the verdict is a \u201cwin\u201d for the family.\nNajib is one of several high-profile leaders from Umno \u2013 the country\u2019s longest-ruling party \u2013 who have faced graft charges in the courts since the party lost federal power for the first time in its history in 2018.\nDeputy Prime Minister Zahid Hamidi \u2013 a Najib ally \u2013 is also facing multiple graft charges, although he was similarly acquitted without being called to defend himself in the first of the trials in 2022.\nThe High Court on Friday also issued a certificate of indemnity for Mr Arul Kanda following his acquittal.\nHe turned into a prosecution witness over the course of the trial, and Justice Zaini said no further civil or criminal case can be brought against Mr Arul Kanda in relation to the audit tampering case in the future, as he had been \u201ctruthful\u201d throughout the proceedings in the case.\nThe certificate of indemnity likely means that Mr Arul Kanda will not be standing in the dock alongside Najib should prosecutors decide to appeal against Friday\u2019s acquittal."}
