It added that it had agreed to pay the fine without admitting or denying the findings.\nThe company regards full adherence to the regulatory requirements in all the jurisdictions where it operates as a core principle of its business, it added.\nOlam, then Olam International, agreed to pay US$3 million to settle a complaint levelled by the CFTC in January 2015, The Edge Singapore reported.\nThat settlement came without an admission or denial of the complaint as well, the paper said.\nOlam Group, among the world\u2019s biggest agricultural commodity traders, posted a net profit of $48.03 million for the six months ended June 30, compared with $47.96 million in 2023.\nEarlier in September, its indirectly owned subsidiary Olam Agri increased its takeover bid for Namoi Cotton, just two days after independent directors at the Australian cotton producer recommended a rival offer from Louis Dreyfus Company.\nShares of Olam closed unchanged at $1.13 on Sept 27.
