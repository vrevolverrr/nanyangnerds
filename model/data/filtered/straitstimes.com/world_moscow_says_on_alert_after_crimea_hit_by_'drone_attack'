We have three settlements left on the Kinburn Split to officially no longer be a region at war,\u201d said Mykolaiv regional governor Vitaly Kim on social media.\nThe southern split jutting into the Black Sea is divided in two: in the west, as part of the Mykolaiv region and to the east as part of the Kherson region.\nIt is cut off from territory controlled by Ukraine\u2019s forces by the Dnipro river, which flows through the Kherson region.\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the European Union in an online media conference that its support was crucial, warning against \u201cfatigue\u201d towards the war.\n\u201cIf we Ukrainians are not tired, the rest of Europe has neither moral nor political right to be tired,\u201d he said.\nMr Kuleba called on the EU to implement a fresh round of sanctions against Russia, urging particular attention to measures that slow down and stop Russia\u2019s missile industry.\n\u201cI call on my colleagues in the EU...to put aside any doubts or, as the fashionable phrase goes, \u2018fatigue\u2019 and to start and quickly conclude the ninth sanctions package,\u201d he said.\nThe US government said on Tuesday it would provide another US$4.5 billion (S$6.2 billion) in financial backing for \u201csupporting core government services\u201d.\nAs much of Ukraine\u2019s energy grid is pounded by Russian strikes, the World Bank has warned that the country faces severe energy supply disruption amid frigid weather.\n\u201cThe Kremlin wants to transform the cold this winter into a weapon of mass destruction,\u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told a meeting of French mayors in a video message.\nMeanwhile, Russian energy giant Gazprom accused Ukraine of diverting natural gas supplies transiting to Moldova, and threatened to curtail deliveries through a key pipeline to Europe in response.\nThe allegations marked the latest point of tension over energy deliveries between Kyiv, European capitals and Moscow \u2013 which has reduced consignments to Europe in response to Western sanctions over the conflict.\nUkraine denied the allegations, saying that all the gas bound for Moldovan consumers had been transferred in full.
