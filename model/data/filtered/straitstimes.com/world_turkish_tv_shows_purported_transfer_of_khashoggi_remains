The murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of 33-year-old prince, the kingdom's de facto leader.\nSabah said the cases had been brought to the residence in a black minibus at 3.09pm (1209 GMT).\nAfter offering numerous contradictory explanations regarding the fate of Khashoggi, Riyadh later said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.\nKhashoggi's remains have not been found and Turkey has repeatedly asked Saudi Arabia where they are. Last month, Turkish police searched a remote villa in a coastal area southeast of Istanbul as part of the investigation.\nSaudi Arabia's public prosecutor's office said last month it is seeking the death penalty for five individuals, and that 11 of 21 suspects have been indicted and will be referred to court in Saudi Arabia.\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week Ankara was working with other countries to take the investigation into Khashoggi's killing to the United Nations."}
