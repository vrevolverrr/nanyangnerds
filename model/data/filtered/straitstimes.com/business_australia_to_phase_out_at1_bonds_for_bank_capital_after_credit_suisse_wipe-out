The banking regulator began examining the securities known as additional tier 1 bonds in September 2023.\nA legacy of the global financial crisis, AT1s are the lowest rung of bank debt, producing healthy returns in good times but taking a hit when a bank runs into trouble. In March 2023, about US$17 billion (S$22 billion) of the securities were completely written off when UBS Group rescued Credit Suisse.\nThe bailout was brokered by the Swiss government and helped to shore up confidence in the global financial system at a time when US regional lenders were in crisis. But it also triggered legal action by investors left out of pocket in countries from Switzerland to Japan.\nThe proposed changes \u201cdraw on the lessons of last year\u2019s global banking turmoil where several US and European banks either failed or needed to be resolved in short succession, with a number of governments having to intervene to minimise the risk of contagion and financial system instability\u201d, Apra said.\nApra chair John Lonsdale said AT1 bonds do not fulfil the function of stabilising a bank during times of crisis due to the complexity of the securities, the potential for legal challenges and the risk of contagion. In Australia, those risks are heightened because an \u201cunusually high proportion\u201d of the notes are held by retail investors, he said.\nAustralia\u2019s big four banks each hold AT1 bonds equal to at least 1.5 per cent of their risk-weighted assets. Under the proposal, they will be able to replace those bonds with 1.25 per cent tier 2 capital and 0.25 per cent common equity tier 1 capital. Smaller lenders would be able to fully replace AT1 with tier 2 instruments.\nImplementation of the framework would likely lead to a \u201crelatively low\u201d increase in funding costs for so-called advanced banks, Apra said. It estimated an A$70 million (S$60.8 million) impact as a base case.\nShares of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking, National Australia Bank and ANZ Group Holdings all rose more than 1 per cent on the morning of Sept 10. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index climbed 0.8 per cent. BLOOMBERG"}
