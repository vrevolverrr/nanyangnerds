It recently signed a deal to explore potential investments in Indonesia while also considering building EV plants in neighbouring Philippines or Vietnam.\nMeanwhile, Tesla has had to cut prices to stoke demand in Asia, even after earlier markdowns took a toll on profitability. Blue Bird is still reviewing its orders for Tesla based on the return on investment.\nBlue Bird will also buy 50 Hyundai EV units in 2023 while considering BMW EV models to meet rental demand.\nCombustion engines will still make up the bulk of Blue Bird\u2019s fleet, with plans to reach around 23,000 cars overall by year end.\nBlue Bird will also triple its fleet of cars that run on compressed natural gas to as many as 6,000 in 2023, as EVs and CNG vehicles lower its operational cost.
