Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to address the United Nations General Assembly on Sept 27.\nThe latest bloodshed in the decades old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct 7 when Palestinian Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 41,000, according to Palestinian health authorities. REUTERS"}
