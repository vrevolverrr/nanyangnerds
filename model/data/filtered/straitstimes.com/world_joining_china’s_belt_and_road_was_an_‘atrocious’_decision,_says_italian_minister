Mr Crosetto is part of an administration that is considering how to break free of the agreement.\nThe BRI scheme envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with large infrastructure spending. Critics see it as a tool for China to spread its geopolitical and economic influence.\n\u201cThe decision to join the (new) Silk Road was an improvised and atrocious act\u201d that multiplied China\u2019s exports to Italy but did not have the same effect on Italian exports to China, Mr Crosetto told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.\n\u201cThe issue today is: How to walk back (from the BRI) without damaging relations (with Beijing). Because it is true that China is a competitor, but it is also a partner,\u201d the minister added.\nAfter a White House meeting with United States President Joe Biden on Thursday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her government had until December to make a decision on the BRI. She also announced that she would soon travel to Beijing.\nIn an interview on Saturday with the TG5 Italian news programme, Ms Meloni said it was a \u201cparadox\u201d that even if Italy is part of the BRI, it is not the Group of Seven country with the strongest trading links with China.\n\u201cThis shows that you can have good relations and trading partnerships\u201d even outside of the BRI, she added.
