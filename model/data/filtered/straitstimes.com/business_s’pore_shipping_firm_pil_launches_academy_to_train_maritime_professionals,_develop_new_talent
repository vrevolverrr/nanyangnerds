They will also conduct continuing education and training programmes and workplace learning projects.\nThe academy has also teamed up with skills management software company JobKred to facilitate technology-based learning for PIL employees.\nAnother initiative will see the academy offer maritime diplomas to PIL employees via a partnership with the Britain-based Maritime Training Academy.\nTransport Minister Chee Hong Tat told the academy\u2019s launch event at Guoco Midtown on June 7 that the maritime industry is key to international trade, with more than 80 per cent of the world\u2019s cargo transported by sea.\nHe said Singapore aims to be a global hub for maritime talent development, leveraging the strong tripartite partnership between the Government, industry and unions.\n\u201cAs the global maritime industry embraces new challenges such as digitalisation and decarbonisation, Maritime Singapore must continue to upskill and reskill our workforce so that workers can remain relevant and competitive,\u201d said Mr Chee.\nMr Chee added that PIL\u2019s approach to training will help to attract and retain talent within the firm and in the overall maritime sector.\n\u201cWe hope what PIL is doing can serve as a good role model for other companies to also use this tripartite arrangement and stackable micro-credential learning modules to upgrade their employees,\u201d he said.\nPIL employees at the event told The Straits Times that the academy will provide a more targeted approach to maritime training.\nMs Lai Sok Kuan, a senior manager who has been at the firm for a decade, said there is little specialised training in the maritime industry: \u201cThere are a lot of external courses that we went for, but they are all generic and don\u2019t cater directly to our company.\n\u201cFor example, ship sizes vary from small to large, but PIL only has small to medium-sized ships, and each ship has its own technical specification... For in-house training like PIL Academy, we can tap our own experts to guide us directly.\u201d\nMr Ahmad Dzul Danial, a new hire who is enrolled in the firm\u2019s Management Associate Programme, said that PIL Academy will equip employees with better knowledge and expertise.\n\u201c(It) will enable us to learn more about the entire maritime company, but it\u2019s also specialised in the sense that it\u2019ll help us understand the company\u2019s internal operations and needs.\u201d"}
