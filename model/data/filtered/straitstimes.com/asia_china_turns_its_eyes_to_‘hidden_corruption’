It could also refer to the business activities of current and former officials.\nThere are also signs that Beijing is now training its sights on this \u201ccollusion between such officials and business people\u201d, said political analyst Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nOn Monday, CCDI deputy director Xiao Pei wrote in the official People\u2019s Daily that Beijing would soon enact a law to restrict the business activities of current and former officials.\nIt would \u201cclarify management mechanisms such as recusal of civil servants, and restrictions on part-time work, commercial dealings, and employment after they leave their jobs\u201d, said Mr Xiao.\nDr Lam pointed out that China at the moment does not have comprehensive laws to govern civil servants\u2019 dealings in the private sector.\n\u201cThis could also be a so-called \u2018new\u2019 form of corruption that they are tackling,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSince the beginning of economic reforms and the open door policy in the 80s, there were people who retired from the civil service or party bureaucracy and gone into business taking advantage of their connections, but relatively few officials have been prosecuted.\u201d\nUnlike 2022, the readout of 2023\u2019s CCDI meeting did not mention that the anti-graft agency will crack down on the \u201cdisorderly expansion of capital and platform monopolies\u201d, which experts say is a clear sign that Beijing is shifting its focus away from private firms and tech giants."}
