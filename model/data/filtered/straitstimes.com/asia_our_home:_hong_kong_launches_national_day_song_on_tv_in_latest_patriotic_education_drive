No matter how far or how tough the journey, we are never afraid,\u201d goes the refrain sung by Kwong, 62, a former beauty queen and popular Cantopop singer from the 1980s and 1990s.\nKwong \u2013 also known as Kuang Meiyun \u2013 performed the song alongside a student choir at the West Kowloon Cultural District on the eve of China\u2019s national day on Sept 30.\nKaraoke versions of the song, first released in September, will be distributed to primary and secondary school students across Hong Kong in October, the working group said.\nOur Home appears to be Hong Kong\u2019s first pop song written specifically for national education purposes.\nThere have been other pop songs related to the same theme, such as late singer Roman Tam\u2019s Chinese Dreams in the 1980s, but they were not produced specifically for any campaign, according to the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Professor Stephen Chu.\n\u201cThe use of a pop song (for Our Home) seems aimed at attracting wider public attention, especially that of the younger generation,\u201d Prof Chu, who teaches Hong Kong culture, film and music, told The Straits Times.\nBut while the song is easy on the ears and has references to the Lion Rock Spirit in the lyrics and visuals, \u201cthe \u2018top-down\u2019 approach is not usually very effective\u201d, he said.\n\u201cSociety has changed so much that I\u2019m not sure if the style and the spirit still appeal to the general public, let alone the younger generation.\u201d\nHowever, it will be a long-term effort to nurture a sense of belonging to the motherland among Hong Kong people, many of whom still find the compulsory singing of the national anthem at local schools a foreign concept.\nIt became mandatory in 2022 for all public schools in Hong Kong to hold a flag-raising ceremony with the singing of the national anthem once a week. But the move \u2013 while implemented \u2013 was met with contention, with the media reporting at that time that many residents viewed it as a form of indoctrination.\nProfessor Anthony Cheung, a former official who is now a research chair professor of public administration at the Education University of Hong Kong, said while national education is \u201cnormal and necessary in any country\u201d, the notion has for decades been marked by ambiguity in Hong Kong due to its \u201cunique historical legacy\u201d.\nHong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997 under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that promises the city a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not typically enjoyed elsewhere in China.\n\u201cAs we move into the future, patriotism and national education should be normalised...\n\u201cOne should not need to feel either that patriotism is something negative and uncalled for by default, nor should one feel constantly under pressure to prove that we are patriotic all the time,\u201d Prof Cheung told ST.\n\u201cWe should do away with this kind of baggage. We can be proud of our country and also be critical of it when we have not done things well enough.\u201d"}
