Meet Singapore\u2019s robotic workforce", "tags": "tech", "timestamp": "2023-02-14", "content": "SINGAPORE - They are the Republic\u2019s robotic workforce and plugged labour gaps during the Covid-19 pandemic, easing people\u2019s workload.\nDozens of these robots made an appearance at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) during a robotics festival to celebrate the National Robotics Programme\u2019s sixth anniversary on Friday.\nThe Straits Times looks at 10 outstanding robots \u2013 some familiar and frequently seen, others to make their debut soon.\nA friendly face\nWith expressive blue eyes that resemble Eve\u2019s from the Pixar sci-fi animation film Wall-E, the LeoBot has become a familiar sight here, keeping Changi Airport\u2019s walkways and the Esplanade clean.\nLaunched in 2019 by home-grown robotics firm Lionsbot, the LeoBot comes in several models that can quietly clean floors and lug up to 450kg of cargo around.\nLionsbot\u2019s latest cleaning robot, the R3 Scrub, is smaller and can map its surroundings instead of simply navigating by using pre-installed maps.\nSingapore\u2019s RoboCop\nWhile it is no gun-slinging cyborg, this bot developed by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research\u2019s (A*Star), Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) and the police, does plenty to keep the streets safe. The Multi-purpose All-Terrain Autonomous Robot \u2013 or Matar \u2013 roams public areas to provide a 360-degree view to the police, as well as broadcasts messages to the public through in-built speakers.\nRobot nurse\nThe Temi-Bot helped plug the gap in community treatment facilities at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, when there was a shortage of healthcare workers to look after patients down with the virus.\nThis roving bot by a United States-based firm wheels over to each patient to deliver medicines and link them up with doctors for a virtual consultation on its large screen.\nRobot dogs\nThey fetch items and scurry where no human would dare to enter without any complaints. These robotic canines can replace people in conducting patrols and delivering goods to areas such as tunnels or disaster zones.\nThe latest model developed by local robotics firm Weston Robot is able to carry payloads of up to 40kg and last roughly 2.4 hours per charge. A similar robot originally built by Boston Dynamics was seen reminding visitors of safe distancing measures in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in 2020.\nMozzie killer\nThe Dragonfly is a menacing mozzie exterminator \u2013 a mosquito trap on wheels. Seen in public areas with potential breeding grounds like Gardens by the Bay, the Swiss Club area and the National University of Singapore, the robot secretes the smell of human sweat and shines an ultraviolet light to attract mosquitoes.\nOnce they approach, a small fan sucks the mosquitoes in, trapping them on a replaceable sticky film housed within the bot, which was developed by SUTD.\nShapeshifter\nThis caterpillar-like bot can change its shape depending on its task. Its four sections can line up like a train if it needs to squeeze into narrow areas for tasks such as cleaning, or roll into a block to cover a greater surface area.\nThe Smorphi is developed by SUTD and is being tested for various functions by robotics firms including Lionsbot.\nBot\u2019s got your back\nMany workers in factories and industrial sites develop back injuries from lifting heavy objects. To the rescue comes a mechanised exoskeleton that gives its wearer a boost when carrying objects, protecting his spine.\nThe machines make the items feel half as heavy and can go a long way to reducing workplace injuries, said the exoskeleton\u2019s developers from the National University of Singapore.\nMaple seed drone\nMost drones come with four motors that power the propellers to keep the devices airborne, but SUTD developers have found a new way to drastically cut the number of parts needed to build a drone.\nTheir drone is inspired by the aerodynamics of a maple seed and is powered by a single motorised rotor attached to one end, keeping the whole device hovering level in the air. The concept for the Single Actuator Monocopter can be developed for various uses in the field, including surveillance.\nHigh-altitude cleaning\nThis coffee-table-sized drone can be seen zipping around the Supertrees of Gardens by the Bay, hosing the branches down with water to keep the structure clean.\nThe multi-purpose drone, developed by SUTD and local firm Spinoff Robotics, hovers into areas too dangerous or tricky for humans to access, and can be programmed for cleaning or inspection.\nA human touch\nWould you trust a robot claw to grab an egg without cracking it? Home-grown start-up Tacniq\u2019s sensors enable robot arms to gently touch an item to get a sense of how sturdy it is, much like a human approaches delicate items with caution.\nThe sensors could allow automated bots in packing facilities to handle different items on the same factory line without fear of them being damaged."}
