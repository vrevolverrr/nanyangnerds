Some officials see the aim as unrealistic.\nWhen asked on Sept 26 by a reporter if Ukraine should hand over some of the Ukrainian land Russia has captured to end the war \u2013 a non-starter for Kyiv \u2013 Trump replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nAt one point during a pre-meeting press conference on Sept 27, when Mr Zelensky suggested he had a better relationship with Trump than President Putin did, Trump responded: \u201cYeah, but you know it takes two to tango.\u201d\nStill, Trump said on Sept 27 he was pleased to meet Mr Zelensky, a marked change in tone from some of his previous comments on the campaign trail. After the meeting, Mr Zelensky called his talks with Trump \u201cvery productive\u201d.\nOn Sept 23, Trump said Mr Zelensky wanted Ms Harris to win the election.\nHe has also called Mr Zelensky \u201cthe greatest salesman of all time\u201d because his country has received billions of dollars in military aid from the US and Europe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to have the President with us, and he\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d Trump said on Sept 27.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been through a tremendous amount, like probably nobody else, almost nobody else in history, if you really get right down to it, and we\u2019re going to have a discussion and see what we could come up with.\u201d\nTrump, Harris differ on Ukraine\nTrump on Sept 27 said that if he won the Nov 5 election he would immediately begin working towards a resolution of the Ukraine conflict, even though he would formally take office only in late January 2025.\nMr Zelensky, who was in the US for the United Nations General Assembly, met President Joe Biden and Ms Harris on Sept 26.\nOver the weekend, Mr Zelensky travelled to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania with that state\u2019s Democratic Governor, Mr Josh Shapiro, a Harris ally.\nThe visit upset Trump\u2019s campaign and enraged some congressional Republicans who viewed the trip as a campaign stop, particularly as Pennsylvania is an important battleground state expected to decide the US election.\nAs late as Sept 26, people close to Trump and his campaign had said a meeting appeared extremely unlikely, though the former president apparently changed his mind during Mr Zelensky\u2019s stay in the country.\nTrump and Ms Harris\u2019 differences on Ukraine echo splits in their respective Democratic and Republican parties, and their view of the US role in the world.\nAlong with Trump, some Republicans in Congress have questioned the value of US funding and additional weapons for Ukraine\u2019s two-year battle against Russia\u2019s invasion, calling it futile, while Democrats led by Mr Biden have pushed to punish Russia and bolster Ukraine, framing Ukraine\u2019s victory as a vital national security interest.\nThe war in Ukraine and foreign policy in general lag behind domestic issues like the economy, healthcare and immigration in terms of what most voters think are important.\nBut a strong majority, 64 per cent, of registered voters say they support Ukraine\u2019s use of US-supplied arms to strike within Russia, according to an August Reuters/Ipsos poll, including 78 per cent of Democrats and 56 per cent of Republicans.
