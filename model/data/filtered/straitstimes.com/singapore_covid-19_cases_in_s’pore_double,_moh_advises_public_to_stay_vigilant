The global health body also noted that the increasing trend is not unexpected because of the onset of winter.\nMOH advised the public to keep up to date with their Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\u201cAn additional dose at around one year after their last vaccine dose is recommended for those aged 60 years and above, medically vulnerable persons, and residents of aged-care facilities,\u201d said the ministry."}
