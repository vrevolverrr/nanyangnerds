Global demand for new energy cars will be 45 million to 75 million units by then, far exceeding the world\u2019s current supply capacity, he added, citing estimates by the International Energy Agency.\nMr Liao spoke to Bloomberg News on July 26, a day after Dr Yellen vowed to \u201ckeep pressing China to address its macroeconomic model\u201d, which she said is channelling \u201ctoo much\u201d savings and subsidies into manufacturing and contributing to the overcapacity.\nChina is facing rising trade barriers in developed economies such as the United States and the European Union, which have been complaining about the excess output and its impact on their industrial sectors and companies.\nThe EU is moving forward with tariffs on Chinese electric cars, while Donald Trump has threatened to impose duties of 50 per cent or more on imports of Chinese goods if he wins November\u2019s presidential election.\nSome developing nations including Brazil and Turkey have also placed tariffs on Chinese products including steel and cars, though they have been less vocal in criticising Beijing\u2019s industrial policy.\nWhile China pays attention to concerns of major economies about overcapacity, it, too, is concerned about trade threats such as tariffs, Mr Liao said.\n\u201cWe should communicate in a candid manner with respect to rules of market economy and true facts,\u201d he said, adding that China and the US will continue to discuss the issue at the China-US Economic Working Group meetings.\nMr Liao was a key member of China\u2019s team of trade-war negotiators facing off against US officials during Trump\u2019s presidency. He travelled to the US as an aide to then Vice-Premier Liu He and met Trump in the Oval Office. More recently, Mr Liao greeted Dr Yellen when she visited the country in April.\nGovernment subsidies are not the main reason that Chinese industries such as the renewable energy sector have gained competitive advantages over their peers, Mr Liao said. More important factors are corporate investment in research and development spanning years, entrepreneurship and technological innovation, he said.\n\u201cChina\u2019s reform and opening-up experience over the past more than 40 years has told us not a single industry can become a globally competitive sector simply relying on government support,\u201d he said.\nHe also argued that some countries were left behind in terms of developing electric vehicles (EVs) because they enjoy advantages in the conventional auto sector and therefore did not shift their focus to the emerging industry. In contrast, China had to seek growth in new sectors such as EVs due to a lack of advantages in the traditional car market.\nDemand-supply disequilibrium is only natural for any market economy, partly because companies make their own investment decisions, and they do so for the long run, expecting to meet higher demand, Mr Liao said. Market forces will show if they made the right or wrong decisions, he said.\nLarge flows of capital funds into new industries are also not rare, he said, citing previous investment frenzies into sectors such as information technology, shale gas and biopharmaceuticals that resulted in \u201cperiodical\u201d excess capacity in developed countries.
