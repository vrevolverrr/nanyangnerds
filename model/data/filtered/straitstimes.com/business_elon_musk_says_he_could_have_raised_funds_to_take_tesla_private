Funding secured.\u201d\nHe then wrote: \u201cInvestor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it\u2019s contingent on a shareholder vote.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s share price jumped after those posts, but later fell as the proposal fizzled out.\nHow jurors interpret Mr Musk\u2019s statements and the effect these had on investors could be critical to the outcome of this case. A victory for investors could mean Mr Musk and Tesla would have to pay billions of dollars in damages.\nMr Musk has testified for about four hours in this trial and was due back on the stand on Tuesday. He answered Monday\u2019s questions about the Saudi fund, called the Public Investment Fund, from a plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer. Mr Musk said officials from the Saudi fund had not signed documents committing to a deal or discussed how much they would invest.\nMr Musk had long claimed that Saudi investors were committed to the transaction.\nHe testified that \u201cfunding secured\u201d referred not just to financing from the Saudi fund but also to his stake in SpaceX, a rocket company where he is also CEO. Mr Musk could theoretically have borrowed against his stake in SpaceX or sold some of that stock to come up with the money needed to take Tesla private.\n\u201cThis is an extremely important point, and you seem to be deliberately avoiding it,\u201d Mr Musk said to Mr Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.\nBut under questioning from Mr Porritt, Mr Musk acknowledged he had not mentioned his SpaceX shares as a potential funding source in a 2021 deposition. He later said he had mentioned using those shares in a deposition that was part of an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission into his efforts to take Tesla private. NYTIMES"}
