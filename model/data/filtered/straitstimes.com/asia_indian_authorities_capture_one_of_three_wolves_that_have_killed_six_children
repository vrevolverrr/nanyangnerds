Authorities continue to pursue the other two wolves.\n\"The district administration and forest department have deployed several teams to guard the villages and catch hold of them,\" Badhawan said.\n\"The situation is a bit tricky as this particular species of wildlife is very cunning in nature. We have advised the villagers to not sleep in the open along with their children.\"\nWhile leopard and tiger attacks are regularly reported in India, wolf attacks are unusual.\nAuthorities in Bahraich have also installed loudspeakers and flood lights to deter the animals. Forest officials from five nearby districts have been deployed to help capture the animals, Badhawan said.\n\"We are planning to use elephant dung and urine to keep the pack of wolves at bay from residential areas,\" he said, adding that wolves typically live in packs of six to 10 and avoid areas where big animals like elephants dwell.\n\"The burning of the dung cake would create an illusion of elephant presence in the area.\" REUTERS"}
