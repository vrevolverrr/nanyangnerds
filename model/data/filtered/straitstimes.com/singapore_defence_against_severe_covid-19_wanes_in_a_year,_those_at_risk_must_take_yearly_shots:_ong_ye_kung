Together, they account for more than 75 per cent of cases now.\n\u201cThis is the second Covid-19 infection wave we have encountered this year. Like for the last wave, which occurred from March to April, there are no plans to impose any social restrictions,\u201d said Mr Ong.\n\u201cWe will treat this as an endemic disease and live with it. After all, there has been no evidence to suggest that the new variants are more likely to lead to severe illnesses compared to the previous variants, and all indications showed that current vaccines continue to work well in protecting us from severe illnesses if we\u2019re infected by these new variants.\u201d\nWhile there are no plans to impose social restrictions, Mr Ong reiterated that the virus that causes Covid-19 has not become milder since the pandemic crisis. \u201cIt is us who have become stronger and more resilient\u201d, and that is because of vaccinations, as well as safe recovery from infections, he said.\nHe was speaking on Friday at the opening of the Stepping Stones Rehabilitation Centre and addiction medicine ward Serenity Centre at the Institute of Mental Health.\nDrawing from the findings of a recent Ministry of Health (MOH) study, Mr Ong said that for those who are best protected from Covid-19 \u2013 with a minimum of three mRNA shots and a natural infection which they recovered from, all within the last 12 months \u2013 the rate of severe illness is about 10 per 100,000 population.\nFor those who are least protected, with no vaccination or infection, the incidence rate of falling severely ill from the virus is over 50 per 100,000 population \u2013 five times more than those who are well protected.\nThe most important finding is that individuals who are well protected with three mRNA shots plus an infection, but who acquired these more than 12 months ago, have the same incidence rate of severe illness as those who are not vaccinated or protected by a previous infection.\n\u201cThis is a clear indication that protection wanes, and it happens at around the 12-month interval,\u201d he said.\nThe MOH study calculated the incidence rate of severe illness recorded during the peak of the last infection wave in April 2023 for the various groups of people.\nThe Health Minister advised seniors aged 60 and above, or those who are medically vulnerable, to keep their vaccination up to date to ensure mild Covid-19 symptoms and fast recovery.\n\u201cThe infection will give you protection against severe illness if you encounter the virus in the future. Before this protection wanes, if you take another jab, the protection gets renewed again,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe should expect more people to fall sick, and if so, hospitalisations will go up, waiting times will go up. If you are a senior, or medically vulnerable due to an underlying illness, please take the necessary precautions, such as wearing a mask in crowded areas.\u201d"}
