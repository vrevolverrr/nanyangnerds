Najib's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Kuala Lumpur High Court will hear Najib's application on Thursday.\nNajib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). The verdict was upheld by Malaysia's top court in 2022.\nAbout $4.5 billion was allegedly stolen from 1MDB, with around $1 billion flowing into the accounts of Najib, Malaysian and U.S. investigators have said.\nThe pardons board in February said Najib is expected to be released in August 2028, six years after he began serving his sentence. It also reduced fines imposed on the ex-premier, sparking uproar in Malaysia.\nNajib is also considering filing a new petition for a full pardon. REUTERS"}
