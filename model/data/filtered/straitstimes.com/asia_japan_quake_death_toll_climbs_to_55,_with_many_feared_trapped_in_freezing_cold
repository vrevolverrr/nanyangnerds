But we have received reports that there are still many people waiting to be rescued under collapsed buildings.\u201d\nMr Kishida said some 3,000 rescuers were finding it difficult to reach the northern tip of the peninsula, where helicopter surveys had discovered many fires and widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure.\nThere are around 120 cases of people awaiting rescue, his government spokesperson said.\nSituated on the Ring of Fire arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin, Japan accounts for about 20 per cent of the world\u2019s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater, and each year experiences up to 2,000 quakes that can be felt.\nMany rail services and flights into the area have been suspended. More than 500 people were stranded at Noto\u2019s airport, which closed owing to cracks in its runway and access road, and damage to its terminal building.\nThe authorities have confirmed 55 deaths, all in Ishikawa prefecture, making it Japan\u2019s deadliest earthquake since 2016.\nMany of those killed were in Suzu and Wajima, another city on the remote northern tip of the Noto peninsula.\nScores more have been injured, and the authorities were battling blazes in several cities on Jan 2 and hauling people from collapsed buildings."}
