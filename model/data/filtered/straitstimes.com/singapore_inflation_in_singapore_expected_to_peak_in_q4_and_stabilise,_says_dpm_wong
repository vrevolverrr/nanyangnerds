The MAS' next monetary policy statement is scheduled for October.\nBeyond inflation, Mr Wong said the Government is concerned about the increasing risks for economic growth next year too.\n\"That is something that we are watching carefully too,\" he said.\nLast week, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) narrowed its range for Singapore's gross domestic product growth this year to 3 per cent to 4 per cent, from an earlier projection of 3 per cent to 5 per cent.\nMTI said the external demand outlook for Singapore's economy had weakened compared with three months ago, while downside risks to the global economy remain significant from the war in Ukraine, inflation and geopolitical tensions in the region.\nWhen asked about the impending hike in goods and services tax (GST) - from 7 per cent to 8 per cent in 2023 and then to 9 per cent in 2024 - Mr Wong said that Singapore is committed to this move because of the revenue shortage it faces.\nGiven Singapore's rapidly ageing population and the increase in healthcare costs, Singapore has to do what is right and spend more, but also in a way that is responsible and which will not leave behind a bigger hole for the next generation.\nThis means increasing revenues, but in a way that is fair and progressive, said Mr Wong.\nHe stressed that the GST increase will not hurt lower-income households because they will be provided with more than sufficient offsets. These include the $6.6 billion Assurance Package that was first announced in 2020.\n\"The higher income will pay the bulk of GST,\" said Mr Wong.\nMr Wong was also asked by Mr Micklethwait if Singapore is planning to introduce new forms of wealth taxes to raise needed revenues.\nMr Wong said the Republic always looks at updating its tax and transfer system while ensuring that it stays fair and progressive.\n\"It is a system that must underpin a society where we ensure that growth is inclusive and everyone benefits from the nation's progress,\" he said. \"That is our fundamental objective.\"\nSingapore has not done too badly if one looks at the last decade, where the country saw broad-based income growth, relatively high levels of social mobility, and a narrowing of income inequality, he said.\nBut the Government will have to keep a close eye on the situation and probably \"have to lean some more in the direction of more inclusive growth\", he added.\nHe said Singapore sees a fair and progressive system as one where everyone pays some form of taxes, but that those with greater means pay more.\n\"It is not only done through the taxation system, but we also can do it through transfers and spending and make sure that spending is targeted at the lower income and those with greater need,\" he said."}
