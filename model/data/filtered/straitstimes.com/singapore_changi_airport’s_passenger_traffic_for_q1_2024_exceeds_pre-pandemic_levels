In 2023, these were Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand and India, with China in sixth place.\nCAG said the roll-out on Feb 9 of a mutual 30-day visa-exemption arrangement between Singapore and China boosted travel between both countries, propelling China to the top spot for the quarter.\nFor the first three months of 2024, Denpasar (Bali), Manila, Taipei, Seoul and Shanghai were among the top 10 cities that outperformed the first quarter of 2019 by more than 10 per cent.\nFor the quarter, 89,400 flights departed or arrived at the airport \u2013 94 per cent of the movements in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn comparison, there were 74,200 aircraft movements in the same quarter a year ago.\nBetween January and March, traffic to and from most regions recovered to or surpassed 2019 levels, with North America emerging as the strongest performer, with traffic exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 25 per cent for the quarter.\nFrom January to March, airfreight throughput, or air cargo movements, totalled 475,000 tonnes, up 14 per cent from the same period in 2023, marking the first quarter of year-on-year growth after seven straight quarters of decline.\nThis was due largely to strong transshipment performance, especially for air cargo flows with China.\nSpeaking at the annual Changi Airline Awards on April 25 at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said Changi\u2019s passenger traffic in the first quarter of 2024 was a significant milestone for Singapore\u2019s aviation industry.\n\u201cWe look forward to the continued growth of passenger traffic at Changi, and will work towards our goal of exceeding pre-Covid passenger traffic levels for the full year.\n\u201cWe have seen through the worst of the pandemic and emerged stronger together,\u201d he said at the award ceremony, which honoured the airport\u2019s airline partners for their contribution to Changi Airport\u2019s growth as a global air hub.\nMr Chee outlined several areas to position Changi Airport for future growth, reiterating that construction on the upcoming Terminal 5 is on track to begin in 2025.\nThe terminal is set to be operational in the mid-2030s.\nAviation workers, he said, will also need to pick up new and relevant skills, and jobs may be redesigned, as the airport taps technology such as automation and assistive tools to augment the human workforce and raise productivity of labour-intensive roles.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, CAG chief executive Lee Seow Hiang said a shortage of manpower will be a major challenge for Changi Airport in the mid to long term.\n\u201cWe have done deep automation in the last few years, and we are now on the cusp of a new phase with the impending launch of document-free travel by the end of this year.\n\u201cUsing your biometrics... as the key to identity verification, we can reduce the need for passengers to repeatedly present travel documents... at many touchpoints,\u201d he said.\nThe improvement will be transformational, Mr Lee said.\n\u201cBy challenging the conventional norms in our business, we hope to take a step closer to our vision of an airport of the future well before T5 opens,\u201d he added.\nMr Lee also gave more details about a planned new hotel at Terminal 2, the third landside hotel at the airport. Landside refers to areas of the airport that are before immigration clearance and accessible to the public.\nHe said the hotel \u2013 billed as Singapore\u2019s first zero-energy hotel \u2013 will be ready in 2028 and have more than 250 rooms, and will be positioned to appeal to the younger set. It will be directly accessible from the terminal\u2019s departure hall via a linkway.\nMr Chee thanked Mr Lee, who will step down on July 1 after 15 years at the helm of CAG, for spearheading Changi Airport\u2019s growth and development.\n\u201cSeow Hiang\u2019s vision and steadfast leadership has transformed Changi into a leading global air hub, and taken the airport through the darkest days of Covid-19, and seen through Changi\u2019s recovery after the pandemic,\u201d he said.\nMr Yam Kum Weng, CAG\u2019s executive vice-president for airport development, who has been leading the Changi East project, where T5 will be sited, will succeed Mr Lee.\nMr Lee declined comment when asked by The Straits Times about his post-CAG plans, at the award ceremony.\nAt the event, CAG named Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines its partner of the year for the carrier\u2019s significant efforts in expanding Changi Airport\u2019s connectivity to China.\nThe 2023 winner for this category was Singapore Airlines, for its role in driving Changi Airport\u2019s passenger traffic recovery in 2022 as the world rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn 2023, China Eastern Airlines launched four new links, including a new route from Beijing Daxing International Airport, making Changi Airport its first South-east Asia point. The other new direct links for the airline are to Hefei, Nanjing and Hangzhou.\nWith the increased services, China Eastern Airlines operated a total of 52 weekly services between Singapore and China as at December 2023."}
