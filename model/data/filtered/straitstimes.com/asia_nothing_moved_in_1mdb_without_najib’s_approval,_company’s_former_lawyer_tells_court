In substance, it was... one individual (behind) all these decisions,\u201d Loo said on Feb 28.\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, however, said there was a distinction among Najib\u2019s three roles.\nHe said Loo, as general counsel, should have known that Najib could not come to a decision regarding the company without referring it to the board of directors first.\n\u201cInstead, you purposely ignored these because you were a part of a conspiracy to hoodwink 1MDB,\u201d Mr Muhammad Shafee said.\nLoo, the 50th prosecution witness, disagreed with Mr Muhammad Shafee\u2019s suggestion and maintained that Najib\u2019s approval from one role was akin to the approval of all three roles.\n\u201cBy the time I joined 1MDB, that was already the practice and we had been relying on professional company secretarial advisors. If they had different opinions they would have done it that way,\u201d she said.\nLoo also disagreed with the testimony of former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner during Malaysian Roger Ng\u2019s 1MDB trial in New York where Leissner said she was the \u201ckey component\u201d connecting fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho to the company.\nNg was a former Goldman Sachs banker who was sentenced to 10 years in jail after a jury in Brooklyn, New York found him guilty of violating US anti-bribery laws, money laundering and illegally skirting Goldman\u2019s accounting controls.\nLoo said she was unaware that Najib had mentioned that she was appointed to legalise illegal documents.\nMr Muhammad Shafee then read an excerpt of Leissner\u2019s testimony that Loo was unhappy with the amount of money she was about to receive from the 1MDB scheme, as it was inadequate.\nLoo replied that she did not agree with any statement made by Leissner.\nNajib, 70, is on trial for 25 charges in total: four for abuse of power that allegedly brought him the financial benefit to the tune of RM2.28 billion (S$643 million); and 21 for money laundering involving the same amount of money.\nThe trial continues before Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah.
