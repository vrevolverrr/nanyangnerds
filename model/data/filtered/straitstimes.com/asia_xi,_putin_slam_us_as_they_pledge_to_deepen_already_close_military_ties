He said both China and Russia were opposed to a drawn-out conflict in Ukraine and its possible transition to an uncontrollable phase.\nMr Putin said he was grateful to China for trying to solve the crisis, adding that he would brief Mr Xi on the situation in Ukraine, where Russian forces are advancing on several fronts.\nShared view of America\nLater, describing their initial session as \u201cwarm and comradely\u201d, Mr Putin outlined sectors where the two are strengthening ties, from nuclear and energy cooperation to food supplies, and Chinese car manufacturing in Russia.\nRussia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency cited Mr Putin as saying: \u201cIt is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone.\u201d\nIn an interview with China\u2019s Xinhua news agency before his departure from Moscow, Mr Putin praised Mr Xi for helping to build a partnership based on national interests and deep mutual trust.\nMr Putin said: \u201cIt was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after officially taking office as president.\u201d"}
