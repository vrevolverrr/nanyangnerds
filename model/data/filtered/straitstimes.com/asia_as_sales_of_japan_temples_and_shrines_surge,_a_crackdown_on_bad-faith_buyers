In fact, considering the value of the religious corporation status, this temple could fetch quite a lot of money,\u201d said 52-year-old Mr Suzuki.\nAs Japan\u2019s population falls and interest in religion declines, there are fewer people to contribute to the upkeep of the country\u2019s numerous temples and shrines.\nMr Suzuki\u2019s Mikaboyama temple, for example, is located in Sanbagawa \u2013 an area three hours\u2019 drive from Tokyo with only 500 residents, and which also has three other Buddhist temples, one Shinto shrine and a church.\nA surge in religious properties coming up for sale has the Japanese authorities worried that prospective buyers are not interested in them for heavenly purposes, but rather, are out to dodge taxes or possibly even launder money.\n\u201cIt\u2019s already a sense of crisis for us and the religious community,\u201d said an official at Japan\u2019s Agency for Cultural Affairs, which oversees religious sites.\nCases of temple or shrine properties being extensively repurposed have triggered public outrage.\nIn Osaka, a temple sold in 2020 was later razed and dozens of graves were relocated to make way for a property development.\nIn Kyoto, a case about a temple that was demolished and turned into a carpark made headlines in 2024.\nOwning a temple, shrine or church recognised as a religious corporation in Japan can confer sizeable tax benefits.\nBusinesses under such corporations that offer religious services such as funerals do not have to pay taxes, while other non-religious businesses also enjoy preferential tax rates.\nA wide range of undertakings are allowed, from restaurants to hair salons to hotels.\nJapan had about 180,000 religious sites with corporation status as at end-2023, according to the agency\u2019s data.\nThe number of so-called inactive corporations \u2013 such as those with no religious events for more than a year \u2013 jumped by a third to more than 4,400.\nWhen monks or priests die without a successor, the overseeing religious group will usually appoint someone to take over, or voluntarily relinquish the site\u2019s corporation status.\nHowever, there are around 7,000 religious sites that operate independently of these groups and are considered easy to acquire, according to the agency and specialist brokers.\nThe cultural affairs agency said it has stepped up efforts to dissolve the corporation status of inactive religious sites to stop them from being targeted by dubious buyers.\nWhen big earthquakes hit, often damaging temples and shrines, agency officials visit religious groups in those areas, warning them about falling prey to such buyers.\nIn 2023, 17 religious corporations were voluntarily dissolved and six were ordered to dissolve. The agency said the number would increase in 2024 and 2025 as it ratchets up scrutiny.\nIt might seem easier for Japan to change its laws to more strictly control the criteria for purchasing religious sites.\nBut the agency said the government is wary about amending laws related to religion, as that could be seen as impinging on religious freedom, which is guaranteed by Japan\u2019s Constitution.\nReuters checks of six websites specialising in brokering the sale of religious properties showed hundreds on the market.\nMost are only obliquely described online with brokers saying sellers prefer to conduct sales as privately as possible.\nOsaka-based broker Takao Yamamoto told Reuters interest is surging. A religious corporation licence alone can fetch 30 million yen (S$270,000), he adds.\nSome religious sites, especially those with profitable graveyards, are advertised for millions of dollars."}
