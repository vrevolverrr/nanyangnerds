Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing.\nThe lawyer also raised questions over the pardon process led by Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah, who ended his five-year reign as king on Jan 30, shortly after issuing the sentence reduction for Najib.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Pardons Board operated the way the Constitution expects them to operate,\u201d Tan Sri Shafee said.\nThe board said in a statement last week that Najib is expected to be released in August 2028, six years after he began serving his sentence. It also reduced the fines imposed on the former premier.\nThe sentence reduction sparked uproar in Malaysia, with critics of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim saying the decision risked undermining anti-corruption efforts.\nNajib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state fund 1MDB. The verdict was upheld by Malaysia's top court in 2022.\nAbout US$4.5 billion (S$6.04 billion) was allegedly stolen from 1MDB, with around US$1 billion flowing into the accounts of Najib, said Malaysian and US investigators.
