The market has a way of minting riches, month after month, even after it is clear the latest breakthroughs are not playing out quite as expected.\nIt happened with dot.com companies in the late 1990s and, more recently, with cryptocurrencies. And Mr Covello, the head of equity research at Goldman Sachs, says it will likely happen with artificial intelligence (AI), too, making it dangerous, if not outright foolish, to start wagering against the likes of Nvidia.\nAnd yet, he has no doubt that the reckoning is coming. It might not be in 2024 or even the year after, for that matter, but at some point, he says, it is happening.\nAs he sees it, the hundreds of billions of dollars that companies are ploughing into AI will not set off the next economic revolution \u2013 or even rival the benefits of the smartphone and the internet. And when that becomes clear, all the stocks that have surged on the back of its promise will come sliding down, too.\n\u201cMost technology transitions in history, particularly the ones that have been transformational, have seen us replace very expensive solutions with very cheap solutions,\u201d said Mr Covello. \u201cPotentially replacing jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite.\u201d\nMr Covello is emerging as a leader of a small but growing cohort of market watchers who are casting doubt on a crucial tenet of the rally that has added nearly US$16 trillion (S$21.5 trillion) to the S&P 500 since late 2022: the idea that the dazzling power of large language models will usher in the next great stage of capitalism, one where corporate profits will boom as more and more work is handed over to intelligent machines, boosting efficiencies and accelerating growth.\nThere are plenty of believers.\nMr Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive officer, has said he is convinced that AI will unleash extraordinary changes, potentially as transformative as those brought by the printing press, the steam engine and electricity. State Street chief investment strategist Michael Arone said it is bringing a \u201cprolonged and unprecedented productivity miracle\u201d.\nEven inside Mr Covello\u2019s own firm, senior global economist Joseph Briggs estimates AI will ultimately automate a quarter of all work tasks and provide a boost to the pace of economic growth.\nSuch speculation, in turn, has set off a very concrete boom as the world\u2019s biggest tech companies invest heavily in a bid to extend their dominance to the newest sphere.\nThat has been a bounty for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom that provide the hardware needed to power AI models. Even utilities have seen sales jump amid soaring demand from electricity-thirsty data centres.\nThe problem though, the sceptics say, is that the commercial hopes for the technology may be significantly overblown, creating the risk of a stock market correction if the tech Goliaths rethink their massive investments.\nMr David Bahnsen, founder and chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, has been preparing for that scenario. He has avoided Nvidia and other large tech stocks, anticipating what he sees as a potential \u201cdisaster\u201d.\n\u201cThe way we make money is to not be holding the bag when the last sucker places that trade on Cisco in March of 2000,\u201d he said, referring to the precipitous drop that the hardware company\u2019s shares suffered after the dot.com bubble burst. \u201cA lot of people are going to lose money if they don\u2019t trade out.\u201d\nSo far, there have been few signs of that. While tech stocks tumbled on July 17 on worries chipmakers will be pulled more deeply into a US-China trade war, they are still holding near record highs. Nearly half of the S&P 500\u2019s advance since it bottomed out in October 2022 has been concentrated in just six stocks: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google\u2019s Alphabet, Amazon.com and Facebook\u2019s Meta Platforms.\nNvidia, which alone has added nearly US$2 trillion in market value in 2024, remains one of the most popular stocks on Wall Street: 64 of the analysts who follow the chipmaker are still advising clients to buy it \u2013 even after a nearly 140 per cent jump in 2024. Only one says to sell.\nThe payoff from all that AI investment so far, though, has been relatively modest.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have collectively pumped more than US$150 billion into capital expenditures in the last four quarters, with much of that for computing capacity to train their own large language models and run workloads for customers.\nMicrosoft, which has been infusing OpenAI\u2019s technology across its product line, said in April that AI services contributed 7 percentage points to the 31 per cent expansion of sales from Azure and other cloud services in its fiscal third quarter, without giving the dollar amount.\nAmazon, with projected sales of more than US$600 billion in 2024, has said only that its AI business has a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar revenue run rate\u201d.\nTo bulls like Mr Adam Gold, whose largest position is Nvidia shares, the focus on some of those numbers is premature. The Katam Hill chief investment officer notes that companies like Meta \u2013 which does not charge users \u2013 are already seeing sales growth by using AI to improve algorithms for advertisement placement and engagement.\n\u201cThese are the smartest, best capital allocators in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re building these data centres to drive profitability in out years.\u201d\nFor some of the customers of the cloud-computing giants, the gains have been less evident. In May, Salesforce shares tumbled after the software company projected the slowest quarterly sales growth in its history, despite long touting the potential for AI to boost sales. According to a survey conducted by San Francisco-based Lucidworks, fewer than half of companies investing in AI have yet to see a significant return.\nMr Covello is doubtful that most ever will. He has followed the tech industry\u2019s ups and downs since joining Goldman in 2000 after stints with SG Cowen and Smith Barney. He specialised in semiconductor equipment companies, racking up awards year after year as the sector\u2019s top analyst.\nTo get an adequate return on the approximately US$1 trillion of AI infrastructure investment he expects to see over the next several years, companies would need to be able to use it to solve increasingly complex tasks. As he sees it, AI has shown the promise of making some jobs, like coding, more efficient, but not by nearly enough to justify the expense.\nIf significant uses do not start to become apparent in the next year and a half, Mr Covello says, the stock market tide will turn. Yet he does not think it is nearing that stage yet, with the continued build-out likely to keep driving investors into stocks like Nvidia.\n\u201cOne of the most important lessons I\u2019ve learnt over the past three decades,\u201d he said, \u201cis that bubbles can take a long time to burst.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
