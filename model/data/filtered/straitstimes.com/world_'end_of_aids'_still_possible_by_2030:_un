They include eight in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 the region where 65 per cent of HIV-positive people live \u2013 as well as Denmark, Kuwait and Thailand.\n39 million living with HIV\nIn a report, UNAids said that two decades ago, the Aids pandemic seemed unstoppable, with more than 2.5 million people acquiring HIV each year and Aids claiming two million lives annually.\nBut the picture is now dramatically different.\nUNAids said that in 2022, 39 million people globally were living with HIV, of whom 29.8 million were accessing anti-retroviral therapy. Those missing out included 660,000 children.\nThe numbers on anti-retroviral treatment have near-quadrupled from 7.7 million in 2010.\nFurthermore, 82 per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV had access to anti-retroviral treatment in 2022, compared with 46 per cent in 2010 \u2013 which has led to a 58 per cent drop in new infections in children.\nAround 1.3 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2022, down 59 per cent from the peak in 1995.\nMeanwhile, 630,000 died from Aids-related illnesses, and it is still the No. 1 killer in countries including Mozambique, said Ms Byanyima.\n\u201cOverall, numbers of Aids-related deaths have been reduced by 69 per cent since the peak in 2004,\u201d the report said.\n\u2018Dependent on action\u2019\nThe end of Aids is an opportunity for today\u2019s leaders to be remembered as \u201cthose who put a stop to the world\u2019s deadliest pandemic\u201d, said Ms Byanyima.\n\u201cWe are hopeful, but it is not the relaxed optimism that might come if all was heading as it should be. It is, instead, a hope rooted in seeing the opportunity.\u201d\nFunding for HIV fell back in 2022 to US$20.8 billion (S$27.5 billion) \u2013 around the same level as in 2013, and well short of the US$29.3 billion needed by 2025.\nLaws that criminalise people from key populations, or their behaviours, remain in place in many nations, UNAids said, giving the example that criminalisation, and stigmatisation, of people who inject drugs prevents them from coming forward for treatment.\nHIV continues to impact key populations more than the general population, it added.\nIn 2022, compared with adults aged 15 to 49 in the general population, HIV prevalence was 11 times higher among men who have sex with men, four times higher among sex workers, seven times higher among people who inject drugs, and 14 times higher among transgender people.
