They attached it to the side of who knows what, hung their rag and said they had captured the city. Well good, let them think they\u2019ve taken it,\u201d Mr Cherevatyi added by telephone.\nThe Ukrainian armed forces General Staff said in an evening statement that 45 enemy attacks had been repelled in total in the last 24 hours, with Bakhmut at the \u201cepicentre of operations\u201d along with the cities of Avdiivka and Maryinka farther south.\n\u201cThe enemy is attempting to take under full control the city of Bakhmut,\u201d it said on Facebook. \u201cUkrainian forces repelled nearly 20 enemy attacks along the front line.\u201d\nMr John Kirby, a spokesman for the United States National Security Council, told reporters in Washington that Ukraine was still fighting hard for Bakhmut, describing the battles as \u201cquite, quite violent and quite close\u201d.\n\u201cEven if the Russians do get it, it isn\u2019t going to change the battlefield dynamics from a strategic perspective,\u201d he said.\nReuters could not verify the battlefield reports.\nLying on the edge of a chunk of Donetsk province under Russian control, Bakhmut had a population of 70,000 before Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\nRussian forces, bogged down in a war of attrition after a series of setbacks, are seeking a victory from their winter offensive but have suffered huge casualties around Bakhmut.\nUkrainian military commanders have said their own counter-offensive \u2013 backed by newly delivered Western tanks and other hardware \u2013 is not far off, but have stressed the importance of holding Bakhmut and inflicting losses in the meantime.\nFinland, which shares a 1,300km border with Russia, will join Nato on Tuesday, marking the completion of a swift journey into the Western military alliance following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, officials said.\nIn response, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Russia would strengthen military capacity in its western and north-western regions, state-owned news agency RIA reported.\n\u201cIn the event that the forces and resources of other Nato members are deployed in Finland, we will take additional steps to reliably ensure Russia\u2019s military security,\u201d he told RIA.\nIn warnings to the West against arming Ukraine, Russian officials increasingly play up the risks of nuclear weapons being used in the war, and said in March that they would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus.\nMoscow\u2019s ambassador to Minsk said on Sunday that Russia would move nuclear weapons close to its western border with Belarus \u2013 a move that would place them at Nato\u2019s threshold.\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr Rafael Grossi, will visit Moscow on Wednesday, a Russian envoy said.\nMr Grossi would meet a Russian delegation and discuss the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, located in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine, near the front line of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.\nRussia calls its invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, claiming Kyiv\u2019s ties to the West posed a security threat. Kyiv and the West call the war an unprovoked assault to subdue an independent country.\nTens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers on both sides have been killed. Russia has destroyed Ukrainian cities and forced millions of people to flee their homes, and it claims to have annexed nearly a fifth of Ukraine.\nIn Moscow, the Kremlin accused Ukraine of organising the murder of prominent war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky on Sunday in a St Petersburg cafe and charged a 26-year-old Russian woman, Darya Trepova, with terrorism offences over the killing.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday paid tribute to nearly 400 residents of the village of Yahidne in north Ukraine who were held in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago.\nAsked about a Ukrainian counter-offensive, he said: \u201cWe will do it, and they have to know that we will do it, and they have time to go away, or we will kill them.\u201d REUTERS"}
