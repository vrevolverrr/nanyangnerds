Still, she plans to travel about an hour south just to enjoy a few more moments of the eclipse.\n\u201cI\u2019m addicted to that feeling of... for those few seconds or minutes, being one with the universe and being really present and feeling it. And then, of course, there\u2019s always the planning for the next one,\u201d Ms Ferrer said.\n\u201cMy life is measured in eclipses.\u201d\nMs Ferrer budgets for travel and takes vacation from her day job to witness the events, saying this will be her third in North America.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Europe for one of them. I\u2019ve now gone to Africa twice. I\u2019ve gone to Australia three times. I\u2019ve gone to Antarctica twice. I\u2019ve gone to Asia three times. I think that counts for Indonesia. Oh, and a couple of oceans. There were a couple of them, we were in the middle of the Atlantic or the middle of the Pacific. It wasn\u2019t on land anywhere,\u201d Ms Ferrer said.\nHer obsession has had its challenges.\nIn 2017, Ms Ferrer was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, but she delayed treatment to make it to see an eclipse that year.\nIn 2010, her first husband died, and she travelled to South America the following month.\nShe said: \u201cI watched his dreams die with him, and I\u2019m not going to let my dreams die.\u201d\nA year later, Ms Ferrer met her current husband on a dating website where her profile stated she had a mission to see every total solar eclipse. She will also hunt the occasional hybrid solar eclipse.\nMs Ferrer, who has a podcast about eclipses and has traveled across Texas for speaking engagements, says she hopes to make it to age 103 so she can see her 50th total or hybrid solar eclipse.
