It was a public space with a lot of people, including children,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, the police have disseminated images of the suspect to all northern entry points of the Malaysian peninsula and the authorities in a neighbouring nation, Bernama reported.\nThe authorities are seeking Hafizul Harawi, 38, to aid in their inquiries.\nInspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said directives were promptly issued upon the identification of the suspect in the shooting that resulted in a bodyguard getting severely injured.\nSecurity measures have been tightened at border \u201crat lanes\u201d to deter his potential escape to a neighbouring country.\n\u201cI have faith in the efficiency of my personnel. The suspect will be caught soon,\u201d Mr Razarudin told Malaysian news agency Bernama on April 14. He added that the suspect is believed to still be in Malaysia and efforts to find him have intensified.\nHe said initial investigations indicated that the suspect used a 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the shooting. Three bullet casings were recovered from the scene, with one failing to detonate.\nIt is suspected that the man acquired the firearm from a neighbouring country. The incident unfolded around 1.30am when he allegedly discharged two shots at his wife near the airport\u2019s arrival hall entrance, narrowly missing her but striking her bodyguard."}
