The UN estimates that the current adaptation finance gap is US$194 billion (S$264 billion) to US$366 billion per year.\nMs Marisa Drew, chief sustainability officer at Standard Chartered Bank, said that defining the commercial opportunities involved in financing adaptation is key to getting the private sector involved.\n\u201cBecause we are private sector actors, we\u2019re here to make a return,\u201d she said.\nShe added that case studies are valuable in helping firms grasp the opportunities involved in the space.\n\u201cOften, we talk about these things in a very big-picture way. But if we have proof points, your investments that are proving out the return or the project that worked... (we can say) here\u2019s a good one. Copy it. And... that\u2019s when you start to see that scaling effect start to take hold,\u201d said Ms Drew.\nMr Koh said the list of climate hazards that scientists have warned about can serve as \u201cshopping lists\u201d for technologies and solutions to deal with these challenges.\nHe cited one solution his firm will soon announce that it is funding: an artificial intelligence company that analyses satellite imagery for vegetation management for utilities.\n\u201cSparking from power lines, globally, is what causes the giant wildfires we are seeing in the United States, Australia and other countries where vegetation, trees, shrubs, grasses encroach too much on the transmission distribution lines,\u201d he said.\nCurrently, managing this threat is done manually, Mr Koh said, with one group of workers identifying trees growing too close to the power lines, and another group coming in to trim the limbs that are getting too close.\n\u201cHowever, this is not a scalable strategy with the acceleration (of climate impacts) that we\u2019re seeing now in heat events, weather events, and the kind of wildfire risks that we have,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut now we have applications of technology, artificial intelligence, and satellite and drone imagery to enable over 40 utilities today to manage that risk in a much more efficient way,\u201d Mr Koh said.\nThe session was moderated by Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at management consultancy Boston Consulting Group, and featured as panellists Mr Koh, Ms Drew and two other speakers.\nThe two other speakers were Mr Tom Moody, regional director for South-east Asia, climate and energy at the British government\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and Mr Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for the Asia-Pacific at reinsurance giant Swiss Re\u200b."}
