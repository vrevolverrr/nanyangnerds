She got scared and ran out. A few minutes later, another one. Now she is on the floor,\" he said.\n\"I managed to hide. She did not.\"\nA few metres behind him, the body of a young woman in a pink jacket was lying on the ground, her leg contorted.\nAnother woman's body was lying face down.\nBoth were killed between two rows of cars, the front of a convoy hoping to return to parts of southern Ukraine under Russian control.\nDrivers and passengers were waiting outside a logistics centre for permission to cross, which can take days or even weeks, according to Viktor.\nAnother woman who survived and asked to use the pseudonym Katya said some 300 cars were waiting around 8am when the rockets hit.\nUkrainian security forces said three S-300 missiles hit the transit centre and a small forest nearby.\nPolice inspected a large crater several meters deep near the line of cars.\n'Ukrainian, not Russian'\nAFP saw more than a dozen damaged cars and vans on Friday afternoon, all with their windows blown out.\nThe bodies of their former passengers, covered with a white sheet, were still inside.\nA soldier opened a minivan door, first discovering a small dog that had been killed, before pulling out the body of a man by his black jacket.\nThe remains of half a dozen victims in black body bags were placed in an ambulance nearby."}
