It quoted data from NHS England, which oversees 875 hospitals.\nIn Singapore, the problem of overcrowding at EDs has been around for years, but has become worse with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nCompared with what is happening in Singapore\u2019s public hospitals, a 12-hour delay does not seem like a very long wait.\nThe latest statistics from the Ministry of Health showed that half the patients at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital\u2019s ED who needed to be admitted on Oct 17 had to wait for more than 39.2 hours.\nThe same day, half the patients at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital waited in the ED for more than 34.4 hours to get a bed in a ward, after a doctor had determined that the patient needed to be hospitalised.\nThe data does not show what the longest wait was.\nHowever, although not always achieved, NHS England has a target for 95 per cent of patients in the ED to be discharged or warded within four hours.\nHospitals that fail to do so can be fined. So a wait of 12 hours or more is a major breach of this goal.\nDr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), strongly supported the model to move patients out of EDs regardless of the hospital bed situation.\nHe told BMJ: \u201cThe RCEM has always argued that if you spread the risk across the whole patient pathway, you dilute the risk. It\u2019s important to realise that this may not work in every setting, as hospitals vary enormously in their estate and how their flow models work.\n\u201cHowever, the risks in emergency departments are so significant at the moment \u2013 and that has knock-on effects in the ambulance service \u2013 that I think it is beholden on people to at least consider an attempt and try this.\u201d"}
