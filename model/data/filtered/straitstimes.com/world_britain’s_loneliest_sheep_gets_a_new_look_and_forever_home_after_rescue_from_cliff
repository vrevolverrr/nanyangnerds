I\u2019ve never worked with such a calm sheep. It was incredible,\u201d said Mr Wilson, who posted an update of the ewe on Facebook on Monday.\nWhile he did not reveal the weight of the \u201cmassive fleece\u201d, Mr Wilson said the wool will be sent to British wool company Wooldale Wool to be made into \u201csomething amazing that we can raffle off for charity\u201d.\nFiona was first spotted by Ms Jillian Turner during a kayaking trip in 2021. During a recent trip, she was horrified to see the same sheep \u2013 which was then sporting overgrown fleece.\nDescribing the situation as \u201cheart-rending\u201d, Ms Turner said: \u201cThe poor ewe has been on her own for at least two years \u2013 for a flock animal that has to be torture, and she seemed desperate to make contact with us on the two occasions we\u2019d gone past her.\u201d\nBritish newspapers reported on this, calling the ewe \u201cBritain\u2019s loneliest sheep\u201d, which prompted animal lovers to call for her rescue.\nWhile many people were happy that Fiona had finally been rescued, a group of animal activists protested on Sunday outside Dalscone Farm Fun where the sheep was supposed to be rehomed, claiming that the move would make her a \u201cspectacle\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give Fiona a five-star home, we are going to get her some amazing friends,\u201d he said in a Facebook video.\nHe said the farm is closed for winter for the next five months, which will allow her \u201cloads of time to settle in\u201d.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to be bugging her, we\u2019ll just get to know her, let her do her own thing,\u201d said Mr Best, who added that their animal track record is \u201cimpeccable\u201d.\n\u201cWe are literally giving her the best home she could possibly get \u2013 and it\u2019s being blocked at the moment. And it\u2019s a crying shame.\u201d\nBut in a live video update on Monday, Mr Best said Fiona had arrived at her \u201cforever home\u201d in Dalscone Farm on Sunday night.\n\u201cShe got in under the cover of darkness\u2026 We have to keep everything almost under wraps while we got her here under minimal fuss,\u201d he said, adding that the farm is the right place for her.\nHe said Fiona has a \u201csuper chilled\u201d temperament and has settled in and is doing \u201cabsolutely phenomenal\u201d.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s loneliest sheep is lonely no more.\u201d"}
