Higher interest rates are a negative for tech and growth stocks because their valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05 points to 32,945.24, the S&P 500 lost 31.2 points, or 0.74%, to 4,173.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 262.59 points, or 2.04%, to 12,581.22.\nThe Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks fell 1.9% and was down more than 20% from its November record closing high. The Cboe volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose. The S&P financial index rose 1.3% as US Treasury yields jumped to 2-1/2-year highs.\nThe healthcare sector advanced 0.7%, with UnitedHealth Group up 1%. Energy slid 2.9%, as Brent crude fell below $110 a barrel, a week after it rose as high as $139 due to the Ukraine crisis.\nOil and other commodity prices have shot up following tough Western sanctions against Russia. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.97-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 26 new highs and 615 new lows.\nVolume on US exchanges was 14.26 billion shares, compared with the 13.7 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."}
