India called the allegation \u201cabsurd\u201d.\nCanada is the United States\u2019 closest ally and is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance alongside the US, Australia, New Zealand and Britain \u2013 thus raising uncomfortable questions.\nThe US had earlier made clear that it expected the Indian government to work with Canada on efforts to investigate the possible involvement of Delhi agents in Mr Nijjar\u2019s murder.\nBut while the matter was discussed in Dr Jaishankar\u2019s meetings in Washington, it was clearly done so quietly.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting the minister on Thursday, said he hoped India and Canada would work together to resolve the matter, and that those responsible for the June 18 killing should be held accountable.\nBut the US State Department\u2019s official readout of their meeting made no mention of the issue. Instead, it said they had \u201cdiscussed a full range of issues, including key outcomes of India\u2019s G-20 presidency\u2026 (and) emphasised the continued importance of cooperation\u2026 in particular in the areas of defence, space, and clean energy\u201d.\nAt a talk and discussion at the conservative think-tank Hudson Institute on Friday, Dr Jaishankar said the US side had shared its \u201cassessment of the... situation\u201d.\n\u201cI explained to them, at some length, the summary of the concerns which I had,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, we both came out of those meetings better informed.\u201d\nIndia maintains that Canada has for too long tolerated the activities of what analysts say is a small minority among the country\u2019s around 770,000 Sikh population, who advocate Khalistan, a separate homeland for Sikhs carved out of India\u2019s Punjab state.\nMr Jeff Smith, director of the Asian Studies Centre at conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation, told The Straits Times that the minister\u2019s visit was a sign of the maturity and growth of the US-India relationship.\n\u201cIssues that might have once caused considerable diplomatic friction are being dealt with responsibly behind closed doors without hindering momentum in practical cooperation across multiple domains,\u201d Mr Smith said.\nThe success of the Sept 9 to 10 Group of 20 summit in New Delhi, and the launch of the much-talked-about India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor initiative, are cementing India\u2019s growing leadership of the Global South, said Dr Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute\u2019s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia.\n\u201cThe US government has gone out of its way to emphasise the criticality of the partnership with India,\u201d Dr Pande told ST. \u201cThe partnership is on an upward trajectory.\u201d\nAt the Hudson Institute, Dr Jaishankar made the point that India is now \u201cworking with\u201d the US. \u201cIn the past, we have always dealt with each other, sometimes not entirely happily,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWorking with each other is really uncharted territory \u2013 a territory which we have both entered in the last few years. And it has required both of us really to overcome what (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi) called the hesitations of history.\u201d\nDr Jaishankar\u2019s visit to Washington, on the heels of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was an opportunity to demonstrate that US-India ties remain strong, and also to begin to find a path out of the crisis with Canada, said Ms Lisa Curtis, a former deputy assistant to the US president and the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for South and Central Asia from 2017 to 2021.\n\u201cIndia\u2019s critical role in the Quad and in dealing with the China challenge means the Biden administration will seek to compartmentalise this incident from the broader strategic relationship,\u201d said Ms Curtis, now a senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Programme at the Centre for a New American Security, a Washington think-tank.\nThe Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, comprises India, Australia, Japan and the US in a loose, largely maritime coalition, focused on commitment to a free and open as well as stable Indo-Pacific. India is due to host a Quad summit in 2024.\n\u201cSix or seven years ago, there might have been more churn in the US system over (Canada\u2019s) allegations,\u201d Ms Curtis told ST.\n\u201cBut now that US-China competition is the No. 1 foreign policy issue for the United States, Washington will do everything it can to avoid disrupting the positive trajectory in its ties with India, while also upholding fundamental principles regarding human rights and law and order,\u201d she said."}
