His predecessor and brother, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, reigned for 14 years and shaped the Gulf state\u2019s foreign policy for two generations.\nSheikh Nawaf, whose casket was draped in Kuwait\u2019s flag, was buried at Sulaibikhat cemetery alongside his kin, after prayers at Bilal bin Rabah mosque. He died aged 86.\nDraped in a Kuwaiti flag, the coffin of Sheikh Nawaf, whose cause of death was not disclosed, was carried into a Kuwait mosque for prayers ahead of a burial ceremony that was broadcast on state television.\nAttendance was largely limited to ruling family members, making for an intimate farewell for the emir who reigned for three years.\n\u201cThe choice reflects the late emir\u2019s low-profile character,\u201d said Bader al-Saif, a history professor at Kuwait University.\nAbdullah Sabah Al-Mulla, a 56-year-old Kuwaiti professor, said the nation has lost a \u201cgreat father\u201d in Sheikh Nawaf.\n\u201cHe did not put a barrier between him and anyone. To him, all the people were equal,\u201d he said.\nSheikh Nawaf\u2019s six decades in public service included stints as minister of defence, interior and labour. He was also deputy chief of the national guard and a governor.\nPay respects\nDignitaries from around the world, including US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, were due in Kuwait to pay their respects. Qatar\u2019s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani arrived in Kuwait in the afternoon.\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also paid tribute to the late ruler he described as a \u201cvalued partner and friend\u201d of the United States.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian was also due to present condolences on behalf of President Ebrahim Raisi.\nHe would stress the importance of the development of bilateral relations in meetings with senior Kuwait officials, Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said.\nSingapore\u2019s President Tharman Shanmugaratnam expressed his condolence to Sheikh Mishal in a letter on Dec 17.\nCalling Sheikh Nawaf a \u201cdistinguished leader who devoted his life to the service of Kuwait\u201d, Mr Tharman said the late leader\u2019s contributions were \u201cinstrumental in the development and prosperity of modern Kuwait\u201d.\nThe president of regional power the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, on X wished Kuwait\u2019s new ruler success and said he would work with Sheikh Mishal to advance cooperation in the Gulf.\nSheikh Nawaf died on Dec 16. He was 83 when he became emir in 2020, at the time the oldest ruler to take power in the Gulf state that was invaded and occupied by Iraq in 1990.\nThe late emir was perceived domestically as a consensus-builder who sought to repair a long strained relationship between the parliament and government and who pardoned dozens of dissidents and other citizens who had voiced public criticisms.\nAcross Kuwait City, large digital billboards displayed pictures of the late ruler, hailed as the \u201cemir of wisdom, forgiveness and peace\u201d.\nFlags where lowered to half-mast amid a 40-day mourning period that will also see government offices shut until Tuesday.\nSpeaking outside the mosque where the funeral took place, Kuwaiti citizen Ghanem al-Sulaimani said he was saddened by the death of the man he called the \u201cemir of humility and forgiveness\u201d.\n\u201cHe left a great legacy... distinguished by his great love for his people,\u201d he told AFP.\nEid Abdullah Al Fraih, a 60-year-old Kuwaiti retiree, said he was captivated by the late emir\u2019s humility and compassion and that he believed Sheikh Mishal would continue his predecessor\u2019s efforts to improve ties between the government and parliament.\n\u201cKuwait will be prosperous (under his reign). The (political and economic) situation will improve, God willing,\u201d he said.\nSuccession\nBorn in 1937, Sheikh Nawaf took over as emir in September 2020 upon the death of his half-brother, Sheikh Sabah, at the age of 91.\nHe issued numerous amnesties for political prisoners, earning him the nickname \u201cemir of pardons\u201d.\nOne of his last moves before his death was the signing of a draft decree approved by cabinet late last month, ordering the release of dozens of political prisoners.\nSheikh Nawaf was defence minister when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, setting off a war that drew in armies from around the world to end the occupation.\nAnd he was interior minister when Kuwait faced a severe threat from Islamist militants in 2005.\nThe episodes deeply marked the country, but Sheikh Nawaf\u2019s low-profile style meant he remained a relatively popular figure.\nHe is succeeded by his half-brother, Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who was named crown prince in 2020.\nComing to power at the age of 83, Sheikh Meshal, a veteran of Kuwait\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus, is not new to the duties of the emir, having assumed most of his predecessor\u2019s key tasks in 2021."}
