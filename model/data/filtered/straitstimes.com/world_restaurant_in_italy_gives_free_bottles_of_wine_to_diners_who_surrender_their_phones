It really is a beautiful thing to see people embracing it \u2013 they are talking to each other, rather than looking at photos or responding to messages on their phones.\u201d\nLike Al Condominio, other restaurants around the world have also encouraged their patrons ditch their devices to enjoy their meals.\nIn 2018, a restaurant in Sydney called Contact Bar and Kitchen offered every customer a free glass of wine for putting their phones in a locker behind the bar.\nThe same year, an Italian-American restaurant chain named Frankie & Benny\u2019s in the United Kingdom gave out free kids\u2019 meals to those who participated in the exercise.\nIn 2022, an Indian restaurant named Spice Fusion in the United Kingdom offered diners a 20 per cent discount off their bill if they locked away their phones.\nIt is unclear if the restaurants still offer these perks."}
