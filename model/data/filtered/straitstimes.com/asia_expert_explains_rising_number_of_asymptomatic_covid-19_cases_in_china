They are at risk of developing into cases with symptoms and taking a sharp turn for the worse,\" he said.\nFor generally asymptomatic carriers, the key is to put them under medical observation in isolation. Taking traditional Chinese medicine is encouraged, first to prevent them from showing symptoms and developing into moderate cases; second to help their nucleic acid tests turn negative as soon as possible.\nAccording to Prof Zhang, timely nucleic acid testing after a virus outbreak, along with widespread vaccination in the country also explained why most cases being found were asymptomatic.\nChina reported 1,629 confirmed coronavirus cases for Tuesday, the national health authority said on Wednesday, compared with 1,293 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 1,565 were locally transmitted, the National Health Commission said, versus 1,228 a day earlier. The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 7,196 compared with 5,758 a day earlier.\nThere were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,638. As of Tuesday, mainland China had confirmed 147,437 cases.\nThe current strategy adopted by Shanghai is aimed at breaking transmission chains by rotating grid testing and lockdowns of areas with higher exposure to the virus, according to Dr Zhang Wenhong, head of the infectious disease department at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai.\nThe hiking number of asymptomatic cases bring challenges to virus prevention and control in the country. \"Rapid and strict work tracing the source of the outbreak must be carried out. Only by finding all asymptomatic carriers in the shortest time and completely blocking community transmission can achieve zero-Covid in the whole society,\" Prof Zhang said."}
