And the trend could get worse, say animal groups, which have seen a spike in the number of pets they have to find new homes for.\nWith inflation pushing up the cost of veterinary fees and services by at least 10 per cent to 20 per cent and pandemic supply disruptions causing a significant jump in costs of medical consumables and drugs, pet ownership has become more expensive."}
