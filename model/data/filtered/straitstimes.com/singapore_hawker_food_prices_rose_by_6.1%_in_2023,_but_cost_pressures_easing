A total of 16 commonly sold food items and beverages were analysed.\nIn response to queries, SingStat said price increases were also observed at restaurants, which saw a 5.9 per cent increase, and in fast food, which was up 7.7 per cent.\nSingStat\u2019s study also found that at hawker centres, drinks saw the largest price increase of 6.9 per cent, while at coffee shops and foodcourts, prices of noodle and rice items recorded the largest increases of 8 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively.\nCGS International economic adviser Song Seng Wun said prices of ingredients are affected by global trends such as climate change and war, which drove up prices of cooking oil, chicken, sugar and cocoa, among other ingredients.\nThe price spike in 2023 could also have been because some hawkers chose to raise prices at one go, rather than have incremental increases every year, said Dr Teo Kay Key, a research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies. This finding was similar to results from her 2023 study on food prices called the Makan Index project.\n\u201cStall owners might have waited for the cost increases in different areas, such as utilities, rent, GST (goods and services tax), ingredients, and delivery, logistics or supply chain, to stabilise somewhat before deciding on the exact price increase, and to do a larger increase at one go.\u201d\nMulling over keeping prices low\nHokkien mee hawker Mitchell Ong, 26, who has a stall at Golden Mile Food Centre, said ingredient and electricity costs are the key challenges he faces in keeping prices low.\nThe cost of 1kg of lime rose from $4 to $6 after the GST hike, and electricity prices went up from about $1,000 to $1,800 a month.\nThis drove him to raise prices for a plate of hokkien mee by $1, to $5, $6 and $7 currently, depending on the portion size.\nWhen asked how he keeps costs low, he said: \u201cI cut down on my own expenses, cutting down on my meals from three to two a day. I also work longer hours now... (previously I worked) from 11.30am to 8pm, (now I work) from 10.30am to 9pm, or even 10pm.\u201d\nMr Fadzil Mohd Alip, 28, a hawker at a halal Western food store in Golden Mile Food Centre, said: \u201cGenerally, protein prices increased the most during the GST hike. Increasing costs of oil, electricity and dried goods are more manageable.\u201d\nHe raised the price of his chicken chop from $7.50 to $8.50 in February, but added two side dishes, baked beans and garlic bread, on top of the original fries and coleslaw.\nThe increase in prices of hawker food has not gone unnoticed among diners The Straits Times spoke to.\nMs Esther Tay, a diner at Koufu Toa Payoh Central, orders a cup of kopi-o every lunch break. The 49-year-old real estate agent noted that although kopi-o is already the cheapest option, its price has increased by 20 per cent at some places.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a place at Clementi that sold a cup of kopi-o for $1.10, but when I went back after about two or three weeks, the price had increased to $1.40. I have to buy it, even though it\u2019s expensive, because I need it.\u201d\nMs Jackie Wong, 70, a retired clerk, said that she will turn to cheaper alternatives to a prawn mee stall she frequents if the price of the dish \u2013 which has gone up from $4 to $5 in the past two years \u2013 increases too much. But she is willing to pay more for higher-quality food and drinks, such as coffee from a stall called Kopi More at Golden Mile Food Centre.\n\u201cThe first time I came here, it was only $1.80, but it slowly increased to $2.50 as of late,\u201d she said.\n\u201cKopi More coffee is made by the cup (not in bulk) and has better coffee beans than others. Nowadays, coffee already costs $1.50 to $1.60; I find it worth it to top up for a tastier cup of coffee.\u201d"}
