There are currently five operators covering different parts of Singapore.\nEVe chief executive Derek Tan told The Straits Times that details like how many of the ultra-fast chargers will be brought in and where these will be located are still being discussed, but \u201cone to two\u201d chargers will be ready by the end of 2024.\nEach charger will have two charging nozzles to serve two vehicles at a time.\nOn where the chargers will be installed, Mr Tan said the selected sites must have sufficient electricity to power them, as EVe wants to avoid incurring expensive and complex upgrades to charging infrastructure.\nAt least one of the locations being considered will be able to accommodate bigger EVs like minibuses, he added.\nIt will be up to the charging service operators to negotiate terms like the price of the charger with Huawei and put the chargers into operation.\nNeither EVe nor Huawei gave an estimate on how much it will cost to install the ultra-fast chargers when asked.\nWhen Huawei unveiled the ultra-fast charger in 2023, the tech giant claimed it was able to deliver enough charge in five minutes to add 200km of operating range.\nBy 2024, the company wants to have 100,000 charging stations with such chargers across more than 340 cities and major highways in China.\nHuawei said the charger is able to deliver electricity to the EV batteries so quickly because it uses liquid cooling, which is more effective in bringing down operating temperatures than the fans that are commonly used on many EV chargers. High temperature limits how fast a battery can be charged.\nThe charger that will be launched in Singapore is a slightly tuned-down version of the one in China, being rated at 480 kilowatts instead of 600kW.\nThis is to comply with the current ceiling under the latest national EV charging standard in Singapore, which was raised to 500kW in 2022 from 200kW. The kilowatt measurement refers to the charger\u2019s speed.\nThe Huawei chargers will be among the 120 fast chargers to be installed at around 60 HDB carparks, including in Boon Lay, Redhill, Kallang Bahru, Tampines and Woodlands.\nAs at March 18, there are 2,984 publicly accessible EV chargers.\nLogistics company Ninja Van Singapore has more than 10 electric vans in its fleet that are charged at commercial or residential carparks.\n\u201cDepending on the drivers, some prefer charging overnight to get it to a full charge while some prefer to go to fast charging stations,\u201d said the company\u2019s spokeswoman, adding that having more charging options with different speeds will definitely help its drivers."}
