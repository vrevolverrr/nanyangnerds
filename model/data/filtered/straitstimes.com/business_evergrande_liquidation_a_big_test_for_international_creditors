For global investors, what happens to the remnants will have implications far beyond one property developer.\nKey is whether the Jan 29 ruling will be followed in mainland China, which has a separate legal system. While Evergrande\u2019s shares and dollar bonds are traded in Hong Kong, the bulk of Evergrande\u2019s US$242 billion (S$324 billion) of assets are located in the mainland.\nFew expect the process to be straightforward \u2013 there is no precedent for a company the size of Evergrande to be wound up by a Hong Kong court, and the firm has multiple units.\nYet, an unfavourable outcome for foreign investors risks exacerbating already acute pessimism towards China, as well as undermining Hong Kong\u2019s role as a vital fund-raising centre for the nation\u2019s companies.\n\u201cInternational investors will be watching closely to see if mainland courts accept the Hong Kong court\u2019s ruling,\u201d said Mr Lee Kher Sheng, Asia-Pacific co-head of Alternative Investment Management Association, whose hedge and private credit fund members collectively oversee more than US$3 trillion.\n\u201cThat could set an important precedent regarding Hong Kong\u2019s ability to have its legal judgments enforced in China.\u201d\nThe uncertainty underscores the growing concern among investors that their interests will always be secondary to those of the Communist Party.\nAbrupt crackdowns on the private industry from property to tech have hammered stock valuations, along with concern over an economic slowdown.\nLast week, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of stocks in Hong Kong fell towards its lowest level since 2005.\nPrices of Evergrande\u2019s shares and bonds suggest holders have little faith in recovery.\nIts shares fell to 16 HK cents before they were halted on Jan 29, a fraction of its initial public offering price of HK$3.50 in 2009.\nMost of Evergrande\u2019s dollar notes have been indicated at about 1.5 cents on the dollar, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.\nHong Kong\u2019s insolvency proceedings have limited recognition in China, whose courts may also appoint administrators in their own jurisdictions.\n\u201cThe liquidation order should have very limited immediate impact on Evergrande\u2019s onshore operations or assets,\u201d said Mr Brock Silvers, managing director at private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital.\n\u201cWhile the liquidator will likely be able to assert control over offshore assets, its authority won\u2019t be recognised onshore.\u201d\nChinese officials have also made it clear in the past that they favour the completion of unfinished property projects and paying off contractors over creditor interests \u2013 a priority seemingly backed by Evergrande.\n\u201cThe company has made all efforts possible and is sorry about the winding-up order,\u201d Evergrande chief executive Shawn Siu said in a statement.\n\u201cThe company will ensure home deliveries and steadily promote normal operation of the group.\u201d\nIt will also communicate with the appointed liquidator, he added.\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande illustrates the central role Hong Kong has played in the development of China\u2019s private enterprise.\nChairman Hui Ka Yan founded Evergrande in 1996 in the nearby city of Guangzhou, but it was Hong Kong\u2019s deep capital markets and access to international investors that supercharged the company\u2019s growth.\nIn the decade after the company\u2019s listing, its shares surged as much as 800 per cent to be among Asia\u2019s hottest investments, while Chinese property junk debt \u2013 led by Evergrande \u2013 turned into one of the most profitable and popular corporate bond trades globally.\nMr Hui became one of the world\u2019s richest people.\nAfter President Xi Jinping cracked down on leverage in the property market in 2021, Evergrande \u2013 with more than US$300 billion of liabilities \u2013 foundered.\nChina\u2019s junk bond market collapsed as investor confidence in the ability of firms to repay dwindled. Like many of its peers, Evergrande defaulted on its debt.\nIn 2023, Mr Hui was placed under police control on suspicion of committing crimes.\nRegardless of how mainland courts respond, the liquidation \u2013 led by Alvarez & Marsal \u2013 will be a challenging process.\nMost Evergrande projects are operated by local units, making it difficult for the offshore liquidator to seize. More than 90 per cent of the company\u2019s assets are located in mainland China, according to a court filing.\nThe winding up of Evergrande is uncharted waters, said Alternative Investment\u2019s Mr Lee. \u201cThis will be a complex, multi-year process with many open questions.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
