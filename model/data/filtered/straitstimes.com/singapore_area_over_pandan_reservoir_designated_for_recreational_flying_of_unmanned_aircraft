Iswaran at the launch event on Sunday (July 17).\n\"There's a very strong uptick in the activity level in the unmanned aircraft community in Singapore and we see recreational use rising significantly,\" said Mr Iswaran, noting that the number of registered unmanned aircraft in Singapore has increased fourfold.\n\"A flying area that is aviation-safe and safe for the public is an important consideration for us, especially in a place like Singapore, where our living environment is quite dense. We want to be able to accommodate a diversity of activities but also want to make sure they're done in a safe manner,\" he said.\nExamples of unmanned aircraft include drones, radio-controlled aircraft and remote-controlled kites.\nAt the flying area over the Pandan Reservoir, unmanned aircraft users will still have to adhere to prevailing rules set by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).\nThis includes not flying an unmanned aircraft higher than 60m above mean sea level. Any unmanned aircraft with a total weight above 250g also must be registered with CAAS before users are allowed to operate it.\nAs at June 30, there are 16,095 registered unmanned aircraft.\nPermits are still required for those who fly an unmanned aircraft above 25kg and those who do non-recreational flying.\nCAAS said that more than 80 per cent of registered unmanned aircraft weigh between 250g and 1.5kg.\nThe boundary of the flying area over the Pandan Reservoir waters is marked with yellow buoys and is at least 400m away from the nearest housing blocks for privacy reasons.\nUsers have to take off and land their unmanned aircraft within a grassy area demarcated by yellow standing flags.\nBasic amenities such as tables and benches are provided for people to set up their aircraft in a semi-shaded area.\nThe CAAS said that previously, those who wanted to set up their unmanned aircraft had to do so on the grass patch, which is difficult to do, especially when the ground is wet.\nRegular programmes and community workshops to educate unmanned aircraft enthusiasts on safe and responsible flying will held at the area, said CAAS.\nThe flying area came as a key recommendation by the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Advisory Panel set up in 2019, with the aim of reviewing and enhancing Singapore's unmanned aircraft systems regulatory framework.\nThe operating hours for the flying area at Pandan Reservoir are from 9am to 6pm daily.\nThe Pandan Reservoir unmanned aircraft flying area community chat on Telegram, UA Flying Areas, is open to the public to join and receive regular updates and important notices about the site."}
