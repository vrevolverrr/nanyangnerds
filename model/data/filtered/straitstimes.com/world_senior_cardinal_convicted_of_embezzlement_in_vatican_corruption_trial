He was found guilty of fraud and extortion and sentenced to six years\u2019 jail.\nThe Vatican sold the building in 2022 under a cloud of embarrassment, taking an estimated loss of about \u20ac140 million (S$203 million).\nBecciu, who was fired by Pope Francis from his next job in 2020 for alleged nepotism, but remains a cardinal, was also found guilty of one count of embezzlement for funnelling money and contracts to companies or charities controlled by his brothers on their native island of Sardinia.\nAnother accusation involved his hiring of Cecilia Marogna, a self-styled security analyst, also from Sardinia, as part of a secret project to help win freedom for a nun who had been kidnapped in Mali.\nMarogna, 46, received \u20ac575,000 from the Secretariat of State from 2018 to 2019. The money was sent to a company she had set up in Slovenia, and she received some in cash, prosecutors told the court.\nItalian police said Marogna spent much of the money on luxury clothing and health spas. Both she and Becciu were found guilty of charges related to the transfer of money.\nThe other six defendants included the former president and director of the Vatican\u2019s Financial Intelligence unit, the cardinal\u2019s former secretary, Father Mauro Carlino, and three former Vatican employees.
