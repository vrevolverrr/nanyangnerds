Data from the agriculture ministry showed that about 2.5% of the arable land had been mined and was not in use.\nPrime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that when Russia's invasion began Ukraine had not a single demining vehicle. But now it had up to 100 and the government was aiming for at least 200 vehicles and 10,000 sappers to be able to demine the mined area in the next five years.\nAs of September about 139,300 sq km (53,784 square miles) of land across Ukraine - an area larger than England -- were mined, the report showed.\nThe World Bank has estimated that about $34.6 billion would be required to demine Ukraine safely.\nThe report said that innovative financing mechanisms, including an agricultural bond market, would be needed to close the funding gap.
