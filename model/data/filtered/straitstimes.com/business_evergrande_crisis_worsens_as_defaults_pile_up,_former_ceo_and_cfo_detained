A gauge of Chinese property stocks tumbled the most in nine months on Monday, taking its loss in valuation in 2023 to US$55 billion.\nChina Aoyuan Group slumped by a record after its shares resumed trading, and property investing firm China Oceanwide Holdings faced court-ordered liquidation after a Bermuda court issued a winding-up order.\nEvergrande, whose default in late 2021 opened the door to record debt failures by developers, late last Friday cancelled key creditor meetings that had been set for early this week, and said it must reassess its proposed restructuring.\nIt cited sales that have \u201cnot been as expected\u201d.\n\u201cA huge amount of work has gone into the planning and formulation of Evergrande\u2019s restructuring plans, but if the sales forecasts underpinning the turnaround now appear unachievable, it is better to revisit the deal terms before scheme meetings are held,\u201d said Mr Jonathan Leitch, a partner specialised in debt restructuring at law firm Hogan Lovells in Hong Kong.\nCreditors could expect a \u201cdownward revision\u201d in terms and the repayment periods may be further stretched out, according to Mr Leitch. The delay \u201ccreates more uncertainty and will further test the patience of bond holders\u201d.\nThe developments follow news just about a week ago that the authorities had detained some staff of Evergrande\u2019s money management business.\nThe setbacks also come as strains mount among other major developers including Country Garden Holdings, which shocked China\u2019s financial markets in August by missing initial deadlines to pay dollar bond interest.\nThe worsening industry crisis has fuelled concerns among some global money managers that Chinese assets are becoming \u201cuninvestable\u201d amid weak governance and disclosure practices.\nChina\u2019s offshore junk bonds, most of which were issued by builders and which were once of the world\u2019s most lucrative fixed-income trades, have lost more than US$127 billion in value since peaking just 2\u00bd years ago.\nEvergrande did not explain what reassessing debt terms would mean for creditors who have already endorsed the existing restructuring plan, nor did it detail the level of support for its current plan.\nThe difficulty in issuing new notes for the developer could drastically change the design of the firm\u2019s restructuring, and what creditors\u2019 recovery may look like.\nIn an early proposal published in March, Evergrande provided an option for creditors to receive new notes maturing in 10 to 12 years. Or, they could choose a combination of equity-linked securities.\nBut after the latest news, converting all debt to shares of Evergrande or of its arms remains \u201cthe only option for debt restructuring\u201d, wrote UOB Kay Hian analysts, including Ms Liu Jieqi, in a note.\nEven this solution \u201cfaces great uncertainties\u201d, they said.
