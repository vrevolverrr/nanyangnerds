A week? OK, a night?\nThe four members of Nasa\u2019s first Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (Chapea) mission lasted the full stretch, finally reappearing on July 6. They had spent more than a year in a Houston hangar, simulating a mission to Mars. The crew\u2019s primary focus was not how to maintain equipment and physical health but how to live with their co-workers, isolated from family and friends."}
