EU leaders, meanwhile, have grappled with keeping domestic opinion onside as the economic costs of the war and rising prices hit home.\n\u201cWe appreciate the support already provided by partners, we expect new deliveries, primarily heavy weapons, modern rocket artillery, anti-missile defence systems,\u201d Mr Zelensky said.\n\u201cEvery day of delay or delayed decisions is an opportunity for the Russian military to kill Ukrainians or destroy our cities,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a direct correlation: the more powerful weapons we get, the faster we can liberate our people, our land.\u201d\nDuring the talks, Mr Zelensky pressed for a seventh EU sanctions package that includes an embargo on Russian gas. The visit coincided with Russia reducing supplies via its Nord Stream pipeline in what Berlin saw as a political move.\nMr Scholz said Germany would support Ukraine\u2019s path to EU membership \u2013 a step that has caused some misgivings in the 27-member bloc. But he also said requirements on democracy and rule of law would need to be complied with.\n\u2018Unimaginable cruelty\u2019\nArriving on a night train as air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the EU leaders had first walked around ruined buildings and wrecked cars in the nearby town of Irpin, the scene of heavy fighting early in the invasion.\nThe Irpin tour was designed to highlight what Ukraine and its backers say were large-scale atrocities committed by Russian troops, what Mr Scholz described as the scene of \u201cunimaginable cruelty\u201d and \u201csenseless violence\u201d."}
