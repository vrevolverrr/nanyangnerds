All other Asian currencies are already in the red against the US currency, which has advanced in the past 10 out of 11 weeks.\n\u201cHigher US yields and the stronger dollar have been the key driver of the rupiah\u2019s recent weakness,\u201d said macro strategist Vijay Kannan at Societe Generale in Singapore. \u201cThis should continue to be a headwind for bond flows and the rupiah.\u201d\nWhile most emerging Asia benchmark rates are at or near their terminal levels, the Federal Reserve may hike even more. The rupiah has not been immune to the Fed\u2019s higher-for-longer mantra. It has been weakened by capital outflows as a narrowing yield differential with the United States sapped the appeal of rupiah bonds. Indonesia\u2019s policy rate is offering only a 25-basis-point premium over the upper bound of the Fed fund target rate.\nWhile the rupiah declined on Tuesday, it still remains Asia\u2019s best performer this year. In contrast, the Malaysian ringgit and Thailand\u2019s baht have done far worse, and are among the worst performers in Asia. The Taiwan dollar is trading at the weakest since 2017 against the greenback.\nThe Singapore dollar was trading at 1.3742 to the dollar as at 2.28pm on Tuesday. It is down about 2.6 per cent to the US currency this year.\nAsian currencies do not appear likely to erase losses in the near term. US overnight indexed swaps are pricing a one-in-three chance for another 25-basis-point Fed rate hike in November following hawkish rhetoric this week. China\u2019s challenging outlook will also continue to weigh on Asia\u2019s trade-dependent economies.\nOverseas investors pulled out US$1.1 billion (S$1.5 billion) from Indonesian bonds in September, the largest outflow in a year. As a result, Indonesia\u2019s 10-year government yield has climbed above the 7 per cent psychological threshold.\nBank Indonesia has so far not signalled further rate increases but turned to other monetary tools to lure global bond inflows. It introduced the so-called SRBI bills in September, which have not yet proven effective in curbing the rupiah\u2019s losses.\n\u201cBank Indonesia\u2019s defence is likely no silver bullet and likely limited to smoothing moves,\u201d Barclays Bank strategist Audrey Ong wrote in a note.
