{"title": "Triathlon races to go ahead on Wednesday as Seine passes water quality tests", "tags": "world", "timestamp": "2024-07-31", "content": "PARIS \u2013 Organisers cleared the Olympic women\u2019s and men\u2019s triathlons to go ahead on July 31 after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.\nThe men\u2019s triathlon had been scheduled to take place on July 30 but was postponed for a day after the river failed water quality tests.\nNews that the races would go ahead came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\u201cIt is with great joy that we received this news,\u201d Benjamin Maze, technical director for France\u2019s triathlon federation, told Reuters. \u201cNow that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\u201d\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries will kick off the contest at 8am (2pm in Singapore), with France\u2019s Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain\u2019s Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.\nThe men\u2019s event will take place at 10.45am., immediately after the women\u2019s race.\n\u201cThe results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20 am, have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\u201d Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\nParis has spent 1.4 billion euros (S$2.03 billion) of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute on Tuesday had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\u201cIf the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\u201d Belgium\u2019s Marten Van Riel wrote on World Triathlon\u2019s Instagram page.\n\u201cWe are just puppets in a puppet show.\u201d\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\nThe races on July 31 were given the green light despite rain overnight and forecasts for showers around midday which could hit towards the end of the men\u2019s event.\nOrganisers make the call based on analysis of river samples taken the previous day at 5 am combined with a discussion between experts on overnight weather, according to Paris 2024.
