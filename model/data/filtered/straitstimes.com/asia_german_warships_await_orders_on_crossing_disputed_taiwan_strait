They will also make stops in South Korea and the Philippines.\nThey will also take part in exercises in the region with France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the United States.\nOver the last four years, Beijing's military has increased its activities in the narrow strait.\nSailings through the waterway by foreign warships, especially American, are regularly condemned by Beijing, which says such missions \u201cundermine peace and stability\u201d in the region.\nGermany, for whom both China and Taiwan, with its huge chip industry, are major trade partners, has joined other Western nations in expanding its military presence in the region as their alarm has grown over Beijing's territorial ambitions.\nIn 2021, a German warship sailed through the South China Sea, for the first time in almost 20 years.\nIn July, the Luftwaffe deployed fighter jets to Japan for the first joint drills there.\nRear Adm Schulz said he was not planning for any specific security measures should the warships under his command cross the Taiwan Strait, calling it a \"normal passage\" similar to sailing through the English Channel or the North Sea.\nHowever, he anticipated any passage would be closely monitored.\n\"I expect the Chinese navy and potentially the coastguard or maritime militia to escort us,\" he said, describing this as common practice.
