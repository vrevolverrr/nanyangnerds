I was then put in a huge unisex hall near Outram Community Hospital.\n\u201cIt felt like being at Grand Central station (in New York City), with the constant traffic of patients being wheeled in from the emergency room and patients going to their wards,\u201d she said.\nIn his reply to The Straits Times, acting chairman of the Division of Medicine at SGH Geoffrey Samuel said patients from the ED \u201cmay be housed in a transient ward at our linkway to Outram Community Hospital\u201d while awaiting admission.\n\u201cWe recognise that the physical environment may not be ideal, but would like to give the assurance that patients receive the same level of medical care as they would in a normal ward. Our colleagues also ensure that patients remain comfortable while waiting,\u201d he said.\nHe added that patients who are in a less critical condition can receive appropriate care through alternative avenues, including Mobile Inpatient Care @ Home, where patients receive hospital-level care while at home.\n\u201cSuitable patients from the ED and inpatient wards are also transferred to the Outram Community Hospital or transitional care facilities for step-down care,\u201d he said.\nIn the week that ended on Dec 2, 32,035 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 \u2013 the highest number of infections recorded up to that point in 2023.\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) raised the alert on Dec 8, but it reassured people that this number was not as high as that during the pandemic, and that the circulating variants were not known to cause more severe illness.\nMOH also said the average daily Covid-19 hospitalisations rose to 225 from 136 the week before. The average daily intensive care unit cases rose to four from one case in the previous week.\nThe ministry said then that the rise \u201ccould be due to a number of factors, including waning population immunity and increased travel and community interactions during the year-end travel and festive season\u201d.\nWith the bed crunch in hospitals being a reality again, patients are finding themselves in holding areas for longer periods.\n\u201cAlthough the doctors did make their rounds in the hall, I was not able to rest (while waiting for a bed in the ward).\n\u201cMen and women were put together in the same hall. The woman next to me was ranting loudly, while another was groaning in pain. I managed to get a bed just after midnight,\u201d the retiree said.\nSGH has also moved more elective inpatient surgery cases to day surgery.\n\u201cSome patients are cared for in a short-stay ward where they are monitored for less than 24 hours after the (day) surgery. This initiative helps free up hospital beds for acute admission from the ED,\u201d Dr Samuel said."}
