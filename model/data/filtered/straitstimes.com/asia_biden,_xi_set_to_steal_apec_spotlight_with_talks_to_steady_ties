China has accused the US of the same thing in the past.\n\u201cOur door is open to any country or economy facing PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) economic coercive threats,\u201d Ms Melanie Hart, a senior China policy adviser at the US State Department, said on Monday.\nMr Biden will be buoyed by a Pew Research Centre poll showing he is winning the battle for public opinion over Mr Xi, and by the US still being considered the world\u2019s leading economic power by most people in 24 countries surveyed.\nThe US President will be eager to reinforce that image by showing progress in the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, an initiative aimed at stepping up engagement in Asia to compete with China.\nHowever, trade experts say Washington has so far failed to convince Asia it was more than a pale alternative to a fully fledged regional trade deal, when former president Donald Trump quit in 2017."}
