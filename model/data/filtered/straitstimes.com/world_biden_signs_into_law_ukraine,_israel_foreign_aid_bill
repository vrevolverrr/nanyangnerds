Israel already receives billions of dollars in annual US security assistance, but it more recently has faced its first direct aerial attack by Iran.\nAid supporters hope the humanitarian assistance will help Palestinians in Gaza, which has been devastated by Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas to retaliate for the Oct 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people.\nGaza health authorities say the campaign has led to the deaths of more than 34,000 civilians in the Palestinian enclave.\nIt was the second time in 2024 that the Democratic-led Senate passed security aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific.\nThe last Bill, more than two months ago, garnered 70 per cent support in the 100-member Chamber from Republicans and Democrats. But leaders of the Republican-controlled House would not allow a vote on the foreign aid until last week.\nThe legislation\u2019s progress has been closely watched by industry, with US defence firms up for major contracts to supply equipment for Ukraine and other US partners.\nExperts expect the supplemental spending to boost the order backlog of RTX along with other major companies that receive government contracts, such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman.\nThe House passed the Ukraine funding by 311-112, with all \u201cno\u201d votes coming from Republicans, many of whom were bitterly opposed to further assistance for Kyiv. Only 101 Republicans voted for it, forcing Speaker Mike Johnson to rely on Democratic support and prompting calls for his ouster as House leader.\nHowever, the House left Washington for a week-long recess without triggering a vote to remove Mr Johnson.
