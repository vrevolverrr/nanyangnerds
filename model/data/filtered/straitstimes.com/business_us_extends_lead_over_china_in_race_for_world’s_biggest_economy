While some of the outperformance reflected America\u2019s elevated price increases, the 2023 outturn underscores a broader point: The US economy is emerging from the pandemic period in a better place than China\u2019s.\n\u201cIt is a striking turn of fortunes,\u201d said Dr Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) China team and is now at Cornell University. \u201cThe strong performance of the US economy, in tandem with all the short-term and long-term headwinds the Chinese economy is facing, renders it a less obvious proposition that China\u2019s GDP will someday overtake that of the US.\u201d\nThe economic outperformance is reflected in the respective countries\u2019 stock markets. US shares have hit all-time highs this week, while Chinese equities are mired in a US$6 trillion-plus (S$8 trillion-plus) bear-market rout.\nIt was not expected to be this way. At the start of 2023, the US was widely tipped to fall into a recession as the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates to combat an inflation scourge not seen in decades.\nChina, on the other hand, was expected to experience a rip-roaring recovery as it reopened its economy fully to commerce after strict lockdowns to combat the spread of Covid-19.\nThat is not what happened. GDP data released on Jan 25 showed the US economy ended the year with a bang, growing 3.3 per cent in real, inflation-adjusted terms in the fourth quarter after expanding 4.9 per cent in the third. Inflation is on its way back down to the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target, and fears of a recession are fading.\nChina, by contrast, is struggling under the weight of a years-long real estate bust and its worst streak of deflation in some 25 years. Exports \u2013 once a critical pillar of growth \u2013 declined in 2023, joblessness among young people has soared, and local governments are saddled with too much debt.\nWhile government figures show the economy met the authorities\u2019 annual growth target, by expanding 5.2 per cent in 2023, there are suspicions that this is not a true picture of what is going on.\nMr Josh Lipsky, a former IMF adviser who is now director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Centre, said: \u201cThe pandemic covered up a lot of China\u2019s weaknesses that are deep and structural and will last through the decade \u2013 depending on their ability to reform.\u201d\nPeterson Institute for International Economics president Adam Posen argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping has greatly compounded the country\u2019s underlying economic weaknesses by his arbitrary and authoritarian exercise of power throughout the economy and society, particularly during the pandemic.\nThat has spooked households and small businesses into hoarding cash, because they just do not know what is coming next. It is a malady that Mr Posen has called \u201ceconomic long Covid\u201d \u2013 a chronic condition marked by a lack of vitality and extended sluggishness.\nThe US, meanwhile, has surprised economists with the resiliency of its economy coming out of the pandemic. Some, like Mr Posen, even suspect the country may be on the cusp of a pickup in productivity growth that will allow the economy to grow faster without generating inflation."}
