The takeover is due to close officially this week, according to Mr Koh.\n\u201cStaff attrition rate, both voluntary and involuntary, you know, was quite high,\u201d he noted at the UBS Investment Conference in Hong Kong. \u201cThat\u2019s because of duplication of roles that we have eliminated.\u201d\nUBS has retained the best of both teams and added net new assets while client retention has been \u201cvery strong\u201d.\nMr Koh said the bank tries not to cut jobs, but roles are assessed every year based on productivity. On behalf of shareholders, it is always right to swop for \u201cbetter and more committed staff\u201d.\nClients have been putting money to work, investing in bonds and the US market, while the China internet industry is \u201ccoming back\u201d, added Mr Koh.\nUBS, which runs the largest private bank in Asia with about US$850 billion (S$1.15 trillion) of assets, is rebuilding in markets such as India. \u201cIt\u2019s a good market for us, but still early days in India, still a lot of heavy lifting to do\u201d, he said.\nZurich-based UBS returned to profit in the first quarter after two quarters of losses, cementing sustained progress in the integration of Credit Suisse after its rescue last year.
