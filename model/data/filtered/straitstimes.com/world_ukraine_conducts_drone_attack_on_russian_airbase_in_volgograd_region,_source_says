The official, Andrei Bocharov, said there had been no casualties.\nThe source said the attack was part of a campaign of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian airfields that are used by warplanes to conduct regular attacks on targets in Ukraine.\nApart from missile strikes, Ukraine has in particular flagged Russia's use of cheaply-produced glide bombs fired by warplanes as a menace to Ukrainian positions in the east, as well as cities and towns that have been struck by them.\nEven after the delivery of a small group of US-made F-16 fighter jets, the Ukrainian air force is outgunned by Russia's much larger and well-armed fleet of warplanes.\nRussia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The source said the drone attack was a joint operation conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine and the country's special forces. REUTERS"}
