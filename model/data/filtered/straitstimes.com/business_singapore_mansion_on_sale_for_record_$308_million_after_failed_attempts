The property is labelled as a conservation bungalow, which means it needs to be preserved, and houses a front garden that can be split into two more plots to construct more mansions.\nThe Nassim Road mansion is owned by Mr Cheong Pin Chuan, joint chief executive of Singapore property investment firm Hong Fok Corporation, and his wife. It is being marketed by Realstar Premier Group.\nA successful sale would be a record absolute price for such assets, according to The Business Times, but it will not be easy securing a buyer at that price tag.\nThe property was put on sale for $175 million in 2019 and again marketed by property consultancy CBRE Group in 2022. It failed to sell in both instances.\nSingapore\u2019s mansion market is seeing a recovery in interest, with some high-profile transactions, although many local buyers are still wary of big ticket transactions.\nSome assets have seen their asking prices slashed, including a GCB in Tanglin Hill belonging to convicted Hin Leong founder O.K. Lim that was sold for $39.2 million in August, nearly $4 million off its original asking price.\nThe Cheongs\u2019 property is diagonally opposite another GCB on Nassim Road which Wing Tai chairman Cheng Wai Keung and his wife sold for $230 million in 2019 \u2013 believed to be the biggest GCB transaction to date. The buyer was reported to be an entity linked to Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, who became a Singapore citizen and moved here.\nTypically, a person has to be a Singapore citizen before you can buy a GCB or landed property in Singapore.
