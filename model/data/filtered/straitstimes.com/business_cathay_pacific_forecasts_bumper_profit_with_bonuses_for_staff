If the first-half profit comes in as forecast, it would be Cathay\u2019s biggest since 2010, even though it is still only operating at about half of its pre-Covid-19 passenger capacity.\nCathay posted a loss HK$5 billion in the first six months of 2022, when Hong Kong was still saddled with travel restrictions. The airline\u2019s expectations for the first half already top the average full-year forecast of analysts for annual profit of HK$4.2 billion.\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic was the most challenging period in our history,\u201d chief executive officer Ronald Lam said in a statement on Friday, noting that the carrier recorded almost HK$34 billion in losses over three years. \u201cWe are moving further and further away from those difficult days with each week that passes.\u201d\nIn what the company calls a \u201cspecial appreciation reward\u201d, Cathay will pay staff who stayed through the pandemic up to six weeks\u2019 salary in September, Mr Lam said. A profit-sharing programme will also be introduced for 2023 to 2025, he said, adding that details on that will be shared in August.\nAfter posting a record annual profit, Singapore Airlines said in May it would hand out bonuses of up to eight months\u2019 pay.\nAt the end of June, Cathay paid the deferred dividend of HK$1.5 billion on preference shares held by the Hong Kong government, provided as part of a recapitalisation plan during the pandemic. The carrier said it intends to pay all future dividends as they fall due and buy back the preference shares over the next 12 months, subject to market conditions.\nCathay said its first-half performance was driven by a \u201csignificant improvement\u201d in results from its core airline operations and subsidiaries. Results from its associates, chiefly Air China, continued to drag on the company\u2019s performance. It got a one-off HK$1.9 billion gain in the dilution of its Air China stake, which has dropped to 16.26 per cent.\nCathay\u2019s traffic rose 9.2 per cent in June from May to about 1.5 million passengers. Chief customer and commercial officer Lavinia Lau said frequencies are being increased to cater to strong travel demand. Cargo demand remained flat and will stay that way over the summer before picking up later in the third quarter. BLOOMBERG"}
