Few would have predicted such a scenario before a May 9 general election that he was expected to win.\nMr Amar Singh, the director of police commercial crime investigations, told Reuters that searches were being carried out at the home, at the prime minister's office and a residence he had used, as well as two apartments owned by his family.\n\"We are in the midst of collecting information, we will have more details once we have completed our search,\" he said, confirming that the searches were related to investigations into the 1MDB scandal that had dogged Mr Najib since 2015.\nAuthorities in at least six countries, including the United States, are investigating the multi-billion-dollar scandal over the fund that Mr Najib founded.\nMr Najib has denied any wrongdoing.\nDays after Malaysia's long-ruling political coalition Barisan Nasional was defeated in the election, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad barred Mr Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country.\nMr Harpal, the lawyer, said the police search had gone on for almost 18 hours and was \"harassment\".\nMr Najib had indicated he was \"prepared and willing to extend his fullest cooperation\" to authorities but their long presence and the drilling open of a long-unopened safe suggested\"unwarranted harassment\", Mr Harpal said.\nThe lawyer said police had found \"nothing incriminating\" but took away some personal items, including handbags and clothing.\nMr Harpal also criticised the timing of the raid, saying that Mr Najib's family and staff were unable to properly conduct their religious obligations prior to the opening of fast on the first day of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan which falls on Thursday.\n\"The ongoing cordoning of the road has caused severe inconvenience and annoyance to his neighbours who are using the same road on a regular basis,\" he added.\nAsked if police would arrest Mr Najib, Mr Harpal said: \"There is no indication that they will do it.\"\nA police truck packed with big, blue boxes left the compound of the house on Thursday afternoon, a Reuters witness said. There was no immediate word on what was in the boxes."}
