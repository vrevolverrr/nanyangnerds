There is no indication that creditors have made any such demand yet.\nThe builder, among the world\u2019s most indebted developers, did not pay US$15.4 million (S$21 million) of dollar bond interest by the end of a 30-day grace period after missing the initial deadline of Sept 17.\nA default had appeared all but official after Country Garden told Bloomberg News last week that it did not expect to be able to meet all offshore payment obligations on time. The company is now likely headed for what would be one of the nation\u2019s biggest restructuring exercises.\nA spokesperson for Citigroup declined to comment about the trustee notice to Country Garden bond holders. Country Garden did not immediately offer a comment when contacted on Wednesday.\nHelmed by one of China\u2019s richest women, Ms Yang Huiyan, the developer\u2019s sheer size has made it important to the nation\u2019s economy, where the property market, along with related industries, accounts for about 20 per cent of gross domestic product.\nThe default comes just as Chinese President Xi Jinping steps up support for the economy, issuing additional sovereign debt, raising the budget deficit ratio and even making an unprecedented visit to the central bank.\nIn what is often a prelude to a broader restructuring, the company recently hired advisers to review its capital structure. Its dollar notes have been indicated at around five cents, showing how little money investors expect to recover, after some were near 80 cents in June. Its shares have dropped about 74 per cent in 2023.\nThe Citi declaration may be key for credit default swaps buyers. A panel of banks and investment managers was asked by market participants whether the missed payment triggered contracts tied to the developer, according to a notice posted on Monday.\nThe Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees is meeting on Wednesday at noon London time (7pm Singapore time) to discuss if a failure-to-pay credit event occurred.\nIt also has wider repercussion for Country Garden\u2019s dollar bond holders who sought to organise themselves to negotiate a debt restructuring. Some creditors were already considering forming groups.\nThe company was the country\u2019s largest builder by contracted sales for several years before plunging to seventh so far in 2023.\nDespite that decline, it still recently had more than 3,000 housing projects in smaller cities and about 70,000 employees. Its turmoil could lead to a worse impact than from the debt failure in 2021 at distressed peer China Evergrande Group, given that it has several times the number of projects.\nThe Chinese authorities have been seeking to revive the real estate market after developers suffered record defaults as a builder debt crisis heads into its fourth year. The problems for the property market began in 2020 when the authorities laid out \u201cthree red lines\u201d. Those rules set leverage benchmarks that builders had to meet if they wanted to borrow more money.\nThe authorities have taken several steps in recent months as they try to fine-tune policy, including a broad relaxation of down payment requirements and cuts to some mortgage rates, but these have not been enough to turn things around. Property investment contracted 9.1 per cent in the first nine months of 2023, data last week showed.\nSome prospective home buyers have held back on purchases due to fears that builders might not be able to complete residences.\nUnderscoring the depth of the problems, Country Garden recently said its September contracted sales tumbled 81 per cent from 2022.\nThe company has yet to officially default on any onshore bonds. It won note holder approval in September to extend payments on nine onshore securities with a combined 14.7 billion yuan (S$2.8 billion) of principal. BLOOMBERG"}
