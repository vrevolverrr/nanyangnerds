But when President Tsai Ing-wen hosted Mrs Pelosi for lunch at a neo-baroque palace in Taipei, two men at the table were a reminder that the friendship is coming under strain: Mr Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Mr Mark Liu, chairman of the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker.\nThe global semiconductor industry is now dominated by Taiwan, thanks to TSMC\u2019s meteoric rise. Mr Chang told Mrs Pelosi in stark terms that Washington\u2019s efforts to rebuild chip manufacturing at home were doomed to fail. \u201cHe was pretty blunt, and the esteemed guests were a bit surprised,\u201d says one person who heard the conversation."}
