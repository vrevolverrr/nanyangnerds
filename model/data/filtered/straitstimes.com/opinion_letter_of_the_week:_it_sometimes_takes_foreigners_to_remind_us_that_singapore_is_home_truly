{"title": "Letter of the week: It sometimes takes foreigners to remind us that Singapore is home truly", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2024-08-09", "content": "Reading the articles \u201cTaking home a piece of Singapore\u201d and \u201cFeeling at home in a kinder, more race-blind Singapore\u201d (both Aug 3) filled me with enormous pride, and reminded me that Singapore is a country that is certainly worth living in and fighting for.\nThe foreigners featured in the first article cited several treasured traits, which are ironically often overlooked by citizens.\nThese traits \u2013 different races and religions co-existing in harmony, embracing each other\u2019s ethnicity; well-planned public housing and community green spaces; delicious local food; a local film industry; good governance and the ability to navigate and thrive under challenging geographical and political circumstances \u2013 were immediately apparent to them.\nSome of the traits were further reinforced in the piece by deputy opinion editor Bhavan Jaipragas, who observed the increasingly gracious and considerate behaviours of our citizens after he returned to Singapore.\nHe also contrasted favourably our brand of multiracialism with the situation in other countries where he had worked before, where racism and \u201cenclaves\u201d in both housing estates and schools were apparent and inherent.\nIt is certainly not by chance that Singapore has got to its current state.\nMuch effort was \u2013 and would need to continue to be \u2013 put in to ensure that we can continue to prosper and be relevant.\nWhile Singapore is not perfect (no other country is, anyway), to me, it is a country that I am truly proud of and a place that I can truly call home.\nHappy 59th birthday, Singapore!"}
