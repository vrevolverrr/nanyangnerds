A green sack was shown containing what were described as elements of an explosive device.\nThe detainee was then shown with his face blurred out confessing that he was a Ukrainian agent and had planned to place the explosives in a car parked on the route used by Mr Aksyonov\u2019s cortege in the city of Simferopol.\nIt was unclear whether the man was speaking under duress, and Reuters was unable to verify the footage.\nThe FSB did not name the man, who it said was in his mid-30s and had entered Crimea in June.\nMr Aksyonov thanked the FSB and said he was sure that the individuals who ordered the assassination would be found and punished.\nThe FSB said in May it had arrested seven people connected with Ukrainian intelligence on suspicion of plotting attacks against Mr Aksyonov and other Russian-backed officials.\nUkraine has pledged to retake full control of Crimea, the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, as well as large areas of eastern and southern Ukraine that Russia has captured since launching what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in 2022, something Kyiv and the West call a brutal war of conquest.\nRussia\u2019s Izvestia newspaper reported on Monday that a 13km long traffic jam had formed at the entrance in Russia\u2019s southern Krasnodar region to the bridge to Crimea.\nIt said that Crimean transport officials had increased the number of checkpoints around the bridge on Sunday.
