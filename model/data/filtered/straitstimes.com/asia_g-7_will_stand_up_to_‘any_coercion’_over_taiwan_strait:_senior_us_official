Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says only the island\u2019s people can decide their future.\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said after a bilateral meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken:\u201cThe impact the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait has on our country is a given, but it is a crucial factor in the wider safety and security of the international community as well.\u201d\nMr Hayashi also told reporters that French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said France has \u201cdeep feelings\u201d about respecting the status quo and maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\nJapan said the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong had conducted air operations with jet fighters and helicopters between April 10 to 16. China\u2019s state media said its navy carried out combat training around Taiwan last week.\nRussia too has also been keen to show force in the Pacific, and recently launched naval exercises by its Pacific Fleet, drawing criticism from Tokyo.\nChina is increasingly trying to replace international rules with \u201cits own rules\u201d, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Monday, on the sidelines of the G-7 meeting.\n\u201cMany of our partners in the region feel more and more that China increasingly wants to exchange the existing common binding international rules with its own rules,\u201d said Ms Baerbock, who last week met her Chinese counterpart in Beijing last week.\nThe G-7 comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\nChina\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi \u201chopes and believes\u201d Germany will support China\u2019s \u201cpeaceful reunification\u201d with Taiwan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
