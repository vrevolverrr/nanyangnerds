They had decided to visit it after Ms Fazirah learnt about the open house on TikTok.\nThe strategy analyst said: \u201cIt is a rare opportunity because the Istana is not open to the public all the time. It is our first time entering the main building as well, so it was interesting to see all the art pieces gifted to Singapore from other states.\u201d\nThe Istana is typically open to the public four to five times a year.\nAdding a splash of colour to the crowd on April 21 were a group of six dressed in hanfu \u2013 the traditional clothing worn by the Han Chinese, which has had a revival in recent years.\nLooking like she came straight out of a Chinese period drama, business development manager Crystal Lin said it was the first time the group from the Singapore Han Cultural Society had visited the Istana dressed in the attire.\nMs Lin, who declined to give her age, said they were hoping to use the opportunity to draw attention and promote traditional Chinese culture. She added: \u201cThere were a lot of cultural performances and activities today, and we thought we would add to the vibrancy.\u201d"}
