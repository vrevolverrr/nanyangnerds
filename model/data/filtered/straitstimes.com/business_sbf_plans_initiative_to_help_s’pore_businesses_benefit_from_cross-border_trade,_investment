The World Trade Organisation estimates that trade between allied blocs has grown 4 per cent to 6 per cent more slowly than trade within such blocs.\nHowever, the reorientation of trade flows has also led to the formation of new trade corridors within South-east Asia that have benefited from an increase in imports of intermediate goods from China and exports of finished goods to the US.\n\u201cFor our businesses, especially our SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), this presents an opportunity not only to build your presence in new markets, grow your customer base, but also enables you to diversify and build resilient supply chains,\u201d Dr Tan said.\nMr John Denton, the secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, noted in his address that governments need to strengthen the multilateral trading system amid concerns of growing protectionism and simmering trade frictions.\n\u201cThe demise of the rules-based multilateral trading system will result in greater uncertainty and economic losses for all developing countries \u2013 including a 33 per cent decline in global trade in goods, as well as permanent GDP (gross domestic product) loss of over 5 per cent,\u201d said Mr Denton.\nMr Kwan told the event that trade is vital to Singapore as a small city-state with no natural resources, adding: \u201cHowever, a stable and open business environment cannot be taken for granted, given an increasingly volatile trade and regulatory environment.\n\u201cA coordinated response from stakeholders in Singapore and the broader region is required for businesses to anticipate the opportunities and overcome the challenges of trade and investment trends and remain globally competitive.\u201d"}
