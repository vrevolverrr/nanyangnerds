Dr Yellen has been the first woman to serve as Treasury secretary, Federal Reserve chair and director of the White House National Economic Council.\nShe told the event in Austin that she still has a lot of work to do at the Treasury in the coming months, including another likely meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, her Beijing counterpart, to try to manage an often-tense relationship.\nThe two met in April in Beijing, where Dr Yellen warned China to rein in excess industrial capacity ahead of President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to impose steep tariff increases on Chinese-made electric vehicles, batteries, solar products and semiconductors.\nDr Yellen said she would welcome a visit to the US but also may return to China herself, adding: \u201cMy guess is that we will have, one way or another, a visit.\u201d\nThe Treasury\u2019s top economic diplomat, Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh, will lead a delegation to Beijing \u201cvery soon\u201d to discuss economic issues. Dr Shambaugh leads a US-China economic working group that has made addressing China\u2019s excess factory production a top issue\nDr Yellen said the US-China relationship \u201cneeds to be prioritised and nurtured\u201d by the next US administration, with discussions at the highest levels and among agency staff.\n\u201cWe have enough differences and without a chance to discuss them and put them in context, it\u2019s certainly possible for tensions to rise,\u201d she said. \u201cSo this is something that really requires ongoing attention. I hope that it would get it.\u201d\n\u2018Solid economy\u2019\nDr Yellen also said the US economy has largely reached a \u201csoft landing\u201d with lower inflation after US August jobs data on Sept 6 showed a slight decline in the unemployment rate despite slower hiring.\n\u201cWhen you see pace of job creation diminishing over time, what I love to see is that it stabilises roughly where it is now, and we have to be careful to make sure that it\u2019s not going to weaken further,\u201d she said.\nShe said consumer spending remains \u201cquite solid\u201d and while there is \u201cless frenzy\u201d in hiring, there have been no significant layoffs.\n\u201cI\u2019m attentive to downside risks now on the employment side, but what I think we\u2019re seeing, we will continue to see, is a good, solid economy,\u201d she said.
