Traditionally, an involved party or related company foots the bill for expenses involved in pursuing claims.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, there may be a rise in disputes and the number of companies facing the risk of insolvency, the Ministry of Law said in a statement on Monday.\nThe extension of third-party funding offers businesses, especially those facing financial constraints, an alternative avenue to fund such claims.\nThe move also strengthens Singapore's position as an international commercial dispute resolution hub, the ministry said.\nThird-party funding was introduced in 2017 for international arbitration proceedings.\nSince then, there has been positive feedback on the law and businesses have shown increasing interest in additional options for funding litigation, said the ministry.\nLawyers involved in third-party funded proceedings must disclose who the involved funders are and should not have an interest in the funders or receive any commission.\nWith third-party funding now permitted in certain Singapore International Commercial Court proceedings, amendments will be made to provide professional conduct rules for registered foreign lawyers, the statement said."}
