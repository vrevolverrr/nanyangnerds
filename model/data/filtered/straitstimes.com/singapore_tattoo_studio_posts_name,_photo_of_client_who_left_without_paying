He had paid a $100 deposit for this booking.\n\u201cI am disappointed at how this unfolded \u2013 $500 may not be a big deal to some people, but it is to me,\u201d said Mr Brandon, 31.\n\u201cI spend a lot of time tattooing, which is extremely tiring and taxing. I could have easily given a slot to someone else who would actually pay,\u201d he added.\nThe tattoo studio said the man has other unfinished tattoos.\nAttempts by The Straits Times to contact him on Monday were unsuccessful.\nSaid Mr Brandon: \u201cI just want to make sure that this does not happen to other fellow artists in the community\u2026 It\u2019s a big waste of time. I felt so disappointed and dejected.\u201d\nHe and the studio have reported the matter to the police."}
