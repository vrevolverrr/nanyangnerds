It said two Israeli soldiers had been killed and eight others wounded in the raid.\nIsraeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari blamed militants for the destruction at the hospital, saying they had fortified themselves in hospital wards, fired on soldiers and refused calls to surrender.\n\u201cWe had to fire on the buildings in order to stop that and to kill the terrorists,\u201d he said.\nIsraeli forces evacuated displaced civilians sheltering at the compound, as well as some patients, and placed other patients in a building away from the fighting, Mr Hagari said.\nThe World Health Organisation said on March 31 that at least 21 patients had died since the Israeli raid began in mid-March, though the causes of death were unclear. By this past weekend, 107 patients remained \u2013 30 of them bedridden \u2013 without drinking water and with only minimal medication, the Gaza Health Ministry said in a statement.\nIsraeli forces first raided Al-Shifa in November, maintaining that Hamas militants had built a command centre in tunnels underneath it. Hamas and the hospital director said the facility was solely used as a refuge for civilians.\nThe Israeli military later publicised some evidence to support its case, including by showing reporters a fortified tunnel constructed underneath the hospital grounds. An investigation by The New York Times found that the evidence suggested that Hamas had used the site for cover and stored weapons there.\nAfter little more than a week, Israeli troops withdrew in compliance with a brief ceasefire. But after the fighting resumed, Israeli forces closed in on the hospital again in March in an attempt to root out what they said was a renewed insurgency by armed groups in northern Gaza.\n\u201cHamas and Islamic Jihad have started to rebuild themselves in the north,\u201d said Mr Hagari. \u201cAnd they re-based themselves inside Shifa.\u201d\nHamas called the destruction at the hospital \u201ca horrific crime\u201d and said Israel had perpetrated it \u201cwith full and unlimited support from the administration of US President (Joe) Biden\u201d.\nIn a visit to Al-Shifa on March 30, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, declared the raid \u201cextremely successful\u201d and said it had showed militant groups that \u201ca hospital is not a safe place\u201d for them.\nIsraeli officials and a member of the Revolutionary Guard, which oversees the Quds Force, said the Damascus strike on April 1 had targeted a meeting in which Iranian intelligence officials and Palestinian militants were to discuss the war in Gaza. Among them were leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group armed and funded by Iran. NYTIMES"}
