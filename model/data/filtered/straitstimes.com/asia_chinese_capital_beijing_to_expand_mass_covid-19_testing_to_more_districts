Only a handful of districts on the outskirts of the city are exempt.\nNews of the mass tests sparked panic buying, with Beijingers emptying supermarket shelves in anticipation of a lockdown in the city of 22 million.\nLong snaking queues formed on Monday around temporary Covid-19 test booths around the city.\nSome residents like entrepreneur Wang Yue, 41, are prepared if things take a turn for the worse. She has been stocking up on rice, frozen food and other necessities since the pandemic began two years ago, and now has enough supplies for herself and her seven-year-old daughter for six months.\nA raft of cases were reported in the Chaoyang district last Friday and the authorities ordered residents in housing estates surrounding a middle school, where the original batch of cases was discovered, to be confined at home.\nAt a press briefing on Monday, Beijing municipal authorities disclosed that 70 cases had been uncovered. China is battling its worst outbreak of Covid-19 since the pandemic began in late 2019.\nShanghai has been under lockdown since the start of this month, and the measure has largely left the financial hub crippled, with residents unable to leave their homes and struggling to get food supplies, basic necessities and medical care.\nThose who have tested positive have been taken to spartan temporary isolation facilities, amid widely shared complaints about a lack of shower facilities or sanitary toilets.\nThe woes of Shanghai residents have fuelled fears in Beijing more than 1,000km away.\n\u201cI am not afraid of the virus. To me, it seems like it\u2019s just like the flu. What I am more worried about are the excessive measures and policies that they put in place to control the virus,\u201d said Ms Wang."}
