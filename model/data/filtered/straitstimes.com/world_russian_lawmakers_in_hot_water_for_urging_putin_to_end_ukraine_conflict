These are young people who could be of great use to our country,\" he added.\n\"We demand an immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops.\"\nAs he read the appeal, several lawmakers and the governor of the region, Oleg Kozhemyako, tried to silence him.\nMr Kozhemyako accused Mr Vasyukevich of \"tarnishing\" the reputation of the Russian army and called him a \"traitor\".\nMr Vasyukevich said the statement had been signed by four Communist lawmakers but two of those deputies disavowed the appeal at the meeting.\nA majority of lawmakers present at the meeting then voted to strip Mr Vasyukevich and Mr Gennady Shulga, another lawmaker backing the appeal, of the right to speak at Friday's session.\nThe head of the local Communist faction, Anatoly Dolgachev, said the move had not been agreed with the party and promised to take \"the toughest measures\".\nThe veteran leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, has publicly supported Mr Putin over Ukraine.\nRussian artists, media figures and several business tycoons have spoken out against the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine that has led to a barrage of unprecedented Western sanctions against Moscow.\nBut after three months of the hostilities, there has been no apparent outbreak of dissent from within Mr Putin's inner circle or top officials.\nRussia has adopted legislation that could see people imprisoned for up to 15 years for discrediting the Russian military."}
