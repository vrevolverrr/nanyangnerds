Five arrived in the Russian-held town of Novoazovsk, where Moscow said the wounded would be treated.\nWhat will happen to the fighters was unclear. The Kremlin said Putin had personally guaranteed the prisoners would be treated according to international standards, and Ukrainian officials said they could be exchanged for Russian captives.\nA Reuters witness said seven buses carrying Ukrainian fighters from the Azovstal garrison arrived at a newly reopened prison in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka near Donetsk.\nTass news agency said a Russian committee planned to question the soldiers, many of them members of the Azov Battalion, as part of an investigation into what Moscow calls \u201cUkrainian regime crimes\u201d.\nThe denouement of a battle which came to symbolise Ukrainian resistance gives Moscow total control of the Azov Sea coast and an unbroken stretch of eastern and southern Ukraine, even as its troops retreat from the outskirts of Kharkiv in the north-east.\nOn the international front, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said Sweden and Finland will on Wednesday hand in their respective applications to join Nato, abandoning their long-standing policy of neutrality over concerns about Putin\u2019s wider intentions.\nTheir move will bring about the very expansion of the Western alliance Putin invoked as one of the main justifications for what he terms his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\nPrisoner swop?\nThe complete capture of Mariupol is Russia\u2019s biggest victory since its Feb 24 invasion. But the port lies in ruins, and Ukraine believes tens of thousands of people were killed under months of Russian bombardment.\nRussia said at least 256 Ukrainian fighters had \u201claid down their arms and surrendered\u201d, including 51 severely wounded.\nUkraine said 264 soldiers, including 53 wounded, had left.\nRussian defence ministry video showed fighters leaving the plant, some carried on stretchers, others with hands up to be searched by Russian troops.\nWhile both sides spoke of a deal under which all Ukrainian troops would abandon the steelworks, many details were not yet public, including how many fighters still remained inside, and whether any form of prisoner swap had been agreed.\nUkraine\u2019s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar told a briefing that Kyiv would not disclose how many fighters remained inside until all were safe. Ukraine\u2019s military said units in Azovstal had completed their combat mission.\nUkraine\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Kyiv aimed to arrange a prisoner swap for the wounded once their condition stabilises, but neither side disclosed terms for any specific deal.\nHigh-profile Russian lawmakers spoke out against any prisoner swap. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house, said: \u201cNazi criminals should not be exchanged.\u201d\nLawmaker Leonid Slutsky, one of Russia\u2019s negotiators in talks with Ukraine, called the evacuated combatants \u201canimals in human form\u201d and said they should be executed.\nThousands of civilians are believed to have been buried in mass graves or makeshift pits in gardens, and Ukraine says Moscow forcibly deported thousands of residents to Russia.\nMoscow denies targeting civilians or deporting them.\nUkrainian advances\nElsewhere, Ukrainian forces have been advancing at their fastest pace for more than a month, driving Russian forces out of the area around Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city.\nUkraine says its forces had reached the Russian border, 40km north of Kharkiv. They have also pushed at least as far as the Siverskiy Donets river 40km to the east, where they could threaten supply lines to Russia\u2019s main advance in the Donbas.\nRussia is still pressing that advance despite taking heavy losses.\nAlso on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron, who told him that French arms deliveries to Ukraine would intensify in coming days and that France was ready to respond to additional demands for help."}
