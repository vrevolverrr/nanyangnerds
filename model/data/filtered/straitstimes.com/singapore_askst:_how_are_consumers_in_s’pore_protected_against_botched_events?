The latter option allows disputes between consumers and suppliers to be addressed in a quicker and less expensive way than a civil trial.\nCase provides free advice to those who contact the association via its hotline on 6277-5100, by e-mail or by making an appointment to walk into its office in Ghim Moh.\nIf consumers want Case to follow up on their dispute, they must become a member \u2013 to establish a relationship between the consumer and Case \u2013 so that the organisation can represent them in talks with the retailer. A nominal fee is collected to cover the administrative costs of following up on their dispute.\nAccording to Case\u2019s website, its mediation process resolves about 70 per cent of disputes.\nHowever, some disappointed attendees of the sky lantern festival, like product manager Ong Xiu Yan, are reluctant to pay such fees.\nMs Ong said she was unwilling to pay more money \u2013 a membership fee of $27.25 and administrative charges \u2013 because Case cannot guarantee that she will get the $100 she paid for two tickets to the festival back.\nThe 38-year-old said: \u201cI feel the organisers are capitalising on loopholes, and how they can get away with it without legal implications.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, essentially many could have come up with bogus events, and used terms and conditions or unforeseen circumstances to get away with the money.\u201d\nUnder the Unfair Contract Terms Act, businesses are not allowed to put up disclaimers to avoid liability for breaching their contracts, said Farallon Law managing director Nicolas Tang.\nLawyer Thaddeus Oh said two or more consumers with claims against the same event organiser can combine their complaints into a single claim at the Small Claims Tribunals to save on costs.\nFor a claim that is valued at up to $5,000, a person has to pay $10 for filing fees. For claims worth more than $5,000 but not more than $10,000, the fee increases to $20. When claiming amounts above $20,000, a person is required to pay 1 per cent of the amount claimed.\nMr Oh, a senior associate in the dispute resolution team at law firm Withers KhattarWong, added that the total value of the claims made by consumers represented by one party must not exceed $20,000, or $30,000 if the organiser agrees to it.\nThe tribunals also have the right to order that the claims be heard separately, rather than combined, he added.\nMr Tang suggested that the costs for aggrieved consumers can be reduced with a system that allows those with claims against a common entity to pool their resources and register their cases together so hearings and enforcement actions can be done collectively instead of individually.\nLegal fees can then be shared, he added.\nMore information about how to file a claim at the tribunals can be found at this website.\nQ: Will winning a case at the Small Claims Tribunals guarantee that I get my money back?\nA: While there are laws to protect consumers, the process of getting a refund can still be difficult.\nEven if consumers win a case in the tribunals, enforcement of the decision can be costly.\nMr Tang said: \u201cConsumers will usually need to engage a law firm to enforce the (tribunals\u2019) order, and the cost of enforcement is much larger than the price of the event ticket.\u201d\nIn a scenario where the event organiser refuses to pay, the consumer would have to execute or enforce the order in the civil courts, which would require the consumer to spend more money and time chasing down what could possibly end up being a bad debt, said Mr Oh.\nHe added: \u201cThis weakness is not unique to consumers; even litigants in High Court cases have to consider the issue of recoverability when pursuing their claims.\u201d\nCivil cases are heard in the High Court when the claim amount exceeds $250,000, or in the cases of claims for road traffic accidents or personal injuries from industrial accidents, when the sum claimed crosses $500,000.\nQ: How can consumers be better protected from events that fail to deliver?\nA: Mr Oh suggested that ticketing agencies could hold on to the revenue from selling tickets on behalf of an organiser until an event is over.\nFor instance, ticketing agency Sistic typically transfers ticket proceeds to the event organiser\u2019s bank account within 10 working days of the successful completion of an event.\nHowever, refund policies vary among ticketing websites.\nEventbrite allows organisers to set a no-refund policy. Meanwhile, Ticketmaster permits refunds if an event is cancelled. If the event is rescheduled, Ticketmaster can cancel the ticket order, subject to the event organiser\u2019s discretion, and issue a refund.\nIn 2014, Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan mooted the idea in Parliament that the Government could consider regulating concerts and events to ensure that ticket charges paid for by consumers are secured if the event is cancelled.\nResponding to Mr Lim, then Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong said the preferred approach is to push more on industry self-regulation and to raise consumer awareness, as most concert tickets are sold via Sistic, which has the practice of holding on to sales revenue."}
