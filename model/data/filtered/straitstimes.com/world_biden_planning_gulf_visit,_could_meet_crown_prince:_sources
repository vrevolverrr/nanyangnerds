It has previously rejected US requests to do so, remaining in compliance with an output agreement that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) reached with Russia and nine other producers.\nThe so-called Opec+ group has been unwinding record output cuts in place since 2020, as demand recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but not as fast as the West and other consumers want.\nMr Biden is aiming to participate in a Riyadh summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a regional union whose members are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sources said.\nThe goal would be to reactivate an annual summit between the US and the GCC that began during the presidency of Mr Barack Obama.\nBefore agreeing to the summit, Washington is looking for an extension of the Yemen truce and clarity on oil output by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, one source said.\nA two-month nationwide truce between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group, the first since 2016, expires on June 2.\nTwo senior US officials visited Saudi Arabia in May for talks that covered energy and other issues but did not include calls for boosting Saudi oil exports, the White House said at the time."}
