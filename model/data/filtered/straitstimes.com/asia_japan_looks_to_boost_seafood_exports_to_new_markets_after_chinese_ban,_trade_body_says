Scallops were the hardest-hit, dropping 37 per cent year on year.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t yet fully compensated for the loss from China in volume, but exports to the US, Canada, Thailand and Vietnam are increasing, significantly boosting momentum in alternative markets,\u201d said Mr Norihiko Ishiguro, chairman of Jetro.\nThe government-backed trade body is promoting the diversification of export destinations for scallops and other products impacted by China\u2019s curbs by establishing new commercial channels in Asia, the US and Europe, he added.\n\u201cOur intensive promotional efforts have enabled us to redirect 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the scallop exports lost due to China\u2019s import ban,\u201d Mr Ishiguro said on Aug 16, ahead of the first anniversary of the Fukushima water release on Aug 24.\n\u201cThere is significant growth potential for Japanese seafood exports... It won\u2019t take long to make up for the gap caused by China\u2019s ban,\u201d he added.\nJapan exported 87.1 billion yen (S$778 million) worth of aquatic products to China in 2022, making it the biggest market for Japanese exports, according to government data.\nThe figure, which includes pearl and coral, plunged to 61 billion yen in 2023 and 3.5 billion yen in the first half of 2024.\nWith an additional five billion yen budget from the government, Jetro has supported 170 events in the past year to promote scallops, yellowtail and other fish in more than 70 cities in Japan and abroad, including Davos, Switzerland and San Francisco, according to Mr Ishiguro and another Jetro official.\nIt has also invited renowned chefs, influencers and buyers from abroad to tour fish markets and fisheries in Japan, while campaigns in Thailand promoted Japanese seafood in non-Japanese restaurants like Thai, Italian and Chinese ones.\nMissions have been sent to Vietnam and Mexico to explore alternative processing sites for scallops, aiming to replace China\u2019s supply chain, Mr Ishiguro added.\nGrowth can be expected in emerging markets like Eastern Europe and the Middle East, he noted, pointing out that there are 2,000 Japanese restaurants in Poland alone.\nThe weak yen and the boom in Japan tourism are also contributing factors, he said, adding that there is no longer any reputational risk linked with Japanese seafood outside of China.
