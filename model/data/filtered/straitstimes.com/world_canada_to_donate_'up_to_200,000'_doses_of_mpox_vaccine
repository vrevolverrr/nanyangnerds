Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.\nAn outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.\nIt has spread from Congo to neighboring countries including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.\nCanada would not say to whom it would deliver the vaccines, or in what time frame.\n\"Canada is working closely with global health experts, including GAVI (the international vaccine alliance) and the WHO, to access the scope of the outbreak and identify how best to deliver vaccines as soon as possible to those who need them most,\" the government spokesperson wrote in an email. \"We will provide more details once a delivery timeline has been finalized.\"\nHealth Canada has previously refused to say how many mpox vaccine doses the country has \u201cfor national security reasons,\u201d saying only, \u201cCanada has secured sufficient supply of mpox vaccines to support provincial and territorial programmes for the prevention and control of mpox in Canada.\u201d\nBased on previous years\u2019 announcements from manufacturer Bavarian Nordic, Adam Houston, medical policy and advocacy adviser for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Canada, figures Canada has, at a conservative estimate, more than 2 million doses of mpox vaccine.\n\u201cWe'd like to see Canada first be more transparent about its own supplies and its own needs,\" Houston said before news of the donation was made public. \"And then we'd like to see transparency on its plans for what it's going to do with these vaccines. We think the priority is that vaccines should be shared.\u201d REUTERS"}
