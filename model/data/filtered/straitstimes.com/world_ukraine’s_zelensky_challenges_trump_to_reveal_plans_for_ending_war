In the televised debate last week, Trump decried the billions of dollars spent on Ukraine\u2019s defence, saying that Kyiv is \u201cnot winning the war\u201d.\nIn a nearly hour-long interview, the Ukrainian leader lamented the delays in weapons deliveries from Western allies and said he was \u201cpotentially ready\u201d to meet Trump to hear his team\u2019s proposals.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t plan my life and life of our people and our children,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the US, or will be all alone.\u201d\nThe Ukrainian leader has had a fraught relationship with Trump, who during his presidency consistently accused Mr Zelensky of corruption and soon after the former comedian\u2019s 2019 election leaned on him to investigate allegations against Mr Biden \u2013 a move that triggered his first impeachment.\nResponding to questions from Bloomberg on July 3, Mr Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, said the prospective Republican presidential candidate \u201cwill do what is necessary to restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage\u201d.\n\u201cHe is the only person who can make that happen,\u201d Mr Cheung said.\n\u2018A long, long, long wait\u2019\nMr Zelensky also challenged the notion that Kyiv is losing, refuting the term \u201cdeadlock\u201d to describe the conflict. He said Kyiv\u2019s forces are better positioned in terms of manpower than they were months ago and a new counteroffensive is a matter of arming its brigades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a deadlock, it\u2019s a problematic situation,\u201d he said. \u201cA deadlock means there\u2019s no way out. But a problem can be solved if one has the will and has the tools. We do have the will, and the tools \u2013 they haven\u2019t arrived yet.\u201d"}
