Analysts raised concerns that China could bypass US restrictions and buy equipment from other countries, rendering the sanctions less effective.\nUndersecretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez said on Thursday that America\u2019s allies had been consulted and knew about the export controls before they were announced.\n\u201cThey all know that we are expecting them to cover likewise. And we are working on those details with specific allies around the world,\u201d he said at an event held by Washington-based think-tank Centre for a New American Security.\nAsked what it would take to get other key players, particularly Japan and the Netherlands, to follow suit, he replied: \u201cWe expect to have a deal done in the near term.\u201d\nThe equipment needed to make advanced chips is supplied by a handful of companies from the US, Japan and the Netherlands, while most advanced chips are manufactured in Taiwan and South Korea.\nMr Estevez added that the deal could cover \u201cthe whole gamut\u201d and include chips and tools.\nThe rule also bans the sale of high-end chips to China if they are made with US equipment or technology, even if they are not produced in America.\nMr Estevez said he stressed the threat that China posed not only to America\u2019s national security, but that of other countries, when convincing them to join the US.\n\u201cWe shared that threat information with our allies,\u201d he said, adding it was advantageous for some countries for the US to take the lead in confronting China.\n\u201cIn some regards, I think some of those countries like us to be \u2018the bad guy\u2019, versus them doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially for countries in that neighbourhood, they understand the (China) threat.\u201d\nMr Estevez also said there could be more export controls to come in other areas of technology, with quantum computing, biotechnology and artificial intelligence on his radar.\nBut, he added, his goal was to protect America\u2019s national security and not wreak the \u201ceconomic destruction of China\u201d.\n\u201cWe are not looking at a decoupling. That is not what our focus is,\u201d he said."}
