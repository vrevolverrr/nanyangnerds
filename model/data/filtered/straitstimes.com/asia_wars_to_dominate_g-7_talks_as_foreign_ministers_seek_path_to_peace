But I think diplomacy is crucial,\u201d Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Reuters ahead of the three-day gathering that he will chair. \u201cOur international position is very clear... We are united. This is crucial.\u201d\nBut having a unified position has not been enough to bring peace to either Ukraine or the Middle East.\nThe Israelis have resisted repeated calls to halt their Gaza offensive, while in Ukraine the momentum on the battlefield has shifted in Russia\u2019s favour, with the West seemingly incapable of providing Kyiv with the weaponry it desperately needs.\nMr Tajani said it was crucial for Ukraine to keep the Russians at bay, adding that both Nato head Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba would be in Capri to discuss the conflict.\n\u201cIf there is a defeat of Ukraine, it\u2019s impossible to achieve an agreement. Defeat is not a good bridge for peace. For this we need to back Ukraine. But the final goal is peace. Peace with justice. Justice, Russia, outside Ukraine,\u201d Mr Tajani said, speaking in English.\nRussian money\nHighlighting that the West alone could not bring sufficient pressure on Russia to end the war, Mr Tajani said it was essential to involve China. \u201cIf you want to achieve peace, we need also Chinese engagement. The Chinese are friends of Russia,\u201d he said.\nAs Ukraine finances buckle under the weight of the war, the US has proposed that the G-7 look at ways of utilising some US$300 billion (S$410 billion) of sovereign Russian assets held in the West to help Kyiv.\nDiplomatic sources say the US, Canada and Britain want the assets to be seized, but that European Union nations are reluctant to do so because it would set a dangerous legal precedent.\n\u201cAt the political level we are not against (this). But I think we need to study if it\u2019s possible,\u201d said Tajani. \u201cWithout a legal basis, it would be a mistake to move on.\u201d\nA final decision is expected to be taken by the full G-7 leaders\u2019 summit in the southern region of Puglia in June.\nThe opening session of the meeting on the evening of April 17 will focus on Gaza and Iran, with the situation in the Red Sea under discussion on the morning of April 18. Before turning to Ukraine, the ministers will look at ways of reinforcing ties with Africa.\nRome has made Africa a priority for its year at the helm of the G-7 presidency, saying developing economic well-being across the continent is vital to prevent mass migration towards Europe in the years ahead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake to look at Africa (through) European glasses. We need to look at Africa with African glasses. We need to work together. They are friends. They are not under us,\u201d said Mr Tajani.\nThe final session on the morning of April 19 is earmarked for talks on Asia.\n\u201cWe are for the status quo in China, in Taipei (Taiwan). We want peace,\u201d said the Italian minister. REUTERS"}
