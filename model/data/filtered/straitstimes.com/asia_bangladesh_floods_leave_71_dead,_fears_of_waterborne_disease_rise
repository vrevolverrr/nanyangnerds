Nearly 500 medical teams were helping to provide treatment, with the army, air force, navy and the border guard assisting in relief efforts.\nThe authorities are now focusing on preventing the spread of waterborne diseases, a common aftermath of such disasters, and ensuring the availability of clean drinking water.\nThe Directorate General of Health Services said nearly 5,000 people had been hospitalised over the past 24 hours for cases of diarrhoea, skin infections and snake bites.\nHeavy rain in the capital Dhaka on Sept 3 swamped many districts, submerging roads in knee-deep to waist-high water, causing massive traffic jams as vehicles struggled through waterlogged streets.\nCrops worth US$282 million (S$369 million) have been damaged, affecting more than 1.4 million farmers, according to a preliminary assessment by the Agriculture Ministry.\nIn response to the crisis, the Singapore Government announced on Sept 8 that it would contribute US$100,000 (S$130,000) as seed money to support the Singapore Red Cross\u2019 public fundraising efforts.\n\u201cThe contribution will support humanitarian relief efforts and the immediate needs of affected communities,\u201d the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\nA 2015 analysis by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh were at risk of annual river flooding, which has only increased in recent years due to climate change.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef) has said two million children are at risk from Bangladesh\u2019s most severe flooding in three decades.\nUnicef has launched an urgent appeal for US$35 million to provide essential supplies to those affected.\n\u201cYear after year, the lives of millions of children in Bangladesh are being devastated by floods, heatwaves and cyclones. Climate change is clearly altering children\u2019s lives,\u201d said Ms Emma Brigham, deputy representative of Unicef Bangladesh. REUTERS"}
