The others remain under investigation, it said.\nSECO did not name the sectors involved, nor the individual companies subject to investigation.\nSwitzerland said earlier this year it had set up a specialist team to investigate and enforce sanctions that Bern imposed following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
