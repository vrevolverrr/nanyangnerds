Quaint houses were reduced to rubble. A field near the town's church had become a mass grave.\nNow, as Ukrainian and international prosecutors begin the work of identifying those responsible for the alleged atrocities, Reuters has examined the aftermath of Russia's hasty retreat - and found vital clues to the identities of individual Russian soldiers and military units present during the bloody occupation.\nAmong them: An elite paramilitary force that reports up to a former bodyguard of President Vladimir Putin. A paratroop division decorated for its role in Moscow's long secret war in east Ukraine. Chechen troops linked to the strongman leader of the Russian region. And a paratrooper who was traced thanks to a love letter found in the ruins.\nReuters journalists spent three weeks in Bucha interviewing more than 90 residents, reviewing photographic and video evidence these locals shared and examining documents left behind by the Russians.\nMuch of the evidence and testimony focused on Yablunska Street, a 4.5km thoroughfare whose name means Apple Tree Street.\nIt was here on Bucha's southern edge that bodies of civilians were left in the open. Many details about the occupying force and the chain of command are reported here for the first time.\nAsked about Russia's military operation in Bucha, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov replied: \"The Bucha story is a set-up and a fake. For details, you need to approach the Defence Ministry.\"\nNeither the ministry nor Russia's military responded to questions from Reuters.\nServicemen from Russia's Vityaz security force were among the occupying troops, an identity document found at the scene showed.\nVityaz, whose presence in Bucha is revealed here for the first time, is under the command of the National Guard, Rosgvardiya.\nIts boss, Mr Viktor Zolotov, who didn't comment for this article, is a former Putin bodyguard and reports directly to the Russian President.\nOther documents, including a love letter found in one house that was occupied by Russian soldiers, helped place in Bucha the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, a paratrooper force from Pskov in north-west Russia.\nReuters reporting has for the first time independently linked this division to acts of violence against unarmed men.\nEarlier, in 2014, Mr Putin decorated the 76th for carrying out combat missions when Russia was fighting a clandestine war in eastern Ukraine.\nOn a visit to the division's base in 2020, Mr Putin told them: \"Our people are proud of you.\"\nThe division comes under Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, a close Putin ally who has vacationed with the president.\nNeither the Defence Ministry nor Mr Shoigu responded to Reuters questions.\nBy interviewing dozens of witnesses, analysing social media posts, and using open-source intelligence techniques to match video to the locations where it was shot, Reuters discovered that at least three Chechen units allied to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, another fervent Putin supporter, were operating in the vicinity of Bucha during March.\nWitnesses said they saw Chechen troops inside Bucha itself. Chechen authorities didn't respond to questions about their forces' activities in the area.\nReacting to reports of the more than 400 deaths in Bucha, US President Joe Biden denounced Mr Putin as a \"war criminal.\" The Kremlin condemned Mr Biden's remarks as \"unforgivable.\"\nIt denied its forces committed atrocities and has claimed that images of dead bodies on Bucha's streets are fake.\nRussia characterises its invasion as a special operation to demilitarise and \"denazify\" Ukraine.\nUkrainian prosecutors say they are investigating more than 9,000 potential war crimes by Russian forces in the conflict and pursuing hundreds of suspects. The International Criminal Court is also examining potential human rights abuses in the war.\nUkraine's prosecutor-general announced in April she had identified 10 Russian soldiers suspected of committing abuses against civilians in Bucha.\nIn response to a request for comment, the office of Ukraine's prosecutor-general referred Reuters to the district prosecutor for Bucha, who said that more than 120 law enforcement officers had already conducted interviews with over 1,400 witnesses and victims in the town.\nThe prosecutor said 323 criminal proceedings were currently under investigation.\n'Serving the motherland'\nBefore war came to Ukraine, Bucha was a quiet, desirable suburb for young, well-off families.\nWithin days of the invasion, Bucha and the surrounding towns became an epicentre of fighting as Russian forces advanced on the capital, Kyiv.\nHostomel airport just outside Bucha was an early strategic target for the Russians.\nOn Feb 27, Ukrainian shells destroyed a column of Russian tanks in Bucha. Starting on March 3, more Russian soldiers arrived in the town, local residents said, rolling along Yablunska Street in tanks branded with the white Z that has become a symbol of the offensive.\nThey set up camp in a sprawling industrial complex with a plant for repairing agricultural machinery at one end and a glassworks factory at the other.\nSoldiers picked the nicest houses along the street to occupy and ordered residents to stay indoors.\nOn March 3, dozens of soldiers in armoured vehicles rammed down Mr Vitalii Zhyvotovskyi's fence and commandeered his home in a particularly beautiful side street off Yablunska.\nFor the next seven days, the 50-year-old engineer said he was forced to share his house with nearly 30 Russian soldiers, who turned his home and a neighbouring house into their quarters.\nMr Zhyvotovskyi, his 20-year-old daughter and neighbour stayed in a room in Mr Zhyvotovskyi's basement.\nBeneath these papers, Mr Zhyvotovskyi said he found a letter addressed to a soldier named Aleksandr Logvinenko, later identified by Reuters as a paratrooper from Pskov.\nMs Oksana Rybakova, who wrote the letter, called Logvinenko her \"soldier\".\nIn the hand-written letter, Ms Rybakova worried about Logvinenko's safety, and asked; \"What's it like there?\"\n\"It's good you are close, close in my heart, but you are far, serving our Motherland, protecting us. I'm proud of you!\" Ms Rybakova wrote, kissing the bottom of the letter and leaving an imprint of her lipstick.\nReuters traced Ms Rybakova in the Pskov region of Russia, where the 76th Guards Air Assault Division is based.\nThe division is known in Russia for a fierce battle it fought two decades ago against Chechen rebels in which it lost hundreds of men.\nContacted by phone twice in April, Ms Rybakova said Logvinenko was her partner and that she sent the letter. Two people who know Ms Rybakova confirmed that she and Logvinenko were a couple.\nLogvinenko served in the paratroops, Ms Rybakova said, and had been away from home for weeks on a military assignment.\nShe didn't say which unit he was in. Logvinenko didn't respond to messages sent to him by Reuters.\nIn a conversation shortly before publication, Ms Rybakova changed her account and said Logvinenko was not her partner.\nIn a bedroom of a neighbouring house, which Mr Zhyvotovskyi said was occupied by the same group of Russian soldiers, someone had spray-painted onto a wall \"Wolf-68\".\nThe number 68 designates Tambov region, south of Moscow, on car registration plates.\nReuters identified a Russian man named Kirill Kryuchkov, who uses variations of \"Wolf-68\" as his handle on social media.\nKryuchkov is originally from Tambov and now lives in Pskov.\nTwo people who know Kryuchkov told Reuters that he served in the 234th Air Assault Regiment.\nThe regiment is part of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division. One of the people said Kryuchkov had been in Ukraine.\nKryuchkov posted three videos on his Instagram account on April 19 that showed uniformed soldiers in a bar, in a location Reuters couldn't identify, drinking beer and smoking a hookah.\nOne soldier had a paratrooper patch on his arm. A second had a patch with the letter Z that is a symbol for Russia's war.\nReuters contacted another friend of Kryuchkov, Mr Vitaly Shcherbakov, who posted many photos on his VKontakte social media account where he and Kryuchkov are wearing paratrooper uniforms.\nMr Shcherbakov declined to talk about Kryuchkov, but said: \"You can write: 'F*** the Ukies',\" using a derogatory term for Ukrainians.\nKryuchkov did not reply to a message from Reuters seeking his comment.\nReuters found other evidence of the presence of paratroopers from the 76th Guards Air Assault Division.\nA document that a resident recovered from a pile of abandoned mortar cases on Bucha's Vodoprovidna Street stated that the mortars had been checked by officers from unit 74268.\nThe resident showed Reuters a photograph he took of the document. Unit 74268 is based in Pskov, according to a database of Russian legal entities.\nThe unit's registered address is part of the same military complex in Pskov that houses the headquarters of the 76th Division.\nAnother resident provided Reuters with a list of radio call signs found on Vokzalna Street.\nThe document said the call signs - unique code designations for radio transmissions - were used by the 104th Air Assault Regiment, which is also part of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, according to the Russian Defence Ministry's website.\nRussia's military didn't respond to questions about the 76th.\nBlood-stained headquarters\nIn early March, around the same time soldiers invaded Mr Zhyvotovskyi's home, Russian troops occupied a brick office building at 144 Yablunska Street that usually housed small businesses in the area.\nNearly 90 residents had been sheltering from the war in the building's large basement since fighting erupted.\nFrom their bunker, they could hear the sound of footsteps and hammers above them as Russian soldiers fortified the building.\nOther soldiers were going door to door along Yablunska Street, rounding up men of military age, other residents recalled.\nOne man, who goes by the name Slavik, said he was brought to the courtyard in front of the brick building on March 4, undressed and forced to kneel with his arms bound behind him.\nAs Mr Slavik crouched down onto the ground next to four other captives, he said he saw the body of a young man who had just been killed.\nMr Slavik and another eyewitness later identified the dead man as Mr Vitalii Karpenko, a construction worker who'd recently volunteered for the Territorial Defence Force, a local militia made up of Ukrainian civilians formed shortly before the Russian invasion.\nRussian soldiers disappeared as quickly as they arrived.\nAfter the troops left at the end of March, a gruesome video surfaced on social media.\nIt showed eight bodies dumped next to the Russian headquarters.\nThe background of the video, examined by Reuters, matches the area of the building where an official mortuary document says the remains were found.\nMs Olena Shyhan, a 31-year-old who works in a food market in Kyiv, was Mr Karpenko's girlfriend.\nShe had lost touch with him in the early days of the war, and recognised him among the bodies in the widely viewed video.\n\"He didn't do any harm to anybody,\" Ms Shyhan said.\nThe couple had been planning to move in together this summer and hoping to have a child.\n\"We were just starting our life together. We had so many plans,\" she said.\nThe building that had served as the soldiers' headquarters was in disarray when Reuters visited in April. Inside the first-floor hall was a blood-covered bullet casing next to a trail of blood.\nOutside, members of the National Guard of Ukraine, responsible for public security, were packing up discarded boxes of Russian ammunition and gas masks into their truck.\nThey showed Reuters a Russian identification card they said they had just picked up inside.\nThe card certified that its holder had completed a course in using telecoms equipment.\nIt was issued on Dec 7, 2021 to a Corporal Konstantin Vladimirovich Korshunov, and identified him as a member of military unit No. 3179, which belongs to Russia's Vityaz security force.\nVityaz is part of the National Guard, Rosgvardiya, that reports to Mr Putin's former bodyguard Zolotov.\nHe was put on a US sanctions list in March for his force's alleged role in suppressing dissent in occupied areas of Ukraine and cracking down on Russians who oppose the war.\nRussia has cast such western sanctions as a hostile act.\nBy cross-referencing details on the identification card with social media profiles and publicly available databases, Reuters established that Korshunov is a 23-year-old originally from Penza, 625km south-east of Moscow.\nTwo people from Penza who know Korshunov confirmed that he is in active service in Rosgvardiya, and one of them said he serves in unit No. 3179, part of Vityaz.\nThey said he was away on a work trip. Reuters contacted Korshunov, but he didn't respond.\nVityaz is elite and highly-trained. It played a role in a major episode of Mr Putin's early presidency: When Chechen rebels took the audience hostage at Moscow's Nord Ost theatre in 2002, Vityaz was sent in to help end the siege.\nMore than 100 of the 700 people inside the theatre died, many in part from the effect of gas that Russian security forces pumped into the building to incapacitate the hostage takers, an official Russian investigation concluded.\nThe head of the Bucha district prosecutor's office, Mr Ruslan Kravchenko, told Reuters that Rosgvardiya service personnel were in Bucha.\nRosgvardiya did not respond to Reuters questions about Vityaz's presence in the town, and there was no answer on any of the phone numbers listed for Vityaz.\nNear the Russian troops' headquarters building on Yablunska, local residents said a mysterious commander arrived in mid-March, taking over one of the nicest houses on the block.\nThe commander, who locals nicknamed \"Long\" for his tall and lanky appearance, stayed until near the end of the occupation.\nTwo residents said the commander always turned his face when locals were nearby to avoid being seen.\nHe also threatened through his guards to kill anyone who saw his face, the residents said.\nThe commander worked in the headquarters building. He had round-the-clock security, and his guards told locals even they feared him, residents said.\nThere was more violence under the commander's tenure and residents were forbidden from burying the dead, they said.\nReuters has not been able to ascertain the commander's identity, or that of his guards and unit.\n\"Akhmat is our strength\"\nThroughout this time, Chechen fighters were operating in and around Bucha.\nChechen forces loyal to the region's ruler Ramzan Kadyrov have a fearsome reputation.\nUnited Nations human rights rapporteurs, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have accused Chechen fighters of extrajudicial killings, abductions, torture and illegal detention inside Chechnya.\nKadyrov has denied violating human rights and said Western intelligence agencies are inventing the allegations.\nOutside the village of Lubianka, about 13km north of Bucha, members of Ukraine's Territorial Defence Forces showed Reuters a house where they said Chechen troops had stayed.\nOn one of the doors was written in Russian: \"Akhmat is our strength!\"\nThis was a reference to Akhmat Kadyrov, Chechnya's former leader and Ramzan's father.\nThree Lubianka residents said the Chechen soldiers wore sand-coloured uniforms that looked newer and of better quality than the olive-green uniforms worn by other Russian troops.\nOne resident said he could identify the Chechens because they wore \"beautiful\" uniforms, some with the face of Kadyrov embroidered on their chests.\nAnother resident said the men were bearded, unlike other Russian troops, and had Chechen flag patches on their uniforms.\nSome of the Chechens posted videos of themselves on social media. They did not disclose their location.\nBut Reuters was able to establish they were in the Bucha area by analysing the videos and interviewing witnesses.\nThe Chechen regional government didn't respond to Reuters questions for this article.\nIn a video posted to Telegram on Feb 26, a Chechen commander, Hussein Mezhidov, is seen at an unnamed location that Reuters matched to Hostomel, about 5km north of Bucha, by analysing street signs in the background.\nA video posted to YouTube on March 4 shows another Chechen commander, Anzor Bisayev, driving through a bombed-out street that Reuters matched to Borodyanka, a town 25km west of Bucha, by comparing the skyline.\nBisayev, too, voices praise for Chechen leader Kadyrov's father: \"Akhmat is our strength,\" he says in the video.\nReuters verified the two commanders' identities against other known images.\nA March 22 video that Kadyrov posted on his Telegram channel shows a unit led by Chechen commander Rayan Dokashev in an undisclosed location.\nIn an accompanying post on Telegram, Kadyrov referred to Dokashev as \"our brother\".\nReuters matched the background in one shot of the video to Lenin Street in Borodyanka.\nReuters was not able to establish whether the units led by Bisayev, Dokashev or Mezhidov, were present in Bucha. But five eyewitnesses told Reuters Chechen fighters were operating in the town.\nFrom his house on the corner of Yablunska Street, Mr Volodymyr Abramov said he watched as Chechen troops drove their column into town on March 4.\nMr Abramov, 72, who moved to Bucha after helping to clean up the radiological debris from the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, lived next door to his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleh, 40, a welder.\nThe next day, March 5, Chechen soldiers arrived at their door, Mr Abramov said.\nThey wore sandy-coloured uniforms and expensive nubuck boots, and carried neater, better kit than regular Russian forces, Mr Abramov said, matching the description of Chechen fighters given by residents north of the town.\nThe Chechens ordered Mr Abramov, Iryna and Oleh to step outside with their hands raised.\nOne of the soldiers repeatedly asked Iryna where the \"Nazis\" were hiding, she said, and set their house ablaze.\nRussian propaganda has described Ukraine's rulers as Nazi sympathisers, a label Kyiv rejects.\nWhile Iryna was being questioned, other soldiers in the unit ordered her husband to take off his shirt. They brought him, naked from the waist up, out of the property into the cold street outside.\nMr Abramov said he heard Oleh asking the soldiers not to harm him.\nThe soldiers forced Oleh to kneel, Abramov said. Then they shot him in the temple.\nBlood was still pulsing from the wound when Iryna reached her husband's body. \"Kill me too,\" she shouted at the soldiers.\nWhen the Russian forces retreated in late March, Oleh's body was one of more than a dozen left behind on Yablunska Street.\nIn April, Iryna and her father gave Oleh a funeral and finally buried him in a family plot in Bucha.\nKneeling by the freshly covered grave on a misty day in April, Iryna stroked a picture of her husband that rested against a blue and yellow wreath, the colours of the Ukrainian flag."}
