Though he believed he had support from a majority of states, he opted to shelve the discussions until July 2025 \u2013 a proposal that was not approved either.\nDeep sea mining in international waters involves scraping the ocean floor for minerals like nickel, cobalt and copper, crucial for renewable energy technology.\nUnder the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the ISA is responsible for protecting the seabed in areas beyond national jurisdictions, and overseeing any exploration or exploitation of resources in those zones.\nDeep sea mining has not yet taken place beyond the experimental and exploratory stage.\nThe ISA\u2019s Council, which for now grants only exploration contracts, has been drawing up commercial exploitation rules for more than a decade. It is aiming to adopt a mining code in 2025.\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) and scientists warn that deep sea mining could damage habitats and harm species that are little understood, but are potentially important to the food chain.\nIn addition, they point to the risk of disrupting the ocean\u2019s capacity to absorb carbon emitted by human activities, and the noise that could disturb species such as whales.\nHowever, multiple countries have lined up exploratory contracts and pursued tests.\nNauru, a tiny Pacific island country, has successfully pushed the ISA to allow exploitation applications to be submitted, even in the absence of a mining code.\nThe clock is ticking as Canada\u2019s The Metals Company \u2013 an industry giant \u2013 and Nauru Ocean Resources (Nori), its subsidiary, move forward with plans to harvest mineral-rich \u201cpolymetallic nodules\u201d in the Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone in the Pacific.\nAn application from the Nauru government on behalf of Nori to start commercial mining is being prepared for submission to the ISA.\n\u201cThe responsible development of deep sea minerals is not just an opportunity for Nauru and other small island developing states,\u201d Nauru President David Adeang said earlier this week. \u201cIt is a necessity for our survival in a rapidly changing world.\u201d\nMore than 30 countries have called for a moratorium on deep sea mining, including France, Canada, Chile, Brazil and Britain.\nA new study published in July showed that the mineral-rich nodules that mining companies wish to harvest from the ocean floor produce oxygen.\nThe groundbreaking study was the first instance of the production of oxygen by non-living sources, and without sunlight.\n\u201cPublic demand and political support for stopping deep sea mining from harming the oceans has never been stronger,\u201d Ms Louisa Casson, a campaigner with international NGO Greenpeace, told AFP.\n\u201cWith the threat of a company applying to mine the oceans hanging over us all, it\u2019s clear that we need far greater urgency from governments at the ISA to turn these words into action.\u201d"}
