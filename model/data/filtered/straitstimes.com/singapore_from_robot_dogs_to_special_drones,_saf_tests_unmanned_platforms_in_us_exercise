The Singapore Army is currently trialling it as part of Exercise Forging Sabre in Idaho, to give soldiers an edge before they conduct urban operations.\nCaptain Loy Yong Wei, from the Singapore Armed Forces\u2019 (SAF) Sense and Strike Accelerator Centre in Headquarters 6th Singapore Division, said the robot dogs are a \u201cviable solution\u201d for complex terrain and highly urbanised landscapes.\n\u201cThey are able to do terrain confirmation as well as some target detection autonomously without us actually having boots on the ground,\u201d said the 26-year-old lead officer for the project.\nThrough the use of light detection and ranging sensors, these robot dogs can create 3D models and maps of the terrain, which better inform soldiers of what to expect.\nAt the same time, the robot dog ensures the soldiers\u2019 safety, said Mr Bryan Ng, 35, who heads the capability development of unmanned ground vehicles at DSTA.\n\u201cIf it does detect a threat, then actually, its job is done. If it gets shot, it\u2019s done its duty already... that\u2019s why we use robots for this, not humans,\u201d he said.\nAdding to the army\u2019s threat-detection capabilities is the use of micro UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), which was demonstrated by reconnaissance troops from the 11C4I battalion.\nOne soldier is able to operate multiple small drones via a tablet.\nThrough pre-planned flight routes, the drones are able to scan the battlefield, and have the captured footage processed via a computer through the use of algorithms to automatically identify targets, ranging from vehicles to weapon systems.\nMembers of the Singapore media were given a demonstration last Friday (Saturday Singapore time), where a single soldier \u2013 flanked by four others ready to take manual control of each drone if the need arose \u2013 activated four drones.\nWhile these unmanned platforms are used to aid troops on the ground, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is also testing its own set of drones, designed to provide feedback for the command post to facilitate its decision-making.\nThese drones are significantly larger \u2013 about the size of a lorry tyre \u2013 and instead of flying on pre-planned routes, they can autonomously scan the battlefield according to set parameters.\nCaptain Lim Ryan, 30, who is part of the RSAF\u2019s drone swarm project, said the drones work in tandem with other RSAF UAVs which are flying at higher altitudes.\nThe swarm terminology used in relation to the drones does not refer to their quantity, but to the algorithm developed for them to operate autonomously.\n\u201cFor example, if we give them a large area, they will segregate it, and they will go about their own searches within these areas,\u201d he said.\nInformation is relayed to the command post, which can then decide the best course of action to take out the remaining threats.\nAlthough the media was shown only four of the drones during a demonstration of their capabilities, there is potential for greater numbers of them to be used in the battlefield, said Capt Lim.\n\u201c(The algorithm) is scalable... whether we deploy it on one, four or 20 drones, they should act the same way.\u201d"}
