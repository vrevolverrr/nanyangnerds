So this is a way of performing community surveillance.\"\nSaid a 37-year-old resident who gave his name only as Mr Ang: \"The situation looks bad if we're getting tested so often, but I'm also appreciative of the steps that the authorities are taking to stop the virus' spread.\"\nThis time, residents of Block 506 were not the only ones in queue. In fact, when the mandatory testing exercise began for them at 9am on Friday, the block's residents were outnumbered by staff of shops in seven surrounding blocks.\nFree voluntary tests are being offered to residents of the seven blocks between Friday and June 17. They are - Block 511 Hougang Avenue 10; Blocks 681, 683 and 684 Hougang Avenue 8; Block 682 Hougang Avenue 4; and Blocks 685 and 698 Hougang Street 61.\nThe first case in the Block 506 cluster is a 57-year-old Malaysian woman who tested positive on May 15. Other than the 13 cases in the block, MOH had earlier reported that three cases linked to the Changi Airport Terminal 3 cluster were also residents of Block 506.\nMeanwhile, a McDonald's outlet in Block 684 was closed on May 27 after a rider who made deliveries from the outlet tested positive."}
