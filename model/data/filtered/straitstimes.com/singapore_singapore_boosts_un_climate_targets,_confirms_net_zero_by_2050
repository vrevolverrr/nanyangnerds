This five-million tonne improvement is significant. It is equivalent to reducing our current transport emissions by two-thirds.\u201d\nHe also said the public sector will commit to achieving net-zero emissions around 2045, while new developments within the Jurong Lake District will reach net-zero emissions around 2045 too.\nSingapore International Energy Week is one of the region\u2019s largest energy conferences, bringing together governments, industry, investors and academia. This year\u2019s event, the 15th time it has been held, is dominated by the global energy crisis and the need to speed up the transition to a greener and more secure energy future.\nMr Wong said Singapore has progressively cut its greenhouse gas emissions, achieving a reduction of 32 per cent below business-as-usual levels by 2020 to 52.8 million tonnes. This was double the 16 per cent reduction pledged in 2009, giving the Government the confidence to raise its climate ambition. He said achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will be a stretch target but a necessary one, and would involve electricity imports, solar energy, carbon offsets and other steps, such as hydrogen.\nHe also announced Singapore\u2019s ambitious programme to scale up low-carbon hydrogen investment and deployment, and said this will be a key part of meeting the nation\u2019s mid-century net-zero target.\nHe said that to enhance Singapore\u2019s energy security, \u201cwe must redouble efforts to green our energy sources because climate change is happening at an even faster pace\u201d.\n\u201cThe energy crisis and the climate crisis have become a vicious cycle. And the world cannot afford to choose between an energy crisis and a climate crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have energy security, we will need to resolve the climate crisis too.\u201d\nBut global success meant international collaboration under the 2015 United Nations Paris climate agreement. \u201cThe transition to net zero demands ambitious and collective action,\u201d he said in his opening address.\nThe revisions to Singapore\u2019s climate targets come two weeks before the start of the COP27 United Nations climate talks in Egypt. The annual talks bring together nearly 200 nations as well as business leaders and civil society, and are the main negotiating session for global climate diplomacy.\nAt last year\u2019s COP26 talks in Glasgow in Scotland, nations were asked to revisit and strengthen their 2030 targets by the end of this year. This was in recognition that collective global efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are still not enough to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a level climate scientists say should not be breached.\nThe world has already warmed 1.2 deg C since the mid-19th century.\nThe UN\u2019s climate science panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says limiting warming to around 1.5 deg C requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030. Last year, global emissions of CO2, the main greenhouse gas, reached another peak.\nWhile Singapore is strengthening its 2030 target, its emissions will still grow before starting to fall towards the end of this decade to reach net zero by 2050. Net zero means any residual emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, such as aviation or some industrial processes, will be removed by buying carbon offsets or using technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere.\nIn response to questions, A National Climate Change Secretariat spokesman noted Singapore\u2019s emissions were still growing, but said: \u201cUnlike other cities or countries that have abundant access to alternative energy sources like wind, nuclear and hydropower, Singapore\u2019s geography and small land area hamper our ability to harness alternative energy.\u201d\n\u201cIn addition, Singapore also has a significant industry sector that many Singaporeans are employed in, which contributes significantly to Singapore\u2019s economy. An abrupt transition will be disruptive to the economy and to citizens.\u201d\nThe spokesman said And many of Singapore\u2019s decarbonisation options this decade, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage and electricity imports, were contingent on technological maturity and effective international cooperation.\nThe spokesman added that Singapore is committed to bending its emissions curve this decade.\nAmong the steps to cut Singapore\u2019s emissions are solar panels on roofs and reservoirs, setting a zero-growth policy for cars and motorcycles, and raising the carbon tax progressively from the current $5 a tonne to around $50 to $80 a tonne by 2030.\nProfessor Koh Lian Pin, a Nominated MP and director of the National University of Singapore\u2019s Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, said: \u201cThis announcement is timely, given that Parliament will (in November) be debating the changes to the law on carbon pricing in Singapore, which is a key way to get large emitters here to reduce their emissions.\n\u201cIt is also heartening to know that Singapore is interested in tapping carbon markets to achieve our climate goals. With deforestation being a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, conserving nature through high-quality carbon projects can help to turn off the tap of emissions while helping to draw down the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\u201d\nMs Melissa Low, a research fellow at the centre, said the Republic is one of only about 20 countries, including COP27 host Egypt, as well as Australia, Indonesia and India, to have updated their 2030 climate targets since the Glasgow gathering.\nShe called the decision commendable but expressed some concern because Singapore\u2019s emissions are still growing.\n\u201cConsidering that the Singapore Parliament has declared climate change to be a global emergency, an increase in emissions trajectory to peak earlier, is still worrying.\u201d"}
