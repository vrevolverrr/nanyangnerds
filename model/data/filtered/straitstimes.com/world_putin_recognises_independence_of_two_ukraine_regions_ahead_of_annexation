But the threats have not deterred a sweeping Ukrainian counter-offensive, which has been pushing back Russian troops in the east and is on the doorstep of the Donetsk region town of Lyman, which Moscow\u2019s forces pummelled for weeks before capturing it this summer.\nThe Kremlin-installed leaders of the four regions that pleaded to Mr Putin for annexation this week were gathered in the Russian capital on Thursday ahead of the ceremony. Their nearly simultaneous requests came after they claimed that residents unanimously backed the move in hastily organised referendums that were dismissed by Kyiv and the West as illegal, fraudulent and void.\nUkraine said the only appropriate response from the West was to hit Russia with more sanctions and to supply Ukrainian forces with more weapons to keep reclaiming territory.\nPresident Joe Biden said on Thursday that \u201cthe United States will never, never, never recognise Russia\u2019s claims on Ukraine sovereign territory\u201d.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also rejected the annexation plans, condemning them as \u201ca dangerous escalation\u201d that \u201chas no place in the modern world\u201d."}
