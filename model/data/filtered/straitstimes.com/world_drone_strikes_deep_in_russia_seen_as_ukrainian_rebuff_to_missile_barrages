On Tuesday, a third Russian airfield in Kursk, which lies closer to Ukraine, was set ablaze in another drone strike.\nMilitary analysts saw the attacks as Kyiv\u2019s response to Russia on the same day that Moscow conducted another wave of missile strikes on critical infrastructure in Ukraine.\nIt remains to be seen whether Russia seeks to retaliate; it unleashed the first wave of its bombardment campaign shortly after an attack on a key bridge leading to annexed Crimea that it said was organised by Ukrainian military intelligence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bigger image blow than a military one,\u201d said Mr Oleh Zhdanov, a military analyst based in Kyiv.\n\u201cIt means there are no sites in western Russia that are out of Ukraine\u2019s reach.\u201d\nThe damage to the warplanes sparked renewed grumbling among Russia\u2019s military bloggers, whose social media posts can provide a window into the mood in Russia on the course of the war unleashed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\u201cAnd I, a naive civilian fool, thought that planes were kept under concrete shelters during war.., no?\u201c wrote Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky.\n\u201cIt turns out that small drones, the danger from which was so neglected, can attack strategic aircraft.\u201d\n\u2018Asymmetrical response\u2019\nAnalysts said it was unclear why Russia\u2019s sophisticated air defences had failed to spot the threat and nullify it, if indeed Kyiv did use an old Tupolev reconnaissance drone.\n\u201cIt would be visible on radars: the question arises of how this drone could fly from Ukraine through Russian territory and not be visible to S-400 units and hit strategic bombers at a military site,\u201d said Mr Oleksandr Musiyenko, another Kyiv analyst.\n\u201cWe could conclude that Russian air defences cannot guarantee the protection of their strategic aerodromes and that they effectively admit this,\u201d he said.\nA senior Western official told Reuters that if Kyiv was behind the drone strikes, \u201cit does show that they can operate in Russia at will, and that will deeply worry the Russians\u201d.\nWestern officials said they were confident that it was at the Engels base that Russia kept its strategic long-range bombers, but that now it would have to think of moving them.\n\u201cIt may have the effect of pushing those bombers into dispersed locations,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cIt certainly makes the Russians less confident... (that) anywhere is safe.\u201d\nIt was not the first time Russia accused Ukraine of using such drones for attacks inside its borders.\nThe Defence Ministry in Moscow said Ukraine used Tupolev Tu-143 drones laden with explosives in July to conduct strikes in the southern Russian regions of Belgorod and Kursk that border on Ukraine."}
