Singapore on track to relaxing restrictions after June 13\nBarring another superspreader event or big cluster, the nation should be on track to bringing the current outbreak under control and easing tightened restrictions after June 13, PM Lee said.\nHe noted that the number of daily cases has come down, thanks to the support of Singaporeans, and that the authorities should know for sure \"in a week or so\".\nIf the Covid-19 situation continues to improve and the number of community cases falls further, Singapore should be able to relax restrictions, he added. In the meantime, he called on everyone to keep up their efforts, remain vigilant, work from home if possible, and go out only if necessary.\nThose who are unwell should see a doctor immediately, even if they have been vaccinated, said PM Lee.\nRead full story here.\n2. DIY Covid-19 test kits to be sold at pharmacies\nSelf-administered test kits for the coronavirus, which will be less uncomfortable than regular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests and easier to use, will soon be available for purchase over the counter at pharmacies, said PM Lee.\nHe said such kits will be useful for front-line workers who want to test themselves frequently or for anyone else who is concerned about being infected.\nThese are just some of the many alternatives to PCR tests being rolled out or evaluated here, including antigen rapid tests (ARTs), saliva tests, breathalysers and wastewater surveillance.\nThis is in line with Singapore's strategy to test faster, and more liberally and extensively, to quickly detect Covid-19 cases and isolate them and ring-fence their contacts promptly before the virus spreads further.\nRead full story here.\n3. Routine testing to be carried out in work, social and other normal settings\nThe authorities will routinely and regularly test people who appear well, in normal work, social or community settings, said PM Lee.\nThe wider testing is in response to the virus mutating to become more transmissible.\nPM Lee noted that rostered routine testing (RRT) is already being carried out in a number of higher-risk settings such as migrant worker dormitories, construction worksites, shipyards, air and sea ports, hospitals and nursing homes.\nWith faster and cheaper tests available, it can be done at more workplaces, such as offices, restaurants and shopping malls.\nThose whose occupations involve close contact with many people and could result in superspreading events - such as taxi drivers, performers, masseurs and educators - could be tested more regularly.\nExtensive testing will give Singapore the confidence to resume larger-scale gatherings, PM Lee said, adding that routine, large-scale, fast and simple testing is expected to be part of the new normal.\nRead full story here.\n4. Household members of close contacts of Covid-19 cases to be isolated\nPM Lee said past experience has shown that an infected person is quite likely to infect others who live in the same household.\nIn future, household members of those identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case will also be told to isolate themselves, instead of waiting to see if the close contact tests positive.\nIf the close contact later tests negative, the household members can be safely released from isolation, but if the result is positive, the authorities will have saved precious time by isolating the household members earlier, said PM Lee.\nThis more aggressive approach is intended to help shut down clusters more quickly, even as Singapore continues to improve its contact tracing operations.\nRead full story here.\n5. Faster vaccine deliveries to come, vaccination for students to begin on June 1\nPM Lee announced that Singapore has received further confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months.\nThe latest supply schedule will allow the country to further boost its vaccination programme, and offer the vaccine to everyone sooner than expected.\nThose 60 and above can now walk into any vaccination centre and get vaccinated without an appointment.\nThe next group to be vaccinated will be students, PM Lee said, noting that the latest outbreak has had more cases of children getting infected in schools and tuition centres.\nBookings will open on June 1, with priority given to graduating cohorts for O, N and A levels, as well as special needs students.\nOther students aged 12 and above will be next, including students in institutions of higher learning.\nAfter Singapore has vaccinated students, it will move on to vaccinate the final remaining group, young adults aged 39 and younger, around mid-June, PM Lee said.\nNoting that this group is quite large, he said the Singaporeans among them will be given a two-week priority window to book their appointments first, before the Government opens it up to the rest who want to be vaccinated.\nRead full story here.\n6. Singapore must prepare to live with Covid-19\nWhile the global pandemic will subside one day, PM Lee said, he does not expect Covid-19 to disappear.\nThe virus will become endemic and continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come, he added.\nThis means Singapore will see small outbreaks of the disease from time to time as well, and Singaporeans will have to learn to carry on with their lives even with the virus in their midst in this new normal.\nAt the same time, Covid-19 becoming endemic means Singapore has to stay connected to the world, with effective safeguards and border restrictions to keep Singaporeans safe, he said.\nWhile the country will not be able to prevent some infected people from slipping through from time to time, he said that as long as the population is mostly vaccinated, Singapore should be able to trace, isolate and treat the cases that pop up, and prevent a severe and disastrous outbreak.\nPM Lee envisioned a future where people in Singapore may take booster shots every year.\n\"We will get tested often, but it will be fast and easy,\" he said. \"We will go to work or school, meet friends and family, participate in religious services, and enjoy entertainment and sports events.\n\"We will reopen our borders safely. Visitors will again come to Singapore. Singaporeans will travel again to countries where the disease is well under control, especially if we have been vaccinated.\"\nEventually, PM Lee said, people will be able to go about without masks again, at least outdoors.\nWhile the country is still \"some ways off\" from this, he said it is heading in the right direction.\nRead full story here."}
