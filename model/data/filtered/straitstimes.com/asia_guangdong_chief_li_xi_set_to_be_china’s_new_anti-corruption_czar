He later spent four years in Shanghai and three years in Liaoning province before becoming party chief of Guangdong, an economic powerhouse.\nMr Li is believed to have close ties to President Xi Jinping. He used to be a former assistant to Mr Li Ziqi, a former Gansu party secretary who was close to Mr Xi\u2019s father Xi Zhongxun. It was through this connection that Mr Li Xi eventually became a close confidant of President Xi. While Mr Li was party chief in Liaoning, he was an enthusiastic supporter of Mr Xi\u2019s call for stricter enforcement of party discipline.\nAlso on the CCDI list was a Mr Wang Yang. While the name appears to be the same as retiring PSC member Wang Yang, the man is in fact secretary of Qinghai province\u2019s anti-corruption body.\nThe powerful CCDI, ostensibly in charge of party discipline, also serves as China\u2019s anti-graft body. Since President Xi came to power a decade ago, he has made fighting corruption a hallmark of his term, cleaning up what he felt was a culture of privilege among officials.\nBut critics said the campaign was also used to take down powerful rivals, including former Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai, who was jailed for life in 2013 for corruption, embezzlement and abuse of power.\nMembers of the CCDI, along with the CPC Central Committee, were picked by party cadres in elections on Saturday.\nMembers of the PSC will be unveiled on Sunday after the first plenary meeting of the new Central Committee, where President Xi is all but certain to receive a third term as general secretary, making him head of the party and, by extension, of the government.\nThe Central Committee comprises 205 full members and 171 alternate members. The full members will elect the 25-member Politburo, the PSC, the general secretary, the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission and chief of the CCDI.\nThe elections come at the end of a week-long party congress which saw about 2,300 party cadres from all over China gather at the Great Hall of The People in Beijing.\nHeld mostly behind closed doors, the meetings were meant to elect the party\u2019s next slate of leaders, as well as to set the agenda for the next five years."}
