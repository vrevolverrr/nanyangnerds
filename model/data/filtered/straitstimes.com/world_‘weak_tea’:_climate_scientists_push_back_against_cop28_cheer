The lack of an agreement to phase out fossil fuels was devastating.\u201d\nProf Mann called for a substantial reform of the COP rules, for example permitting super-majorities to approve decisions over the objections of holdout petrostates like Saudi Arabia, and barring oil executives such as COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber from presiding over future summits.\n\u201cMend it, don\u2019t end it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still need to continue with the COPs. They are our only multilateral framework for negotiating global climate policies.\n\u201cBut the failure of COP28 to achieve any meaningful progress at a time when our window of opportunity to limit warming below catastrophic levels is closing, is a source of great concern.\u201d\n\u2018Death knell for 1.5 deg C\u2019\nDr Kevin Anderson, a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said: \u201cNo doubt there will be lots of cheer and back-slapping... but the physics will not care.\u201d\nHumanity has between five and eight years of emissions at the current level before blowing through the \u201ccarbon budget\u201d required to hold long-term warming to the 1.5 deg C needed to avert the worst impacts of long term planetary heating, he said.\nEven if emissions begin to go down in 2024, which is not a requirement of the text, we would need to have zero fossil fuel use globally by 2040, rather than the \u201cfraudulent language of net zero by 2050\u201d envisaged in the deal, said Dr Anderson.\nHe described it as a \u201cdeath knell\u201d for 1.5 deg C, with even the less ambitious target of 2 deg C, which carries a significant risk for triggering dangerous tipping points in global climate systems, becoming more distant.\n\u2018Many will die\u2019\nDr Friederike Otto, a climatologist and leader in the field of assessing the role of climate change on specific extreme weather events, was also critical of the climate deal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hailed as a compromise, but we need to be very clear what has been compromised,\u201d said Dr Otto, who lectures at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change. \u201cThe short-term financial interest of a few have again won over the health, lives and livelihoods of most people living on this planet.\u201d\n\u201cWith every vague verb, every empty promise in the final text, millions more people will enter the frontline of climate change and many will die.\u201d\nBut Dr Johan Rockstrom, a professor in environmental science who directs the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, argued that while the COP would not hold the world to 1.5 deg C warming, it was still a \u201cpivotal landmark\u201d.\n\u201cThis agreement delivers on making it clear to all financial institutions, businesses and societies that we are now finally \u2013 eight years behind the Paris schedule \u2013 at the true \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d of the fossil-fuel driven world economy,\u201d he said.
