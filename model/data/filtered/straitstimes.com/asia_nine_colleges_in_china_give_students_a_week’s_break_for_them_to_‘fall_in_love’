This will not only broaden students\u2019 horizons and cultivate their sentiments, but also enrich and deepen the teaching content in the classroom.\u201d\nThe colleges \u2013 which are schools for students in the aviation industry \u2013 have been getting a week off in spring since 2019.\nHowever, this year\u2019s theme of \u201cenjoy the blossoms, go fall in love\u201d placed a special emphasis on romance.\nMs Liu Ping, deputy dean of Sichuan South-west Aviation Vocational College, said her school implemented the programme as students have been asking for time to make new friends and \u201cexperience the beauty of love\u201d.\nIt will not be all love and romance for the students, however.\nThey are still assigned homework, albeit unconventional assignments such as writing travel diaries, making handicrafts, filming travel videos and writing up reports of their personal growth.\nThis comes as China\u2019s birth rate in 2022 hit an all-time low of 6.77 births for every 1,000 people, down from 7.52 in 2021, despite a landmark decision to allow couples to have up to three children and a slew of measures to help with raising them.\nChina has been trying to raise its flagging fertility rate to stave off a growing reliance on the government to support its elderly population, but it has achieved little success so far.\nChanging attitudes towards raising children, a fall in the number of women at optimal child-bearing age and the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to China\u2019s dwindling birth rate."}
