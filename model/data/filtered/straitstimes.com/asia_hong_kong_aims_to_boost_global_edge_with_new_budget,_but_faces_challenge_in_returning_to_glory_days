That will be our main task. In this respect, we are making progress,\u201d he said.\nIn recent years, critics have argued that Hong Kong has lost its shine. The city has been struggling to reverse an outflow of businesses and residents following massive and often violent protests in 2019, a subsequent roll-out of a national security law by Beijing in 2020 that bans subversion, among other things, and tough Covid-19 restrictions.\nHong Kong\u2019s economy has also been affected by the struggling Chinese economy.\nIts tourism sector, for instance, which relies on mainland China for about 80 per cent of its visitors, has been slow to recover as there have been fewer Chinese visitors.\nDespite the fresh effort, some analysts say Hong Kong faces an uphill task in returning to its pre-pandemic glory days.\nMr Gary Ng, senior economist at investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, told The Straits Times that the announced Budget measures are far from enough to help the territory mitigate structural problems such as a labour shortage and a greying population.\n\u201cThe only spotlight in the Budget with a clear policy direction is on the real estate sector,\u201d said Mr Ng, who covers Greater China\u2019s macro economy.\nHe added that the lifting of all measures, including stamp duty applied to home owners who wish to sell their homes within two years, shows that the authorities are \u201cdesperate to stabilise the home market\u201d, given the pressure of falling land sales, which form around 20 per cent of total revenue for the government.\nThe immediate axing of all property cooling measures is aimed at boosting the city\u2019s sluggish real estate market by making it easier for home seekers to achieve their home ownership goals.\nHong Kong\u2019s home prices, once the most expensive in the world, have plunged almost 20 per cent since their peak in 2021.\nMr Joseph Tsang, chairman of property consultancy JLL in Hong Kong, said he welcomes the move to withdraw all cooling measures and expects the downward trend in property prices to slow down, bringing stability to the market.\nBut given that other headwinds such as high interest rates and weak economic sentiment remain, he said that the withdrawal of the measures alone is not enough to reverse the downward trend. As a result, he expects home prices to continue to fall by around 10 per cent in 2024.\n\u201cIt will require interest rate cuts and an economic improvement for prices to bottom out and rebound,\u201d he added.\nThe China factor\nNatixis\u2019 Mr Ng pointed out that the government \u201cmay be barking up the wrong tree\u201d in focusing on minor matters, such as monthly fireworks and drone shows, in a bid to entice tourists.\nRather, Hong Kong should be focusing more on ways to generate jobs and wealth such as keeping it easy for companies to do business and make money in the city, he said.\nMr Ng also noted that Hong Kong has been focusing on attracting foreign talent rather than retaining local talent, which does not ease the emigration trend. This is unlike Singapore, which, in its latest Budget on Feb 16, pumped in more education and upskilling support for its residents, he said.\nIn the latest Hong Kong Budget, the usually generous \u201csweeteners\u201d were slashed, with consumption vouchers and electricity bill subsidies scrapped and the cap on income tax deductions halved, to the disappointment of some residents.\nWhen asked about the lack of \u201csweeteners\u201d at a press conference after his Budget speech, Mr Chan said: \u201cWe believe it is better to improve the economy, which in turn can make people happier and have more money to spend, than help residents increase their income through government support measures.\n\u201cThus, we will put more resources into pushing economic development.\u201d\nProfessor Donald Low of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology noted that it was mostly a \u201cbelt-tightening Budget\u201d aimed at shoring up revenues and reducing expenditures incurred during the pandemic, with little for its lower and middle-income residents.\nIn the 2023-24 fiscal year, Hong Kong is expected to record a HK$101.6 billion (S$17.5 billion) deficit, almost double the forecast given by the government in 2023. Its reserves are expected to dip to HK$733.2 billion by the end of March.\nHowever, the Hong Kong financial chief said the city will return to a budget surplus in two years with the help of bond issuances, even as it plans to dip further into its reserves.\nOverall, the economy is expected to grow at a steady pace of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent in the medium term.\n\u201cThe message to the world is that despite the slow growth in recent years, the Hong Kong government is still a prudent and disciplined steward of public monies, that it won\u2019t splurge or spend indiscriminately, and that it is still a low-tax place for foreign investors and talent,\u201d said Prof Low.\nThat being said, analysts point out that the latest Budget measures can only go so far in bringing back Hong Kong\u2019s appeal, given China\u2019s tightening grip on the city.\nAssociate Professor Alfred Wu, from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said: \u201cIn the short term, people may be happy when Hong Kong offers them an incentive to invest. But in the long term, there\u2019s the China factor to consider, which may not appeal to some.\n\u201cIt will take time for Hong Kong to attract more foreign investments and return to their glory days,\u201d he added."}
