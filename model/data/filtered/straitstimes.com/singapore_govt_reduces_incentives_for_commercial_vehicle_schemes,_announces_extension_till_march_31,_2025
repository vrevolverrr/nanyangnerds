The threshold for carbon monoxide will remain unchanged.\nNEA and LTA said the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS), which incentivises owners of older, more pollutive diesel commercial vehicles and buses to replace them, will also be extended till March 31, 2025. The discount to replace an older vehicle will be reduced in most instances under the updated ETS.\nThe ETS for light commercial vehicles will cease after March 31, 2025, and both agencies said the Government will be studying other means, including regulatory levers, to encourage the early turnover of older commercial vehicles and buses in the future.\n\u201cThe adjustments to the CVES pollutant thresholds will continue to ensure a balanced variety of vehicle models across bands, while the adjusted CVES and ETS incentives will also maintain momentum towards cleaner vehicles,\u201d said the authorities.\nNEA\u2019s changes coincide with the so-called Worldwide Harmonised Light-duty Vehicles Test Procedure, which measures vehicle pollutant levels under more realistic conditions, and will likely result in higher pollutant levels measured. It will kick in here for new commercial vehicles from April 1, 2023.\nMr Neo Nam Heng, chairman of diversified motor group Prime, said the concession made by the authorities was good news.\n\u201cWhile this might still slow down the sales of electric light commercial vehicles, maintaining the $20,000 gap between Band A and C will deter most people from switching back to diesel modes,\u201d Mr Neo said.\nEven so, Mr Neo said some buyers may still consider diesel in the future, due to its lower cost. He noted that two popular petrol models, the Nissan NV350 and Toyota Hiace, will go from an incentive of $10,000 now to a surcharge of $15,000 next year. \u201cBuyers of these vehicles will either go electric, or back to diesel.\u201d\nMr Ron Lim, head of sales at Nissan agent Tan Chong Motor, said the announcement by the LTA and NEA shows that \u201cthey\u2019re listening to the ground\u201d.\nLike Mr Neo, Mr Lim said maintaining the $20,000 gap between Band A and C vehicles \u201csends a clear message\u201d, and should \u201cdeter people from going back to diesel\u201d.\nOn the ETS ceasing after March 31, 2025, Mr Neo said this may cause an issue because \u201cthere are not enough COEs (certificates of entitlement) for commercial vehicles\u201d.\n\u201cFor any country, the growth of the commercial vehicle population has to keep pace with economic growth,\u201d he added.\nSince 2018, the vehicle quota system has set a zero growth rate for all vehicles except for commercial vehicles, which are allowed to grow 0.25 per cent per year. Mr Neo said this is not enough.\nAs at end-October 2022, only 1 per cent of the 144,728 commercial vehicles here are electric, while 7.7 per cent are petrol. The vast majority are still diesel models."}
