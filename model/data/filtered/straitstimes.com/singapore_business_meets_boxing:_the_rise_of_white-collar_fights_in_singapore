{"title": "Business meets boxing: The rise of white-collar fights in Singapore", "tags": "singapore", "timestamp": "2024-09-20", "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Corporate executives in Singapore are trading their suits for boxing gloves as the sport catches on among white-collar professionals here.\nThese executives, who work in law, finance or the technology sector, are stepping into the ring to face off against each other, seeing the sport as a way to hone their competitive instincts while keeping fit at the same time.\nBoxing gyms here have capitalised on the sport\u2019s growing popularity, organising bouts for these \u201ccorporate boxers\u201d and billing these events as a way to both compete and network.\nMr Lim Xiuqi, an edutech business analyst with private education school Kaplan, is preparing for an upcoming fight on Oct 5 that has been called the \u201cClash in Lion City\u201d.\nThe 33-year-old, who looks unassuming dressed in a polo T-shirt, will take on automotive industry entrepreneur Andy Tan, 35.\nWin or lose, Mr Lim is looking forward to the bout, which will be his third fight so far.\n\u201cBoxing has completely changed my perspective. If you can take a punch in the ring, nothing at work feels as daunting,\u201d said Mr Lim, who picked up boxing after the Covid-19 pandemic. He now trains with national coach Muhamad Ridhwan at boxing gym Legends Fight Sport in Tampines.\nHis opponent, Mr Tan, took up boxing three years ago after being inspired by the iconic movie Rocky, in which actor Sylvester Stallone plays a small-time Philadelphia boxer who fights the world heavyweight champion.\n\u201cLife is like boxing \u2013 you get punched and you get back up. That\u2019s how you grow,\u201d said Mr Tan, who added that he loves the sport because it mirrors the challenges of real life.\nThe duo will be among the 14 white-collar executives and four professional boxers at the upcoming Oct 5 event, which is organised by Mr Ridhwan\u2019s Leyendas Promotions and Mr Hamzah Farouk of Brothers Boxing Promotions.\nEvents like these provide participants with a sense of competition and achievement, without the need to pursue boxing professionally, said Mr Hamzah.\nTo be held at Orchard Hotel, the event will have up to 40 dinner tables available for spectators \u2013 of which some 60 per cent have already been sold. Tables cost between $2,000 and $4,000.\n\u201cPeople in the corporate world are drawn to (boxing), especially with the increasing number of boxing gyms opening up,\u201d said Mr Hamzah. \u201cThey start as a way to stay fit but over time, they want to take it to the next level by entering competitions.\u201d\nSuch boxing events here seem to be on the rise, and those in the industry said it has benefited gyms and trainers.\n\u201cWhen people sign up for fights, they train at gyms, engage coaches and bring in more business,\u201d said Mr Hamzah. \u201cThis trickles down to the grassroots, helping to build a stronger boxing community in Singapore.\u201d\nThe Singapore Boxing Federation (SBF) sanctioned two white-collar boxing events in 2023 and four in 2024.\nAnother upcoming fight, to be held on Oct 18 and organised by Spartans Boxing Club at Orchid Country Club, will feature 18 participants, including lawyers, bankers and teachers, said Mr Christopher Chua, a franchisee of the gym.\nMr Chua said membership at his Cecil Street outlet has nearly doubled in just over a year.\nSBF president Fairuz Mohamed said the federation also benefits from these events, using them to attract sponsors for its national athletes. He pointed out that the number of boxing gyms and clubs affiliated with SBF has gone from fewer than 10 before 2015, to 26 today. There are also more than 40 gyms offering boxing, he said.\n\u201cWhile corporate boxing may be a spectacle, we ensure that (these events) stay true to the essence of boxing, with proper match-making and safety measures in place.\u201d\nClarification note: In an earlier version of the story, we said there are more than 40 gyms offering boxing that are not affiliated with SBF. Mr Fairuz Mohamed has since clarified that the gyms are also affiliated with SBF."}
