This is the critical challenge of our time.\u201d\nDPM Heng said the world needs to come together to face global challenges such as climate change, disruptions caused by technological advancements, and health security issues such as another pandemic.\nSuch global cooperation is unlikely if geopolitical tensions and protectionism are on the rise, he said, referring to the intensifying US-China trade war.\nHe referred to Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s address to a joint session of the United States Congress in 1985, in which Singapore\u2019s founding father and first prime minister made a powerful case for free trade and investment.\nIn those days, the world had just emerged from a recession and high inflation, and many US legislators were calling for protectionist measures to address trade imbalances, job losses and budget deficits.\nMr Lee, addressing the Congress, said: \u201cDoes America wish to abandon the contest between democracy and the free market on the one hand, versus communism and the controlled economy on the other, when she has nearly won this contest for the hearts and minds of the Third World?\u201d\nHe went on to urge the US to continue to maintain its position as the \u201canchor economy of the free market economies of the world\u201d, in an open, peaceful and rules-based international order.\nDPM Heng said that, in some ways, the US today faces the same choice. The fate of the global trading system is critical for Singapore, given the economy\u2019s dependence on trade.\nThe AmChamSG event at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel also marked the 20th anniversary of the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Bilateral trade between the two nations since 2004 has almost tripled, hitting a peak of US$207 billion (S$271 billion) in 2021.\nUS investment in Singapore stood at US$309.4 billion in 2022. American businesses in Singapore employed about 191,400 workers here in 2021.\nDPM Heng said Singapore looks forward to upgrading the free-trade pact with a deal on the digital economy.\n\u201cWe cannot be looking back; we should be looking forward and looking forward. I think (the) digital economy will be important.\u201d\nSingapore has concluded five digital trade agreements, including one with the European Union in July.\nIn 2023, the US-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue was launched. The initiative was followed in 2024 with the Roadmap for Digital Economic Cooperation, identifying priority areas of mutual interest such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and cyber security.\nDPM Heng said scientific and technological advances in generative AI and mRNA vaccines have reshaped entire industries, and our lives, in recent years.\nHe said: \u201cThe nature of these breakthrough technologies is such that it is very easy to overestimate their value in the short term and underestimate their value in the long term.\u201d\nHence, Singapore has decided to harness such innovation and keep its economy and workers competitive.\nHe said given that US businesses are among the most innovative in the world, he expects them to play their role to help unlock new innovations and transformation in Singapore and across the Asean region.\nAmChamSG chief executive Lei Hsien-Hsien said US businesses would like to work more closely with the Singapore authorities to help impart training to the workforce in Singapore and across the region."}
