The highest offer is currently $1,300.\nWhen asked their reasons for selling the medal, a user, who listed his medal for $380, said that he is selling it as he is in urgent need of money.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to sell and donate the money to charity,\u201d said another user, who listed his medal for $1,500.\nWhen contacted, a Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) spokesperson said: \u201cThe Covid-19 Resilience Medals are national awards that honour individuals and teams from the public, private and people sectors who have contributed to Singapore\u2019s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cThe medals should be handled with respect, in accordance with the spirit with which they were presented.\u201d\nThe Covid-19 Resilience Medal and the Covid-19 Resilience Certificate were awarded to more than 100,000 individuals and teams in 2023.\nThe medal was awarded to an individual who had contributed to Singapore\u2019s fight against the pandemic, while the certificate was awarded to a group for its collective contribution.\nThe awards were announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech in August 2022.\nA post put up by the Instagram account @thehonesthealthcareworker, which is run by several healthcare workers anonymously, said the group is disappointed to see other front-liners selling their medals.\nIn the post on Dec 13, the group wrote: \u201cThat award is a symbol of the collective will and sacrifice of those who put their country before their own comfort.\n\u201cIt was earned, not bought. To put (the medal) up for sale dishonours and diminishes the significance of all that they did. Some things are simply not and cannot be for sale.\u201d\nElaborating on the sacrifices made by healthcare workers, the group said these workers had to wear personal protective equipment for eight hours a day, endured breathing difficulties when wearing N95 masks and had to move out of their homes during the pandemic so that their families would not be at risk of getting infected.\nThe medal is a silver disc encircled by eight arrows pointing towards its centre. Its front side bears a crescent and five stars, with the words \u201cCovid-19\u201d and \u201cResilience Medal\u201d, while its reverse side holds the state crest encircled by the words \u201cSG United\u201d and \u201cStronger Together\u201d.\nAll medals awarded for Covid-19 contributions have a ribbon that has a thin red line at its centre, flanked on each side by a strip of white, light turquoise and dark turquoise.\nChecks by ST also found national medals such as the Pingat Bakti Setia, also known as the Long Service Medal, listed on Carousell for $150 to $400. The award is given to those who have completed 25 years of service in sectors such as the government and education."}
