He had imposed travel restrictions on Mr Najib last Saturday after it emerged that he was about to fly off to Jakarta for a short break.\nIn the 25-minute interview with WSJ's Asia enterprise editor Patrick Barta, Dr Mahathir was also asked about the transition of power to jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim - who is due to get a royal pardon and be released on Wednesday - and Chinese investments in Malaysia.\nDr Mahathir, who first led the country from 1981 to 2003 as head of its largest party Umno, is now prime minister under an agreement with the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition that he would eventually hand over power to Datuk Seri Anwar, whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat has the most MPs in the four-party alliance.\n\"In the initial stages, maybe lasting one or two years, I will have to be the PM and I will have to run the country,\" he said. \"The reason why the public supported us is that they had faith in the leadership of the opposition to resolve problems, and this largely depends on the experience of the people leading the opposition. That includes me, of course.\"\nDr Mahathir, who turns 93 in July, added: \"By the time I'm 95, I should be ready to step down, but I will play a role in the background even after I step down.\"\nMr Anwar's release will pave the way for the former deputy prime minister - who was sacked by Dr Mahathir in 1998 and is serving a jail term for sodomy, which he maintains is politically motivated - to run in a by-election and be an MP.\n\"Maybe he will have a seat in the Cabinet, which we haven't decided yet,\" Dr Mahathir said.\nAs for disagreements within PH over the Cabinet, Dr Mahathir said there were four parties in PH and he had to try and satisfy everyone. \"Now it is accepted that the final decision will be made by me,\" he said.\nAs for Mr Anwar, as the leader of one of the coalition parties, \"we expect he will have the same powers as the leaders of the other (three)\".\nDr Mahathir also repeated his concerns over Chinese projects in Malaysia. China has been Malaysia's top source of foreign direct investment (FDI) and commerce, but he said on the campaign trail that its projects brought little benefit to Malaysians.\nOn Tuesday, Dr Mahathir said: \"China is a friend of Malaysia, but when it comes to FDI, there is a difference in terms of definition.\"\n\"FDI means bringing in capital and technology, setting up plants in Malaysia, employing Malaysians up to the level of executives and that the product will be for the Malaysian market or for export,\" he said.\n\"But we do not consider coming into Malaysia, buying up huge chunks of land and developing counties and even cities and bringing in foreigners to live in this country as FDI.\"\nHe noted that some of these projects involve luxury apartments that cater largely to foreigners and are out of the reach of the average Malaysian.\nAs a result, Dr Mahathir said that Malaysia will look at restricting immigrants \"and accept only a certain number that we can deal with and perhaps absorb\"."}
