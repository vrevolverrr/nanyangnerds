The project has a message for Russia: Russia cannot count on winning if it bets on a long war.\u201d\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said his country would work with the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark \u201cto get Ukraine the combat air capability it needs\u201d.\nTraining on the US-made jets will take place in Europe and take time, US officials have said, estimating that at least 18 months are needed for training and delivery.\nA French military official briefing reporters at the G-7 was cautious about the process, saying that in the case of France, the offer was for basic pilot training.\nDiscussions with Kyiv were ongoing and no Ukrainian pilots were now being trained in France, the official said.\nFrance does not have F-16s, only French-made Rafale warplanes and previous-generation Mirage 2000 jets.\nThe official said training a person from scratch to operate a Nato-made warplane could take as long as four years, while an experienced pilot used to Ukrainian jets would need four to nine months.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the immediate priority for Ukraine. We are in a counteroffensive stage and this training won\u2019t be ready in the coming weeks, but for the long term.\u201d\nThe official noted that talk of F-16s was grabbing headlines, as the issue of German-made Leopard tanks had done before, but insisted that the current request was just for training. \u201cIt\u2019s the logo to show the initiative. It\u2019s an initiative to train pilots without putting a plane behind it,\u201d he said. REUTERS"}
