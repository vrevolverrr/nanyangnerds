Nuclear power also ensures a stable and continuous energy supply, unlike renewable sources such as solar and wind, which depend on weather conditions. This reliability is essential for maintaining energy security and supporting Singapore\u2019s economic growth.\nAdvancements in nuclear technology have led to the development of safer and more efficient reactors. Modern designs include numerous safety features and comply with stringent international standards, significantly reducing the risk of accidents. Small modular reactors can offer a flexible and safer alternative suitable for Singapore\u2019s urban environment.\nUnlike fossil fuels, nuclear power plants do not emit greenhouse gases during operation, making them useful in the fight against climate change. Given Singapore\u2019s limited land area, the high energy density of nuclear power allows substantial electricity to be produced without the need for vast amounts of space.\nWhile the initial costs of building nuclear infrastructure are high, the long-term benefits are considerable. Diversifying our energy mix to include nuclear power reduces the reliance on imported fossil fuels and enhances our energy resilience.\nDomestically, Singapore could expect some form of resistance against having a nuclear power plant in Singapore, namely from environmental groups and those who are turned off by the mere mention of \u201cnuclear\u201d.\nHaving a nuclear reactor within our shores may also invite some form of resistance from neighbouring countries. Despite these barriers, dialogue and engagement with Singaporeans must take place now so the country can embrace this change and support the integration of nuclear energy into the national strategy."}
