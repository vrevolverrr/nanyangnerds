The Parking Day event was introduced here in 2013.\nMr Tay, who usually operates out of his shop at Everton Park, told The Straits Times that he took the opportunity to educate visitors on the finer points of TCM during the Queenstown event, which was run by the community group Queenstown Kakis and was held at a carpark in Stirling Road.\nHe dished out tips on how to massage one\u2019s acupoints and meridians to relieve symptoms of back and shoulder pain or insomnia. According to TCM principles, acupoints and meridians are crucial healing points that correspond to various vital organs in the body.\nThe 2024 Parking Day event across Singapore \u2013 organised by Bold At Work, a platform that prepares young people for the future of work \u2013 took place at carparks in Chai Chee, Lengkok Bahru, Queenstown, Yishun and Jurong East. About 1,000 people attended the event, the organisers said.\nIt is part of Bold At Work\u2019s Design The Good Life initiative, which comes under the nationwide Movements For Health programme, a social movement led by the Ministry of Health\u2019s Office for Healthcare Transformation.\nOver at Chai Chee, 14 carpark spots were transformed into activity spaces that included an interactive self-care installation booth and a de-stress zone where families created terrariums \u2013 sealable glass containers containing soil and plants that can be opened for maintenance to access the plants inside.\nThe Chai Chee event was organised by Filos Community Services, a not-for-profit social service organisation.\nMany of the booths at the space in Chai Chee Avenue were created by students from Temasek Secondary School.\nThese included SolaceSphere, an online safe space for users to discuss their mental health struggles, which uses artificial intelligence tools such as chatbots to provide emotional support and solutions.\nAnother project by the students was Lights, Camera, Action!, a scenario-based role-playing game that helps family members foster empathy by placing family members in one another\u2019s shoes, according to team member and student Aliza Mohammad Noh, 14.\nFilos Community Services also launched a new children\u2019s book - Can We Play Together? - written by Singapore author Emily Lim, at the event. It is the first in a four-part series of health-themed books for early readers, focusing on themes of play, eat, exercise and rest.\nMr Tan Kiat How, Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information, and National Development, who was one of two guests of honour at the Chai Chee event, said that it was a good way to bring awareness about mental health into the community, and he was impressed by the way the students stepped up to bring their ideas to fruition for the event.\n\u201cI have been working very closely with partners like Filos on the ground for a number of years, and I am very happy to see the partnership working on a very important topic,\u201d the East Coast GRC MP told ST. The other guest of honour in Chai Chee was Dr Choo Pei Ling, second adviser to the Marine Parade GRC grassroots organisations (Kembangan-Chai Chee).\nAmong the participants at Chai Chee was Ms Sudha Subramaniam, 36, who was there with her two children, Danyassi and Navilan.\nThe Chai Chee resident told ST that her children were drawn to the booth for creating terrariums, while she was keen on booths by Filos containing information on how to create healthy meals for her family.\nThe event was a fun day out for her children, who were also interested in the role-playing card games organised by the students.\n\u201cIt was a really fulfilling day for the children, and they really enjoyed it,\u201d she said."}
