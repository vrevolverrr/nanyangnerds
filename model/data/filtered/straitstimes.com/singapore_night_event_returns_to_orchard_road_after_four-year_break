They will host a range of activities, from art workshops to capsule toy vending machines and accessory customisation, among others.\nIn a statement on March 21, the Orchard Road Business Association said the monthly event will be held 10 times in 2024. It will take place from 3pm to 10pm on the last week of every month.\nEach month will have a different theme, such as wellness or pets, it added.\nPlans are under way to bring in regional brands to the event. Those attending the event in March will be able to purchase clothes from Loma.Whale, which sells its goods at the Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok.\nFuture events will feature brands from Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea, the statement said.\nThe launch of Night at Orchard in 2019 was well received, and many vendors were disappointed when it could not continue in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and related measures to restrict its spread, said Mr Mark Shaw, chairman of the Orchard Road Business Association.\n\u201cIn recent years, Singapore has seen a flourishing number of young entrepreneurs, not just in the tech sector but also in the food and beverage, lifestyle and entertainment sectors,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe return of Night at Orchard underscores the business association\u2019s commitment to supporting Singapore\u2019s fledgling brands by offering valuable exposure to both residents and tourists along Singapore\u2019s most iconic shopping street.\u201d"}
