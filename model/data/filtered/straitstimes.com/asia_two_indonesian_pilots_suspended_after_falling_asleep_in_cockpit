He then saw that his second-in-command or SIC was sleeping and woke him up, the NTSC wrote in the preliminary investigation report of what it described as a \u201cserious incident\u201d.\nIn the previous leg from Jakarta to Kendari, the pilot suggested that the second officer \u201ctake a rest\u201d as he was aware that the SIC did not get a proper rest. \u201cThe SIC rested in the cockpit and slept for about 30 minutes,\u201d the report said.\nBatik Air said in the statement on March 9 that it operates with an adequate rest policy for its crew, in accordance with regulations, to ensure they are in optimal physical and mental condition when carrying out their duties.\nLion Air\u2019s safety record has been in the spotlight over the years. The privately held carrier has suffered several hull losses \u2013 the industry term for aircraft damaged beyond repair.\nIn 2018, one of the carrier\u2019s Boeing-737 Max 8 planes crashed shortly after take-off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people aboard. It was later revealed that there was a design flaw in the aircraft after a second crash in Ethiopia, resulting in the global grounding of the aircraft type for years.\nIn 2013, a two-month-old Lion Air Boeing 737-800 landed in the water, short of a runway at Ngurah Rai Bali International Airport. The aircraft fuselage broke apart on impact, but there were no fatalities. BLOOMBERG"}
