Therefore, returning to the same point from which Obama left is almost impossible\", Mr Rashed said.\nUnder Mr Trump, Washington withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and assassinated its once-untouchable military supremo Qasem Soleimani.\nThe President and his family instead cultivated close relations with the Gulf monarchies.\nSaudi Arabia's pro-government Okaz asked whether the Biden administration would stand by Washington's Arab allies or \"renew with their enemies\".\nIn Bahrain, the paper Akhbar Al-Khaleej aid Mr Trump deserved \"thanks and appreciation\".\nHis \"policies and positions against Iran have established a new reality in American dealings with Iran, and it will be difficult for the Biden administration to completely bypass them\", its columnist Al-Sayed Zahra wrote.\nJust across the Gulf from Iran, Bahrain is a longstanding Western ally and home to the US Fifth Fleet.\nIn 2011, with support from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain's ruling family crushed month-long protests calling for an elected prime minister."}
