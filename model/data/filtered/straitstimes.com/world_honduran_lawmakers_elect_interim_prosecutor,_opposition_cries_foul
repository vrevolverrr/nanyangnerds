The declaration will remain in place until at least Nov. 17.\nOn at least four previous occasions, Libre lawmakers came up short with the votes needed to elect Zelaya.\nThe committee vote to elect him also took place at a time when the Congress is in recess.\nLuis Redondo, the president of the Congress, defended Zelaya's election since Chinchilla's term formally ended in August. But his deputy, Daniel Sibrian, moved into the role immediately afterwards.\nOpposition leaders criticized the interim election as an underhanded move to circumvent the rules.\n\"It's illegal,\" said Tomas Zambrano, leader of the conservative National Party opposition bloc.\n\"They're taking us to a dictatorship in Honduras, like the ones in Venezuela and Nicaragua,\" added Zambrano.
