The transfers will come into effect from August.\nMr Karun\u2019s transfer comes after Airports of Thailand (AOT) conducted an investigation into the travellator incident in June.\nOn June 29, a female passenger got her leg stuck in the moving walkway at the airport\u2019s domestic terminal. Her left leg was eventually amputated.\nThe source said the investigation found that the incident was caused by one of the travellator\u2019s plates slipping off its frame due to missing screws. Investigators reportedly found three loose screws in the pit beneath the travellator.\nThe travellator was originally installed in 1987 and underwent a complete part upgrade in 2015 by the original manufacturer.\nIt has five safety sensors but lacks one at the floor plates because it is an old model, said the source.\nAOT director Kirati Kitmanawat reportedly said the authorities have proposed the hiring of a third-party investigator to check the condition and safety of all walkways and related equipment at Don Mueang airport to restore passengers\u2019 confidence.\nThe investigators must be experts in escalators, elevators and travellators.\nThe airport will also install additional CCTV cameras at all walkways to monitor if there is any damage or missing parts, he added.\nFinally, the airport will hire an external audit company to audit the maintenance of all mechanical equipment in the airport."}
