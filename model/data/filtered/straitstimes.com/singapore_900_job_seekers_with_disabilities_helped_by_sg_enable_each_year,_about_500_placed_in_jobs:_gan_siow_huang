She noted that Workforce Singapore and NTUC\u2019s e2i do not track whether job seekers assisted have disabilities.\nUnder disability agency SG Enable\u2019s Open Door Programme, SG Enable works with job placement and job support partners such as Autism Resource Centre, Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore and SPD, she said. Under the scheme, people with disabilities can receive up to one year of job matching and employment support from trained job coaches.\nThese partners provide coaches trained to help persons with disabilities with their job search and provide on-site support to help these job seekers adjust to their new roles, said Ms Gan. The job coaches also advise employers on adapting job tasks and the work environment to better suit the needs of employees with disabilities.\nMr David also asked if a more permanent or dedicated department can be set up to cater to the job needs of people with disabilities, which relies on Singapore\u2019s tripartite model of working with unions, employers and the Government.\nMs Gan said: \u201cIndeed, we\u2019ll be very willing to work together to support employment, and upskilling of persons with disabilities.\u201d\nShe also cited the first Enabling Business Hub, which opened in December and provides customised job support to people with various disabilities to help them sustain employment, and equips employers with inclusive practices to hire and integrate persons with disabilities.\nSet up by SG Enable, the hub rents out office space to inclusive employers such as Bizlink Centre and Superduper, and has a realistic e-commerce and logistics fulfilment environment set up to prepare persons with disabilities to work in the logistics sector.\n\u201cNow, this is a new structure. It is a new institution if you like, a one-stop shop for employers, social support agencies, persons with disabilities, tripartite partners, and the whole of society to come together to support persons with disabilities in finding jobs, and also to help them (stay) employed,\u201d she said. Ms Gan also noted Singapore\u2019s aspirational goal of having 40 per cent of persons with disabilities employed by 2030.\n\u201cWe encourage employers to approach SG Enable, and to tap the Open Door Programme as well as other employment support services to hire, train and integrate persons with disabilities into their organisations.\u201d"}
