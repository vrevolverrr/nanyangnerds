The guidelines will build on these, MOM noted.\nThe guidelines, which will be compulsory for employers to follow, were mooted for the first time in the White Paper on Singapore Women\u2019s Development submitted to Parliament in March 2022.\nThe ministry said that FWAs help employees achieve better work-life harmony and promote a more engaged and productive workforce, which, in turn, benefits employers.\nIt also said employers who offer flexi-work also benefit from better talent attraction and retention.\n\u201cAs Singapore is fast becoming a \u2018super-aged\u2019 society with growing caregiver needs and tight labour supply, FWAs have also become increasingly important to enable more employees to continue working or re-enter the workforce while managing their caregiving commitments,\u201d MOM said.\nThe guidelines seek to build mutual understanding and trust between employers and employees as they discuss suitable arrangements that support both business and employee needs, it added.\n\u201cThe tripartite partners also recognise that it is important to take a calibrated and enabling approach so that FWAs are implemented effectively and used responsibly,\u201d said the ministry.\nThe 11-member workgroup is jointly chaired by Ms Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State for Manpower and Education; Ms Yeo Wan Ling, director of NTUC\u2019s women and family unit and its small-and-medium enterprise unit; and Mr Edwin Ng, SNEF\u2019s honorary secretary.\nA smaller group within the main workgroup will develop a resource package \u2013 such as templates, best practices and training \u2013 to help employees and employers.\nCo-chairing this sub-group are Ms Faith Li, general manager of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, and Mr Aslam Sardar, chief executive of the Institute for Human Resource Professionals.\nMs Yeo said NTUC has gathered strong feedback about the increasing load and anxieties that workers are facing from balancing caregiving responsibilities and work aspirations.\nThe guidelines will address this by making it acceptable and easier for workers to request FWAs, she said.\n\u201cSuch progress highlights the important role employers play in helping employees thrive in the workplace and at home,\u201d she said, noting that the labour movement also invited union leaders to join the workgroup to ensure workers\u2019 concerns are adequately represented.\nMr Ng said employees need to appreciate that their employers have to ensure that business needs are met so that the company will continue to do well, even as more employers have implemented FWAs to meet employee needs."}
