Citi also cut its 2025 forecast by 3 percentage points to 18 per cent.\nThe EU plans to phase out new sales of fuel-burning cars by 2035, with some caveats for synthetic fuels. In 2026, policymakers will assess the pace of transition and its feasibility for consumers.\nCharging infrastructure gaps and high vehicle prices remain key hurdles for the ambitious climate-friendly policy that is remaking the business case for the region\u2019s storied auto leaders such as Renault, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\n\u201cThe EV transition was always going to be cyclical and not a straight line,\u201d Mr Blume told journalists on March 13, adding that he wants the EU to stick with ending combustion engine car sales by 2035.\n\u201cWe need planning certainty \u2013 it\u2019s not helpful to have discussions to change course just when there\u2019s a bit of headwind.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
