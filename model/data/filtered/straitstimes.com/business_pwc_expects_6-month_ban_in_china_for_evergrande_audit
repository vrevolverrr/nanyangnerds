PwC declined to comment on Aug 22.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian, a Shanghai-registered firm that is part of PwC\u2019s global network, was Hengda\u2019s auditor during the period in question.\nPwC was Evergrande\u2019s auditor for more than a decade until the global accounting firm resigned in January 2023, due to what the developer said were audit-related disagreements.\nAmong the Big Four accounting firms, PwC was one of the most commonly used by Chinese real estate firms listed in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nMore than 30 publicly listed firms based in mainland China, including state-owned giants Bank of China and PetroChina, have dropped PwC as their auditor in 2024. Most of the changes happened after the firm came under scrutiny for its role in an alleged accounting fraud at property developer China Evergrande.\nPwC still counts some of China\u2019s biggest internet companies, including Tencent Holdings, Alibaba Group Holding, Meituan and Xiaomi, as clients.\nPwC told clients its staff will keep working during the suspension and will be able to certify the audits on 2024 annual reports once the ban is lifted in March 2025, the Financial Times reported earlier.
