Mrs Williams was first.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just as happy as can be to be up in space,\u201d she said, during a brief welcoming ceremony a short time later.\nThey were greeted warmly with hugs and handshakes by the outpost\u2019s current seven resident crew members: four fellow US astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts.\nPlans call for Mr Wilmore and Mrs Williams to remain aboard the station for about eight days, then depart on a return flight that will take Starliner on a fiery reentry back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere and end with a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US Desert Southwest, a first for a crewed Nasa mission.\nJune 6 was a busy day for the US space programme, as SpaceX\u2019s next-generation Starship rocket survived a fiery, hypersonic return from space and achieved a breakthrough landing demonstration in the Indian Ocean in its fourth test flight.\nOn Starliner\u2019s voyage to the ISS, helium leaks were detected in its propulsion system, knocking out some of the 28 thrusters used by the capsule to make precision maneuvers in space. However, the spacecraft still had enough functioning thrusters to compensate for the loss, according to Nasa and Boeing. An additional thruster was disabled by mission control just before final approach.\nBoeing built Starliner under contract with Nasa to compete with SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency\u2019s only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. The current mission marks Starliner\u2019s first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before Nasa can certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\nSelected as crew for the pivotal flight were two Nasa veterans who have previously logged 500 days in space between them: Mr Wilmore, 61, a retired Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Mrs Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its US$4.2 billion (S$5.7 billion), fixed-priced contract with Nasa, which wants the redundancy of two different US rides to the ISS.\nThe Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than US$1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane manufacturing operations have been rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 Max jetliners. REUTERS"}
