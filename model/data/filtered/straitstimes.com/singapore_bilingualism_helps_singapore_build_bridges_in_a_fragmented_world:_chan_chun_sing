Neither monolingualism nor multilingualism without a common language will serve us well. But we believe our bilingualism path is well worth the effort.\"\nIn a pre-recorded message, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that Singapore started out as a multiracial and multilingual nation, and English was chosen as the working language of commerce and administration.\nHe said: \"But we wanted to preserve the mother tongue languages to strengthen our cultural roots, which is core to our Singaporean identity.\"\nAt the event, Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Communications and Information and chair of the Bulan Bahasa committee, spoke at a round-table discussion about bilingualism and its future in Singapore.\nThe other panellists were Mr Arun Mahizhnan, special research adviser at the Institute of Policy Studies and director of the Centre for Singapore Tamil Culture, and Mr Kuek Yu-Chuang, vice-president of international business at Chinese streaming service iQiyi.\nMr Kuek spoke on the need to make the language come alive for the next generation so that mother tongue is seen not just as an exam subject, but also something they can have fun with.\nFor example, a mother tongue-related TikTok challenge could make it more engaging to the younger demographic, he said.\nMr Mahizhnan shared about how the deliberate use of mother tongue by his whole family ensured that they kept in touch with their culture and helped him to become bilingual.\nMs Rahayu suggested having a tiered approach for people who have different levels of ability and levels of appreciation for bilingualism.\n\"We need to have more curated and targeted efforts. So for those who like pop culture music, we should tailor some of those interesting bits for you,\" she said."}
