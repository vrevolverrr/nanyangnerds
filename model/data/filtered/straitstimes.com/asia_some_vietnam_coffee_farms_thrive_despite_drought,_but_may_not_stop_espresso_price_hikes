But it remains unclear whether the improved weather will help boost output and drive down prices of robusta beans, the variety most commonly found in espressos and instant coffees, of which Vietnam is the world\u2019s top producer.\n\u201cI expect the country\u2019s output to fall by 10 per cent to15 per cent, but my farm will increase production,\u201d said Mr Nguyen Huu Long, who grows coffee in a 50ha plantation in Gia Lai, one of the top coffee-producing provinces in Vietnam.\nTo protect his trees during the heatwave, he kept the soil around the plants moist by covering it with leaves. Contrary to the local practice of cutting trees after a few years to boost soil quality, he keeps his growing for decades. As a result, plants have deeper roots and broader access to underground water reserves.\nFarmers in his plantation also soften the soil around plants to improve absorption of rainwater and fertilisers, said coffee farmer Doan Van Thang, 39.\nMs Tran Thi Huong, a tenant farmer who works in another plantation 20km from Pleiku, Gia Lai\u2019s capital, resorted to using more water than usual. Thanks to abundant reserves from canals built by the local authorities, she could keep her plants sufficiently irrigated during the heatwave.\nCoffee cherries are smaller than in previous years, but she expects the overall output to be unaffected. It also helped that she timely intervened with biopesticides against bugs that were more numerous than usual because of the extreme weather.\nThat is in line with the forecast from the United States Department of Agriculture, which estimates Vietnam\u2019s next harvest would be roughly steady versus the current season\u2019s output \u2013 far less pessimistic than domestic projections.\nBitter price effect?\nWhatever the impact on the harvest will be, coffee prices for drinkers around the world are likely to rise.\nWholesale prices in Vietnam and London-traded robusta futures have risen to record highs earlier in 2024 mostly after an underwhelming harvest in Vietnam and because of fears over the country\u2019s next harvest after the drought, according to multiple traders and analysts.\nRecord wholesale prices have so far had a limited impact on consumer prices, with coffee inflation up by only 1.6 per cent in the 27-country European Union in April, according to the latest Eurostat data, and 2.5 per cent in robusta-loving Italy.\nWhile well below price rises from a year earlier, it was higher than 1 per cent in the March EU reading, a sign roasters may have started to pass their higher costs on consumers.\nBesides, worries about Vietnam are far from over, as insufficient rain after the drought or excessive downpours before the upcoming October harvest season could further reduce output, warned a Vietnam-based trader.\nThe high wholesale prices may also be there to stay, as robusta demand is growing globally and farmers have boosted their leverage in the current circumstances, with many having also replaced coffee plants with pungent-smelling durian, a tropical fruit experiencing huge demand in China.\n\u201cThey have the financial ability to hoard and hold on goods, so they will not be in a hurry to sell,\u201d said Mr Le Thanh Son of Simexco, one of Vietnam\u2019s biggest coffee exporters.
