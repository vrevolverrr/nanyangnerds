It is threatening democracy and human rights now.\u201d\nMr Guterres said a \u201cUnited Nations code of conduct for information integrity on digital platforms\u201d was being developed ahead of the UN\u2019s Summit of the Future slated for next year.\nHis policy brief, which will feed the code of conduct, includes a slew of proposals, including that advertisers implicated in monetising harmful content take full responsibility for their spending.\n\u201cDisinformation and hate should not generate maximum exposure and massive profits,\u201d Mr Guterres said.\nWhile unleashing social and cultural transformation globally, online platforms have also \u201cexposed a darker side\u201d, he warned.\n\u201cThe ability to disseminate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an existential risk to humanity,\u201d he insisted, referring to their risk to democratic institutions and human rights.\nHe said that the code of conduct should be based on a commitment to information integrity, human rights and support for independent media.\n\u201cWe must learn from the mistakes of the past. Digital platforms were launched into the world without sufficient awareness or assessment of the potential damage to societies and individuals,\u201d Mr Guterres said.\n\u201cThe era of Silicon Valley\u2019s \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 philosophy must be brought to a close.\u201d AFP"}
