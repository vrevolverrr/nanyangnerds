So far, he has ignored the candidate agreed on by the left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front, which came top in the vote.\nThe aim of the Aug 23 meetings with presidents of the party groups in the National Assembly and Senate is to \u201cbuild the broadest and most stable majority possible to serve the country\u201d, Mr Macron\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\u201cIn the legislative elections, the French people expressed their desire for change and a broad-based consensus. In a spirit of responsibility, all political leaders must work to implement this desire,\u201d the statement added, saying the appointment of a new prime minister will follow on from these talks.\nA source close to Mr Macron told Reuters in August that the president believes the vote delivered a National Assembly whose centre of gravity is in the centre or the centre-right and that a new prime minister should be able to find common ground with moderates across the political spectrum.
