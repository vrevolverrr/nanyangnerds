They need to go back to the old records and account for their ex-detainees, ex-members and the presence of Malaysian students studying in JI-affiliated schools in Indonesia,\u201d said the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies associate research fellow, referring to terror group ISIS.\nThe academic theorised that the police killings could have been carried out by a JI splinter group, seeing that the last JI terror strike took place on Sept 16, 2014, with the bombing of the Rizal Park Monument in the Philippines, which killed one person and injured seven others.\nFurthermore, he observed that JI had been \u201cpeaceful\u201d in the past decade, with its founder Abu Bakar Bashir voting for the first time in the recent Indonesian elections in February.\nHe said there could be a split between JI leaders who want to obtain power through the ballot box, and those who may want to maintain its radical stance.\n\u201cWith this incident, there could be a splinter faction, which is not new with JI. The Bali bombings were conducted by leaders advocating a violent jihad instead of a peaceful jihad, such as Hambali and Malaysian bomb-maker Noordin Mohammad Top,\u201d said Mr Singh.\nThe terror organisation\u2019s most notorious attack was the series of bombings in Bali on Oct 12, 2002, which killed 202 people and injured 209 more.\nOther attacks include the 2003 JW Marriot bombing in Jakarta, the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta, the 2005 Bali bombings and the 2009 Jakarta bombings.\nA notable JI member was Singaporean Mas Selamat Kastari, who escaped from detention in Singapore in February 2008 and was recaptured in Skudai, Johor, in April 2009. He is currently detained in Singapore under the Internal Security Act.\nEven though the group was officially founded in Malaysia in 1993 by Indonesians Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir, Mr Singh said this incident is apparently the first attack in Malaysia as JI prefers to operate in Indonesia and the Philippines.\nMr Andrin Raj, who is a director with the Nordic Counter Terrorism Network told ST that JI has always been a serious concern in the region, and its threat has never been fully neutralised.\nHe observed that JI today is a \u201cwell established\u201d organised terrorist group, similar to its affiliate Al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the 9/11 attacks in the United States.\n\u201cIslamist groups and jihadists have seen the region to be a \u2018safe haven\u2019 for establishing a regional caliphate. The threat of terrorism in Malaysia is not a resurgence. The rise of radicalism in Malaysia has been ongoing for decades.\n\u201cJI\u2019s current attack after 10 years tells you that the threat remains, and if JI confirms the attack, it will remind the region that the threat is far from over,\u201d said Mr Raj.\nHe said that the killing of the two police officers by a person believed to be a naturalised Malaysian of Indonesian origin, is a wake-up call for Malaysia\u2019s law enforcement.\nThe incident took place at 2.45am at the Ulu Tiram police station with the attacker slashing the neck of a constable with a parang, killing him and then taking his gun. He then opened fire on two other officers, killing one of them and injuring the other.\nThe injured officer managed to kill the suspect, who has not been identified, in the shootout.\nInspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain told the media that the police arrested 20 suspected JI members, including the killer\u2019s five family members aged between 19 and 62.\nMr Singh also pointed out that there are still many questions that remain unanswered, such as whether the killer acted alone or was part of a larger group.\n\u201cWas there a mastermind behind him, how extensive is their current network in Malaysia and the region? The authorities must find out,\u201d he said."}
