The Federal Court subsequently upheld the conviction and sentence on Aug 23, 2022.\nMr Shafee said: \u201cThe counsel (Mr Hisyam) said it\u2019s not the fault of his client (Najib) but it is his fault because he had misjudged the timing (between taking over the matter and the hearing dates). So why punish my client?\u201d\nHe said the apex court should have allowed Mr Hisyam to discharge himself, but instead, it forced the lawyer to remain on record as the lead counsel.\n\u201cThis goes against every rubric of law and jurisdiction of the court,\u201d Mr Shafee said.\nMr Hisyam was still present during the final appeal proceedings. But this, Mr Shafee said, \u201cwas decorative at best\u201d and \u201cnot sanctioned by law\u201d.\n\u201cAnd that is reviewable because that goes against the very root of fair trial, \u201d he said.\nNajib is also seeking a review of the court\u2019s decision to dismiss his attempt to postpone his appeal hearing, as well as its decision not to recuse Tun Tengku Maimun from the Federal Court appeal due to Facebook posts made by her husband in May 2018.\nThe latter had allegedly demonstrated negative views of Najib\u2019s leadership and had concluded that he had siphoned funds from 1MDB into his personal bank account."}
