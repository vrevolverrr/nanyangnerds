WWA is an international group of scientists and meteorologists that studies the role of climate change in extreme weather events.\nThe study also found that fossil fuels \u2013 the primary cause of climate change \u2013 have made hurricanes like Helene 2.5 times more likely to occur.\nIn other words, storms of Helene\u2019s magnitude were formerly anticipated once every 130 years, but now the probability is closer to once every 53 years, on average.\nAnd yet, the research comes as the south-eastern US state of Florida prepares for the arrival of another major hurricane, Milton, just 10 days after it was hit by Helene.\nMilton, a maximum Category 5 storm, was generating maximum sustained winds of 270 kmh, the National Hurricane Centre said. US President Joe Biden has begged Florida residents to flee Hurricane Milton, warning that the storm could turn into the worst natural disaster to hit the state in a century.\nTo conduct the study on Helene, the WWA researchers focused on three aspects of the storm: precipitation, winds and the water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 a key factor in its formation.\n\u201cAll aspects of this event were amplified by climate change to different degrees,\u201d Dr Ben Clarke, a co-author of the study and researcher at Imperial College London, told a press conference.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see more of the same as the world continues to warm,\u201d he continued.\nDestruction\nHelene made landfall in north-western Florida on Sept 26 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 225 kph.\nThe storm then moved north, causing heavy rain and devastating floods in several states, including North Carolina, where it claimed the highest death toll.\nThe authors of the study emphasised that the risk posed by hurricanes has increased in scope beyond coastal areas.\nChief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky at NGO Climate Central said Helene \u201chad so much intensity\u201d that it would take time for it to lose strength, but the \u201cstorm was moving fast... so it could go farther inland pretty quickly.\u201d.\nThis study used three methodologies to examine the three aspects of the storm, and was conducted by researchers from the United States, Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands.\nTo study its rainfall, researchers used an approach based on both observation and climate models, depending on the two regions involved: one for coastal areas like Florida, and another for inland areas like the Appalachian mountains.\nIn both cases, the study found precipitation had increased by 10 per cent because of global warming, which is currently at 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This is the global average temperature increase for the planet\u2019s surface on land and the oceans.\nTo study Helene\u2019s winds, scientists looked at hurricane data dating back as far as 1900.\nThey determined Helene\u2019s winds were 11 per cent stronger, or 21 kmh, as a result of climate change.\nLastly, the researchers examined the water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico, where Helene formed, finding it was around 2 deg Celsius above normal.\nThis record temperature was made 200 to 500 times more likely due to climate change, the study said.\nWarmer oceans release more water vapour, providing more energy for storms as they form.\n\u201cIf humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more destructive hurricanes,\u201d Dr Clarke warned in a statement.
