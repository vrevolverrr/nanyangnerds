Moscow denies doing this.\nFurther restrictions to European gas supplies would heighten an energy crunch that has already sent wholesale gas prices soaring over 400 per cent since last August, creating a painful cost-of-living crisis for consumers and businesses and forcing governments to spend billions to ease the burden.\nUnlike last month's 10-day maintenance for Nord Stream 1, the upcoming work was announced less than two weeks in advance and is being carried out by Gazprom not Nord Stream AG, focusing on the last operating turbine at the station.\nMoscow, which slashed supply via Nord Stream 1 to 40 per cent of capacity in June and to 20 per cent in July, blames maintenance issues and sanctions it says prevent the return and installation of equipment.\nGazprom said the latest shutdown is needed to perform maintenance on the pipeline's only remaining compressor.\nYet Russia has also cut off supply to Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Poland completely, and reduced flows via other pipelines since launching what Moscow calls its\"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\"Given events over recent months, we think the market may disregard Gazprom's comments and start to consider whether the pipeline may not return to service, or at the very least may (be) delayed for any given reason,\" said Mr Biraj Borkhataria, Associate Director of European Research at Royal Bank of Canada.\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck, on a mission to replace Russian gas imports by mid-2024, earlier this month said that Nord Stream was \"fully operational\" and that there were no technical issues as claimed by Moscow.\nMr Klaus Mueller, president of Germany's network regulator, said that while a resumption of flows would help Germany's security of supply, no one was able to say what the consequences would be if flows remained at zero.\nEurope's largest economy is making better progress than expected in filling its gas storage facilities, but it's not enough to get the country through winter, he said.\nThe reduced flows via Nord Stream have complicated efforts across Europe to fill up vital gas storage facilities, a key strategic goal to make it through the winter months, when governments fear Russia may halt flows altogether.\n\"It is something of a miracle that gas filling levels in Germany have continued to rise nonetheless,\" Commerzbank analysts wrote, adding Germany had so far been successful at buying sufficient volumes at higher prices elsewhere.\nIn the meantime, however, some Europeans are voluntarily cutting their energy consumption, including limiting their use of electrical appliances and showering at work to save money while companies are bracing for possible rationing."}
