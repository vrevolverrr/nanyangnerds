Here\u2019s what we know right now", "tags": "asia", "timestamp": "2022-11-08", "content": "BEIJING - Speculation about the fate of China\u2019s Covid Zero policy has reached fever pitch.\nAfter President Xi Jinping defended the strategy in his much-anticipated Communist Party congress address in October, investors were left wondering what comes next as the lockdowns and blanket testing that are the hallmark of Covid Zero continued.\nIn the absence of a clear outlook on when it will all end, traders have seized on what they see as signs of progress, with an unverified screenshot of mysterious origins claiming China was making detailed plans to reopen stoking a US$450 billion (S$630 billion) rally last week.\nThe rumours continued into the weekend, ahead of a briefing by China\u2019s National Health Commission, where newfound buzz about a Covid Zero exit plan was punctured by officials saying they were resolutely adhering to the strategy.\nWith markets continuing to whipsaw, and decoding China\u2019s intentions key to everything from the fortunes of beaten-down domestic stocks to the global economic outlook, we\u2019ve brought together what we know about the controversial strategy going forward:\nHas anything changed to suggest China is adjusting its Covid policies?\nSince Mr Xi\u2019s speech at the Party congress, there have been some solid indications that Chinese officials have at least started a dialogue about how to ease the more isolationist aspects of Covid Zero.\nOfficials are debating how they may go about further reducing mandatory hotel quarantine for incoming travellers, Bloomberg News reported last month.\nThe aviation regulator has also encouraged state-owned carriers to add more flights, and officials are considering scrapping a system that penalises airlines for bringing a certain number of Covid-positive passengers into China.\nAll of these \u2013 while largely at the discussion or planning stage \u2013 point to a desire to ease up at the border.\nOn the vaccine front, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave the first indication that China may be willing to roll out more effective, foreign Covid-19 shots \u2013 seen by many as key to being able to reopen without a mass wave of deaths \u2013 when he said on Friday the country had agreed to make BioNTech\u2019s vaccine available to foreigners living there. Mr Scholz said it was a potential first step toward wider adoption in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nBioNTech confirmed Monday that it\u2019s in \u201cpositive\u201d discussions with Chinese authorities, though it was too early to give any details on the expat vaccination programme, or any wider approval in China for its Covid-19 shot.\nSo is China getting ready to end Covid Zero \u2013 or just tweak it?\nThat\u2019s unclear. While relaxing border curbs could help reduce China\u2019s isolation from the rest of the world, it won\u2019t address the more economically-damaging aspects of Covid Zero.\nIt is, however, hard to find concrete signs of China easing its internal Covid-19 playbook of lockdowns, curbs on domestic travel and frequent mass testing.\nWhile Beijing has ramped up its directive for local officials to make Covid Zero less obtrusive, that seems to have mainly resulted in restrictions going under the radar.\nWhat are Chinese officials and state media actually saying about Covid Zero now?\nWhat they\u2019ve always been saying: Officials are sticking to the script, with no cracks in the party line that Covid Zero is the correct approach for China and the government will implement it \u201cunswervingly.\u201d\nInvestors have been trying very hard to read between the lines of how state media and the authorities talk about Covid-19, jumping on what seem to be milder descriptions of the virus as representing a change in the propaganda. While a rhetorical shift is definitely a key indicator to watch for, the recent instances seized on are weak.\nFor example, some traders passed around an article posted on Party mouthpiece The People\u2019s Daily\u2019s health app in which the China CDC\u2019s chief epidemiologist Wu Zunyou appeared to downplay the risk of contracting long Covid. But those comments were made in October, and the article merely conveyed the observations of a Hong Kong-based expert that the definition of long Covid is still in doubt.\nSimilarly, much was made of the local health authority in Henan province describing Covid-19 as a \u201cself-limiting\u201d disease on Oct 31, meaning it can resolve without treatment. But as analysts at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, led by Greater China chief economist Raymond Yeung, wrote in a note on Monday, the phrase is not new, has been used before in China and is irrelevant for the parameters that Beijing focuses on.\n\u201cIt means the immune system can develop antibodies to combat the virus,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cHowever, policy makers are still concerned about the impact of long Covid and the burden on medical facilities.\u201d\nWhy the reluctance to pivot despite vaccines and antiviral drugs to treat Covid-19?\nMuch has been made of the fact that China\u2019s vaccines are not as effective as Western mRNA shots and that may account for its reluctance to exit Covid Zero.\nBut the country\u2019s homegrown vaccines are highly effective in preventing fatalities. What\u2019s likelier to be the issue is that even with inoculations and antiviral pills like Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid \u2013 which China is producing domestically \u2013 there still remains a small chance of dying from Covid.\nIn China\u2019s vast population, that could amount to millions of deaths, which would be problematic for Mr Xi. He\u2019s held up China\u2019s vastly lower Covid-19 death toll as supreme evidence of the policy\u2019s rectitude, especially compared with the United States.\nThere has been some news on the vaccine front, with Friday\u2019s BioNTech development preceded by the approval and rollout in some cities of a nasal vaccine from Chinese company CanSino Inc.\nBut despite that, the country\u2019s vaccination rate has plateaued, with rates among the elderly still lower than in other countries. Their fears are less about how the vaccine is administered and more around whether it can have adverse effects if taken when you have another medical condition, as many older people tend to.\nIt\u2019s also possible that China\u2019s top leaders may simply be reluctant to allow the virus to spread freely until the risk of death drops further, either through the emergence of an even milder virus variant than Omicron, or the development of even more effective vaccines and antivirals."}
