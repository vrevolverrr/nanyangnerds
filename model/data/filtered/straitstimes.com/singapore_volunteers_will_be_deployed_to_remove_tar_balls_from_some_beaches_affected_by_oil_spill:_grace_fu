They are scattered across the affected beaches and it is a labour-intensive process to pick them up,\u201d said Ms Fu.\n\u201cWe are calling all volunteers to come forward to help our cleaning staff to comb and remove tar balls from the beaches,\u201d she said, urging people to join in the \u201cbiggest beach cleanup exercise in Singapore\u201d.\n\u201cPersonally, I am quite excited to do this because I have always liked to play with sand,\u201d added Ms Fu.\n\u201cThe sooner we can clear these tar balls, the sooner we can enjoy our beautiful beaches.\u201d\nAs at June 24, more than 1,500 volunteers had signed up to help with oil spill management efforts, and more than 2,000 others have registered to be kept closely updated on ongoing efforts and future volunteering opportunities.\nThe Straits Times has contacted the National Environment Agency (NEA) \u2013 an agency under Ms Fu\u2019s ministry \u2013 and the Sentosa Development Corporation, which manages the beaches on the resort island, for more details.\nOn June 14, the Netherlands-flagged dredging boat Vox Maxima hit stationary bunker vessel Marine Honour at Pasir Panjang Terminal after suffering a sudden loss of engine and steering control.\nThis caused 400 tonnes of low-sulphur oil from one of Marine Honour\u2019s tanks to leak into the sea, affecting numerous coastlines, including East Coast Park, Keppel Bay, the Southern Islands and Sentosa.\nAccording to a July 2 statement from the authorities, other affected beaches, including Tanjong and Palawan beaches on Sentosa, as well as the remaining areas of East Coast Park, are in the second phase of cleanup operations.\nSince the spill, more than 700 personnel from various government agencies and private organisations have been deployed to help in cleanup efforts, and more than 3,400m of containment booms \u2013 devices used to control the spread of oil \u2013 were laid.\nThe public is still advised against swimming and primary contact water activities at beaches in East Coast Park and on Sentosa, as well as in the waters off the Southern Islands, \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, according to government advisories.\nOne Degree 15 Marina and Marina at Keppel Bay, which were closed after the incident, reopened for regular operations on June 25 and 28, respectively.\nDuring a press conference on oil spill cleanup efforts on June 24, Ms Fu said that the authorities plan to involve volunteers working alongside cleaning personnel in the final phase of the operation to accelerate the reopening of Singapore\u2019s beaches.\nVolunteers will receive training and protective equipment before embarking on cleanup efforts at the various beaches, she said then."}
