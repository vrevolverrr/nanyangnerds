Prices for existing homes near Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s headquarters in Hangzhou have dropped about 25 per cent from late 2021 highs, according to local agents.\nWhile it is difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons, industry insiders and economists say China\u2019s official home price indexes are likely understating the depth of the downturn, in part because of longstanding methodologies that struggle to capture market turning points.\nThis is heightening concern among investors about the availability of timely economic data in China, where access to some information has become increasingly restricted under the government of President Xi Jinping. It also raises questions about whether policymakers themselves have an accurate understanding of the market as they devise measures to prop up demand. Another risk is that wary home buyers stay on the sidelines, waiting for price declines to show up in the data before they step in.\nAnalysts say the methodology, which partly relies on surveys rather than price data from transactions, helps the authorities to smooth the trend and avoid large swings. By contrast, in the United States, the widely cited S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller indexes use home price data collected at local deed recording offices across the country.\nFor Dr Henry Chin, who has spent more than 20 years researching global real estate markets, the data\u2019s source and accuracy are critical.\n\u201cHome price data in many countries are based on total market transactions, yet China uses selective samples,\u201d said Dr Chin, the head of research for Asia-Pacific at CBRE Group. \u201cWhen a market goes down, the true market condition is hard to be reflected in such data.\u201d\nChina\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has said in an online explanation that raw data on new home prices is based on all sales and purchases registered in local housing transaction bodies. Existing home prices, though, are based on both sales of key projects and surveys, it said. The NBS uses the Laspeyres price index, a common formula used worldwide, to calculate its 70-city home price gauge, it told Bloomberg. Market watchers say the methodology on sampling and index calculation remains ambiguous.\nSurvey-based data \u201cserves a purpose of avoiding extreme fluctuation\u201d, said Dr Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. \u201cBut when people are wary that prices are falling even more, thus not buying, such data defeats its own purpose.\u201d\nPrice slides\nIn Hangzhou, close to where Alibaba is headquartered, home prices in some neighborhoods are down 25 per cent to 28 per cent from a peak around October 2021, agents said. In Lianyang, a downtown area popular with expats and financiers in Shanghai, residential prices have slid 15 per cent to 20 per cent from record highs in mid-2021, they said.\nEven as at March, before a fresh slowdown, more than half of tier-2 and tier-3 cities saw existing home prices fall more than 15 per cent from peaks, Guolian Securities economists wrote in a report, citing data by housing transaction services provider KE Holdings. Actual declines from peaks could be sharper as the agency compiles only data starting from November 2018, the economists cautioned.\nTop cities, once considered resilient against a housing downturn, are not immune. Prices of existing homes in at least five popular districts of Shenzhen have slumped 15 per cent in the past three years, according to a July report by property research institute Leyoujia. The southern hub is the country\u2019s least affordable housing market."}
