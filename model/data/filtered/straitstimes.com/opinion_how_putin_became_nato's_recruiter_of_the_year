{"title": "How Putin became Nato's recruiter of the year", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2022-05-17", "content": "A doctored photo making the rounds on social media pretends to show Russian President Vladimir Putin smiling broadly as he receives from Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary-General of Nato, a prize for being \"Nato's Recruiter of the Year\".\nA prank, of course, but one that points to one of Europe's bitter ironies. President Putin's ostensible reason for invading Ukraine was to prevent that country from joining the US-led military alliance in Europe, an organisation he regards as a fundamental threat to Russia. Yet not only has he failed to subdue Ukraine, but his invasion has persuaded Finland and Sweden - two European nations that until now have kept out of all military alliances - to join Nato. A bigger own goal for Russia can hardly be imagined."}
