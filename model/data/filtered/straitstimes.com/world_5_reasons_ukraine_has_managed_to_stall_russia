Preparation\nUkraine, with Western help, substantially bolstered its armed forces after 2014, when Russia occupied the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in a lightning operation and pro-Russia separatists overran parts of the east of the country.\nIn 2016, Nato and Kyiv began a training programme for Ukrainian special forces, who now number 2,000 and have been able to help civilian volunteers.\n\"Ukrainians have spent the last eight years planning, training, and equipping themselves for resisting a Russian occupation,\" said Douglas London, adjunct associate professor at Georgetown University.\nUnderstanding that the US and Nato won't come to its rescue on the battlefield, Ukraine's strategy has focused \"on bleeding Moscow so as to make occupation untenable,\" the CIA veteran wrote in Foreign Affairs.\n2. Local knowledge\nRussia, relying on Soviet-era familiarity with an area that Moscow controlled under the USSR, appears to have underestimated the Ukrainian forces' home-turf advantage.\nThis included both knowledge of the terrain - at a time of the year when tracks can turn to mud - and the capacity of locals to themselves take up arms against the invading forces.\nIn such a scenario of irregular warfare, weaker forces can maximise the advantages they have over their stronger opponents - \"advantages of terrain, local knowledge, and social connections,\" said Spencer Meredith, professor at the College of International Security Affairs.\nChallenges will mount further if urban fighting develops when Russia seeks to penetrate inside cities like Kyiv.\n\"That changes everything,\" said the French military source. \"The Russians will run into trouble at every street corner, building by building.\"\n4. Strategic errors\nMilitary analysts say Russia made strategic errors in the early days of the invasion after it was launched on Feb 24, sending in too few ground troops in the initial phase and failing to get ground and air forces working in tandem.\nIt appears Moscow expected to achieve military success within days.\n\"At the outset they thought they could introduce units very quickly into the capital Kyiv... But very early on they got bloody noses,\" said Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Programme at the Centre for Naval Analyses in the US.\n\"The assumptions were ridiculous... how could you take Kyiv in three days? The Russian military has now adjusted and is trying to conduct this as a combined arms operation,\" he said.\n5. Psychological fear\nRussia has set alarm bells ringing across the world by keeping tens of thousands of troops deployed close to the border with Ukraine over recent weeks.\nBut it is possible that few had any idea they were about to be sent to war in a neighbouring country whose inhabitants are fellow Slavs and where many speak Russian as their mother tongue.\nMorale will not have been helped by heavy Russian casualties who, according to the French source, have included at least one major general - a sign the top military elite has felt compelled to visit the frontline.\nTom Pepinsky, non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said evidence so far suggested that Ukraine's treatment of Russian prisoners of war could become harsher as the invaders press further into the country.\n\"The Ukrainian resistance will be most effective if Russians are on edge, sleepless, and prone to overreactions,\" he said.\nFollow The Straits Times' live coverage on the Ukraine crisis here."}
