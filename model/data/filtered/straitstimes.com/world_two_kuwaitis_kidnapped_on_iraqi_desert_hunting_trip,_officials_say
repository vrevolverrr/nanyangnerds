The statement followed a phone call between the two ministers on Dec 25.\nIraqi security officials said an initial investigation showed that one of the hunters\u2019 vehicles was attacked by gunmen and contact had been lost with the two Kuwaitis.\nThe desert region is known to be a hiding place for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militant groups that are still active, the two security sources said.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the incident. Hunters from wealthy Gulf states often make trips to Iraq\u2019s southern and western desert in search of hawks.\nOne police officer told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the Kuwaitis had been in an extensive desert area that is very dangerous because Daesh (another name for ISIS) is still active there.
