And what we were looking at is what levels their metabolism is at when they're swimming, compared to inactive,\" Mr Kelly said.\nThe researchers soon noticed that after about five minutes of rest, the metabolic rate of the shark dropped, and its posture made a clear shift.\n\"They go from sort of sitting up on their pectoral fins with their heads up on the ground, to just lying completely flat,\"Mr Kelly said, adding that this behaviour correlated directly with a drop in metabolism.\n\"So, we debunked the idea that they had to have their eyes closed, but certainly posture and metabolism were spot on.\"\nMr Kelly said the discovery would open up new avenues by which \"we could study sleep, and how it has evolved from prehistoric animals all the way to humans\".\nHe added: \"We all do it (sleep), every animal studied thus far does. It's survived over evolutionary time, even though it's like a super risky behaviour to engage in.\n\"So that suggests that sleep really is serving either a number of or maybe one all-encompassing function. But we still haven't gotten to the bottom of that.\""}
