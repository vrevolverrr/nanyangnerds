The plan, known as PDP8, would raise the country\u2019s total installed power generation capacity to more than 150GW by 2030, from more than 80GW at the end of 2023.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade is now seeking opinions to update the PDP8, state media reported in early September.\nThe government office document said relevant ministries and agencies had also been told to remove hurdles facing offshore wind and gas-fired power development, without elaborating.
