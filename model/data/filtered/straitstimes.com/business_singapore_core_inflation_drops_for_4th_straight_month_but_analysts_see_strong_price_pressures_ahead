Opec+ refers to the oil producer group comprising the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus allies.\nOil prices have surged more than 25 per cent since end-June, thanks to major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia extending their production cuts till year end and a brighter economic outlook for the United States.\nThe surge has rekindled talk of the possibility of US$100 a barrel crude, while increasing price pressures for importers.\nSaid Ms Selena Ling, OCBC Bank\u2019s chief economist: \u201cIf energy prices sustain at current elevated levels, there could still be upward adjustments to household electricity tariffs for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\u201cMoreover, the cost of delivering water has gone up and will likely continue to rise, following the last review of water prices in 2017 that saw a jump of 30 per cent over two years.\u201d\nMs Ling added that any expectations for MAS to ease monetary policy or to adopt an even more dovish stance \u201cmay still be premature\u201d.\nBank of America Asia and Asean economist Ang Kai Wei said in a note that he expects MAS to keep its monetary policy on hold for some time, as past tightening moves will likely be seen as sufficient in supporting the latter stages of disinflation.\n\u201cWe also expect no change to foreign exchange settings in 2024, but the risk is skewed towards a steeper slope to deliver more durable tightening,\u201d he added.\nMonday\u2019s data showed private transport inflation recorded the steepest increase to 6.3 per cent in August, from 4.8 per cent in July. Cars saw a bigger hike in prices, while petrol prices recorded a smaller decline.\nElectricity and gas costs continued to fall, but at a slower pace at 1.4 per cent. Inflation for food and retail continued to ease, falling in August to 4.8 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.\nServices inflation fell to 3.1 per cent in August, on the back of smaller hikes in holiday expenses, telecommunications, recreational and cultural services costs, as well as a larger decline in airfares.\nAccommodation inflation edged down to 4.4 per cent as the pace of increase in housing rents eased."}
