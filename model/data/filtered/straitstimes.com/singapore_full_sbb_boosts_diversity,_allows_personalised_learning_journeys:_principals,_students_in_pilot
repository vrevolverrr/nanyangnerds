They want to progress together to the next level.\u201d\nKranji Secondary School principal Goh Soon Hoe said schools have the autonomy to design the implementation of full SBB based on the profile of their students.\n\u201cWe are no longer just requiring our students to know about academic subjects. We want them to be connected to the realities of what this world means, and then prepare them for the future,\u201d he said.\nAt Holy Innocents\u2019 High School, all Sec 1 students will study literature as part of the common curriculum. Principal Rebecca Chew said this was done to expose students to the literary nuances in prose, poetry and drama, which they would not have encountered if they were in the N(T) stream.\n\u201cThis is one of the good things about full SBB \u2013 we can do away with the national curriculum combination and students can have access to other kinds of subjects,\u201d she said.\nEthan Chiow, who is in Sec 1 at the school, was recently given the opportunity to take mathematics at a more demanding level in Term 3 this year. He also takes science and English at a higher level."}
