Taken together, they point to a still-underperforming economy in need of more policy support.\nThe Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI stayed at 50.8 in January, unchanged from December and surpassing analysts\u2019 forecasts of 50.6. The 50-point mark in the purchasing managers\u2019 index separates growth from contraction.\n\u201cQuicker logistics, increased procurement, and rising inventories reflected improved business confidence,\u201d said Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe.\nHowever, he noted that employment remained in contraction, price levels were subdued and \u201cdeflationary pressures persisted\u201d.\nPolicymakers in China face a daunting task as they try to revitalise the economy in the face of a property downturn, local government debt risks, deflationary pressures and tepid overseas demand.\nThe crisis-hit property sector was dealt a fresh blow this week after a Hong Kong court ordered the liquidation of the debt-laden developer China Evergrande Group.\nBut the Caixin survey offered some hope that external demand may be starting to improve with new export orders increasing for the first time since June 2023, though marginally.\nThe export index may have been affected by the Chinese New Year, which will fall on Feb 10 in 2024, as factories and workers geared up for the pre-holiday shipment of goods.\nMoreover, forecasts of stronger global demand, planned investment, new product release and efforts to expand into new markets drove manufacturers\u2019 confidence to their highest since April 2023.\nBut factories continued to trim their workforce in January, while efforts to attract and secure new orders prompted them to cut product selling prices.\nHeightened deflationary pressures have raised investor bets for further monetary easing after China announced a deep cut to bank reserves last week to support the economy and a plunging stock market.
