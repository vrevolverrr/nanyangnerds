Safety code violations can lead to jail terms for fatal accidents.\nAricell chief executive Park Soon-kwan apologised on June 25 for the fire but said the company had complied with all safety regulations and training requirements.\nFlames quickly engulfed the factory, where 35,000 lithium batteries were stored, and the spread of toxic smoke probably rendered workers unconscious within seconds, fire officials have said.\nOnly three of the dead, all of them South Korean men, have been identified. The rest, including 17 Chinese people, have yet to be identified as their bodies suffered severe damage in the fire.\nInvestigators are trying to determine the cause of the blaze amid questions about Aricell\u2019s hiring of foreign workers on a temporary basis and whether they received adequate safety training.\nThe office of a lawmaker, Mr Kim Sung-hoi, provided a copy of a March inspection report by the Hwaseong fire department that showed it had flagged serious risks, including possible \u201crapid combustion\u201d at the building where the fire broke out.\nConfirming the inspection report, an official at the fire department said fire officials had also visited the company on June 5 to consult on fire prevention.\nSet up in 2020, Aricell has 48 full-time employees and makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices.\nIt also supplies batteries to the military for use in some communication and crypto devices, a spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s defence procurement agency said.\nThe agency\u2019s annual safety inspections cover suppliers in some categories, such as firearms and chemicals, but exclude battery makers such as Aricell, the spokesperson added.\nIts parent company, S-Connect, supplies lithium-ion battery parts to Samsung SDI, one of the country\u2019s major secondary battery makers.
