A total of $32.2 billion was invested out of the $580 billion in CPF assets as at March 2024.\nMorningstar data showed that unit trusts in the scheme returned 9.71 per cent in the year to June 30, marginally better than the 9.68 per cent return from investment-linked insurance products. The overall performance of CPFIS-included funds fell to 3.11 per cent in the second quarter from 4.88 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\nGlobal equities rose 3.06 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, with the MSCI AC Asia excluding Japan delivering 7.65 per cent. Bond returns eased slightly to a negative 1.17 per cent for investors.\nOn a three-year cumulative basis, CPFIS funds returned a negative 2.26 per cent compared with the MSCI World Index\u2019s positive 23.02 per cent return.\nUnit trusts posted net inflows into Singapore of $1.8 billion in the three months to June 30, up 88.9 per cent from $975.3 million in the preceding quarter. Every asset class registered positive net flows except for convertibles in the three months to June 30, according to Morningstar.\nFixed income remained the focus of investors and led the pack, attracting net inflows of $906.94 million. A lot of the money was garnered by popular funds like Pimco Income fund, followed by Asia bond funds.\nSingapore investors piled back into cash amid market volatility. Money market inflows jumped 70 per cent in the second quarter of 2024 compared with the preceding three months to $622.2 million."}
