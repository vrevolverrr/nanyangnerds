She was a very good, kind and helpful woman. Why did they do this to her?\" \"They bomb and they bomb and we don't know what to do.\"\nTheir leafy street lined with mulberry and cherry trees lies close to Russian forces just across the river, with Ukrainian artillery positioned nearby. One house was completely obliterated by earlier shelling and an unexploded device could be seen sticking out of the road.\nThey were not the only Lysychansk residents to die on Sunday: a six-year-old boy was also killed, police told AFP, showing a photo of the crater from the shell, which scattered deadly shrapnel.\nIn the city centre, severed power cables lay in the street, with burnt-out shopping malls and the acrid smell of smoke in a yellow sky.\nIn one street, smoke rose from charred, roofless houses.\nSoldiers and police drove cars with missing windows and AFP saw police haul in three youths with sacks full of looted goods.\n'The pits'\nOne policeman described the situation as \"the pits\".\n\"Shells are flying in and hitting the city centre,\" he said, while his colleague added: \"It's 24/7.\" \"With every day, you see for yourself that the shelling doesn't diminish, it is only intensifying,\" Oleksandr Pokhna, a lieutenant-colonel in Luhansk region's police special forces, told AFP.\nHe said police were trying to encourage as many residents as possible to go to evacuation points to be taken to safer parts of the country.\nSome called for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\"Can't we come to an agreement, without weapons? We need to make an effort to make an agreement,\" said a woman named Galina.\nMany, seeing only Ukrainian forces and completely cut off from sources of information, insisted that Kyiv's troops were responsible for the shelling.\nOne angry woman, who declined to give her name, said: \"It's the Ukrainians bombing us. They don't consider us to be people. They call us separatists.\"\n\"It was our own people - the Ukrainians,\" an elderly man agreed.\nMany locals in the Donbas coal-mining region feel little connection to Kyiv, and talk of taking \"trips\" to Ukraine.\nSpecial forces police officer Pokhna acknowledged this mood but stressed: \"The Ukrainian army is only defending itself.\""}
