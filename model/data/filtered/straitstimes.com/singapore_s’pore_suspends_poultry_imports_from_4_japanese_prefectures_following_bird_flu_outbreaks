The ban began taking effect between Nov 25 and Dec 3, SFA added.\nPoultry products that have been heat-treated to inactivate the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus according to the World Organisation for Animal Health\u2019s guidelines are exempted from the ban, the agency said.\nJapan detected its first case of the HPAI virus this season at a poultry farm in the southern prefecture of Saga on Nov 24.\nOn Nov 27, the virus was also detected at a poultry farm in the eastern prefecture of Ibaraki.\nThis came after Japan experienced its worst bird flu outbreak during the last season for the disease, which started in October 2022. A record 17.7 million poultry birds were culled, leading to a drop in the supply of poultry and eggs and a sharp rise in their prices. Local governments and farmers also lamented the shortage of land to bury the huge number of dead chickens.\nSeveral other countries, such as the United States, the Netherlands and Germany, have also reported recent HPAI outbreaks. Singapore\u2019s temporary poultry import restrictions apply to these countries as well, according to other circulars issued by SFA.\nSFA said it works with various stakeholders in the food industry to diversify sources of commonly consumed food, including chicken.\n\u201cThis ensures that disruptions from any single source do not affect Singapore too severely, as importers can turn to alternative sources to maintain stability of our food supply,\u201d the agency said.\nSFA also encourages consumers to be flexible in their food options in the event of such disruptions."}
