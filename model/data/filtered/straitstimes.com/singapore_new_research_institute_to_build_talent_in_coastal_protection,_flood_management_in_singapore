Around 30 per cent of Singapore\u2019s land area is less than 5m above mean sea level.\nThe new Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore was launched by national water agency PUB and the National University of Singapore (NUS). It will bring together expertise from various local universities, research institutes and industry players to create innovative coastal protection solutions.\nSpeaking at a dialogue at the launch at NUS, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu noted that there are a lot of uncertainties in measuring the impact of climate change on Singapore.\n\u201cSo, we have to look at this in a very dynamic way\u2026 if we do this too early, (and end up) protecting us too much, you waste a lot of resources. But if you made it too late, too little, you are not going to be in time,\u201d said Ms Fu.\n\u201cSimilarly, if you build the coastal protection solution too low, then you will find that, several generations later, you will need to enhance it,\u201d she added.\nPUB chief executive Goh Si Hou said the CFI is the heart of PUB\u2019s $125 million Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme, and it will serve as the focal point to anchor and grow a collaborative research ecosystem in coastal protection.\nThis comes amid ongoing islandwide site-specific studies to determine the most suitable coastal protection measures for each of the eight different segments of coastlines.\nCFI Singapore has begun its work with nine research projects in four areas \u2013 coastal science research; monitoring, prediction and digitalisation of the coastal environment; innovative engineering solutions; and integrated nature-based solutions.\nFor example, one project will test the efficacy of hybrid nature-based solutions for coastal protection, such as perched beaches with seagrass meadows, and mangroves with rock revetments. Another project will focus on using modular solutions to enhance existing coastal protection infrastructure.\nEach project will involve an expert as the principal investigator, and will be supported by several collaborators drawn from local and foreign universities, as well as industry players.\nThe centre will also look into the suitable conditions for mangroves, seagrasses and corals to grow \u2013 especially in a hybrid configuration \u2013 and their survivability under various climate change scenarios.\nMs Hazel Khoo, director of PUB\u2019s coastal protection department, said: \u201cWe are a low-lying island with a high population density and limited land. With many competing land uses, our coastal areas are precious to us.\n\u201cOur goal is to ensure our coastlines are not only well-protected, but can bring multi-functional value for Singapore.\u201d\nThe different coastal protection solutions will be implemented at each of the coastlines progressively, starting with the City-East Coast, which already has some natural coastal features.\nOther areas include the Changi aviation hub, the recreational space at East Coast Park and the Greater Southern Waterfront, said Ms Khoo.\nFocus group discussions will be held in October where members of the public can share their feedback on some shortlisted coastal protection solutions.\nThese could potentially include hybrid solutions integrating seawalls and revetments with natural ecosystems like mangroves, barrages, and even land reclamation bolstered with sea bunds to double as a coastal protection measure.\nMs Khoo said that PUB will be sharing with the public the trade-offs of these solutions, and their potential impact on the environment.\nExplaining how the CFI and the larger Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme will work in tandem with the nationwide site-specific studies, Ms Khoo said that some of the solutions developed by the CFI could first be tested in the laboratory, or as part of a small-scale pilot before being implemented along the coastlines.\nA living lab will also be included under the research programme, which will accelerate the adoption of coastal solutions by providing test-bedding sites.\nStudies for the City-East Coast began in 2021, and are expected to be completed by 2025.\nSuitable coastal adaptation measures for the area could then be implemented around 2030, she added."}
