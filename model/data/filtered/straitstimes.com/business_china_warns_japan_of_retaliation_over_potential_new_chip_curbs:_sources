One specific fear in Japan, Toyota Motor privately told officials in Tokyo, is that Beijing could react to new semiconductor controls by cutting Japan\u2019s access to critical minerals that are essential for automotive production, the people said.\nToyota is among the most important companies in Japan, and is deeply involved in the country\u2019s chip policy, partly reflected by the fact that it has invested in a new chip campus being built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Kumamoto, according to one of the people. That makes its concerns a major consideration for Japanese officials, in addition to those of Tokyo Electron, the semiconductor gear maker that would be principally affected by any new Japanese export controls.\nThe United States has been pressuring Japan to impose additional restrictions on the ability of firms including Tokyo Electron to sell advanced chipmaking tools to China, as part of a long-running campaign to curtail China\u2019s semiconductor progress. As part of those talks, senior US officials have been working with their Japanese counterparts on a strategy to ensure adequate supplies of critical minerals, some of the people said, especially since China imposed restrictions on the exports of gallium, germanium and graphite in 2023.\nThe concern about Toyota has some historical precedent. In 2010, China temporarily suspended exports of rare earths to Japan after a clash in waters of the East China Sea claimed by both sides. The move shook Japan\u2019s electronics sector and threatened to choke off global supplies of high-power magnets produced in Japan employing rare earths from China. Tokyo has since worked with mixed success to reduce its reliance on Chinese rare earth imports.\nThe Biden administration is confident that it can assuage Tokyo\u2019s concerns and reach an agreement with Japan by the end of 2024, some of the people said.\nBut there are more aggressive options: Behind the scenes, the US has been wielding a power known as the foreign direct product rule, or FDPR. The rule allows Washington to control sales of products made anywhere in the world, provided they use even the smallest amount of American technology.\nIn the current talks, American officials so far have refrained from invoking that authority against Japan and other key allies, which see the rule as a draconian step. A senior administration official said the US would prefer to reach a diplomatic solution but would not rule out the use of FDPR.\nThe timing of any deal is complicated by the US presidential election in November and the planned resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in September. But Mr Kishida stepping down should not impact the negotiations for further curbs, the senior administration official said, because Tokyo has built consensus for the policy across its government.\nJapan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry did not have immediate comment.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it opposes efforts by any individual nation to politicise normal trade and lure other countries to join any technology blockade against China.\nThe US first unveiled sweeping chip export controls in October 2022 \u2013 focused on both equipment and cutting-edge processors \u2013 and Japan and the Netherlands later followed suit with their own, less restrictive measures. Washington has since then been trying to convince allies to fully align with the original US controls, particularly by limiting Dutch supplier ASML Holding and Tokyo Electron\u2019s ability to repair restricted machines that are already in China \u2013 something US firms are barred from doing. The Hague is planning to impose some servicing restrictions, Bloomberg News has reported.\nNow, Washington is eyeing more US curbs on high-bandwidth memory chips \u2013 an essential AI component \u2013 and additional chipmaking tools, as well as measures targeting specific Chinese companies. That has triggered a second, parallel set of negotiations with officials in Japan and the Netherlands, as the US pressures both governments to match its potential new measures, which currently have a carve-out for allies.\nThe Biden administration is under pressure from US industry \u2013 and some lawmakers in its own party \u2013 to secure an agreement with key allies before moving ahead with its own measures.\nASML and Tokyo Electron have both posted large sales increases in China since the US imposed its rules. US firms including Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA have also continued to sell large amounts of gear to China, as businesses there stockpile less-advanced equipment in an effort to get ahead of potential new US restrictions.\nA senior US official downplayed the impact of stockpiling, saying it pertains only to less-advanced machinery and that Beijing\u2019s ability to innovate has been severely hampered by a lack of access to cutting-edge tools.
