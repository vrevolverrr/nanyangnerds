The Philippines has also expanded security cooperation with Japan, another key U.S. ally in East Asia, angering China.\n\"The Chinese side believes that defence cooperation between countries should not target any third party or disrupt regional peace and stability,\" Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for China's defence ministry, said on the ministry's social media account.\n\"The Philippines are inviting wolves into the house and willingly acting as their pawns, which is despised by other regional countries,\" Zhang said.\nSOUTH CHINA SEA\nTension between China and the Philippines has increased, in particular over disputed territories in the South China Sea.\nLast week, the Philippines accused China's air force of carrying out dangerous manoeuvres over the contested Scarborough Shoal. China maintains its aircraft operated lawfully and professionally.\nThe air incident came after Manila and Beijing agreed to better manage maritime disputes.\nManalo also said he hoped that China would honour its provisional arrangement with Manila over the latter's resupply missions to a beached vessel at another contested spot, the Second Thomas Shoal.\nChina has claimed most of the South China Sea as its territory, including the Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals.\nIt rejects a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that Beijing's expansive claims in the South China Sea had no basis under international law.\n\"We will take legitimate countermeasures against deliberate infringements and provocations to protect our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,\" Zhang said.
