This will be done.\u201d\nHe also claimed on Monday morning that the \u201cinitiators of this action are our enemies who organised it from Ukrainian territory\u201d, according to Russia\u2019s Ria-Novosti news agency.\nMr Melikov said the riots were instigated by posts on the Telegram messaging app from Utro Dagestan, run by \u201ctraitors\u201d working from Ukraine.\nUtro Dagestan, a Telegram channel with around 60,000 followers, shared a post urging a mass gathering at the airport to prevent the arrival of \u201cundesirable\u201d passengers on the Red Wings flight.\nDagestan and Chechnya are mainly Muslim areas in a region that has witnessed years of violent tension with the central Russian authorities.\nThe RIA Novosti news agency reported on Sunday that a Jewish centre in another North Caucasus republic \u2013 Kabardino-Balkaria \u2013 had been set on fire in the city of Nalchik.\nDagestan is Russia\u2019s southernmost territory and one of its poorest regions.\nIt has taken an active part in the Ukraine offensive \u2013 with independent reports showing it has sent proportionally more men to Ukraine than many more ethnically Russian regions.\nAFP, REUTERS"}
