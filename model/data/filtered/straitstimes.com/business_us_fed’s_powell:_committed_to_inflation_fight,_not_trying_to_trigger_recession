He declined to rule out a 100-basis-point move if it proved warranted.\n\u201cInflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store,\u201d he said, repeating that policymakers would need to be nimble in response to the incoming data.\n\u2018Coughing up bones\u2019\nSince the June 14-15 policy meeting, a number of Powell\u2019s fellow policymakers have lined up behind his comments last week that the central bank will very likely need to raise rates by either 50 or 75 basis points at its next meeting in July.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker said incoming data would govern which of the two options to deliver. Chicago Fed president Charles Evans signaled later on Wednesday that he also is comfortable for now with continued rapid rate hikes, even as he nodded to the rising recession risk.\n\u201cTo think that we can fine tune something like this with tremendous precision \u2013 I mean, we just don\u2019t have that ability,\u201d Evans said. Even so, he added, there\u2019s \u201ctremendous\u201d consensus at the Fed for getting rates into modestly restrictive territory.\n\u201cThe first thing that we\u2019re looking at is to make sure we take the steam out of the inflation pressures,\u201d he said.\nBut in an indication of how inflation has emerged as a thorny political issue that threatens to tip the balance of power in Congress to Republicans in elections this November, Powell found himself under fire from both the left and right.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat representing Massachusetts, took the Fed to task for pushing through rate hikes that raised the risk of a recession that could put millions out of work.\nRepublican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, in one of the more heated criticisms of the Fed\u2019s response to inflation, said inflation was hitting his constituents \u201cso hard they are coughing up bones.\u201d\nOverall, Powell did not stray far from his remarks in his news conference that followed the Fed\u2019s latest policy meeting, but his assertion that financial conditions had \u201ctightened significantly\u201d seems significant and may herald a slower pace of rate hikes, Karim Basta, chief economist at III Capital Management, wrote in a note.\nInterest rate futures ticked higher through the course of Powell\u2019s appearance, as traders moderated expectations for additional big rate increases at the Fed\u2019s remaining four policy meetings of the year.\nEconomists polled by Reuters before the appearance see the Fed delivering another 75-basis-point interest rate hike in July, followed by a half-percentage-point rise in September, with no scaling back to quarter-percentage-point moves until November at the earliest.\nFed officials\u2019 latest projections see economic growth slowing to below trend this year while the US unemployment rate \u2013 currently 3.6 per cent \u2013 starts to tick higher. Meanwhile, they now expect inflation by year-end to drop only to 5.2 per cent by their preferred measure, which registered 6.3 per cent as of April."}
