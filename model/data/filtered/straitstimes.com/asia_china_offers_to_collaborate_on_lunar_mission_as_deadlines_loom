Final selection of proposals will come in September 2024.\nThe Chang'e-8 mission will follow the Chang'e-7 in 2026, which also aims to search for lunar resources on the moon's south pole.\nThe two missions will lay the foundations for the construction of the Beijing-led International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) in the 2030s.\nChina, which deployed an uncrewed probe to the moon on the Chang'e-5 mission in 2020, plans to send an uncrewed Chang'e-6 probe to the far side of the moon in the first half of 2024 to retrieve soil samples.\nChina aims to land astronauts on the moon by 2030.\nChina's timeline to build an outpost on the south pole coincides with Nasa's more ambitious and advanced Artemis program, which aims to put US astronauts back on the lunar surface in December 2025, barring delays.\nOn the 2025 Artemis 3 mission, two US astronauts will land on the lunar south pole, a region previously unvisited by any human. The last time a human set foot on the moon was in 1972 under the US Apollo programme.\nThe crewed Artemis 4 and 5 missions are planned for 2027 and 2029, respectively.\nNasa is banned by US law from collaborating with China, directly or indirectly.\nAs of September, 29 countries - including India, which landed a probe near the moon's south pole in August - have signed the Artemis Accords, a pact crafted by Nasa and the US State Department aimed at establishing norms of behaviour in space and on the lunar surface.\nChina and Russia are not signatories of the agreement.\nChina, for its own lunar station program, has secured participation from only Russia and Venezuela so far.
