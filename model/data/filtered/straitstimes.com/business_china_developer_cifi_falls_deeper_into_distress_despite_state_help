This is a deeply distressed level, all the more striking given that the bond was trading above 89 cents less than three weeks ago.\nShares of the developer dropped 15 per cent drop to tie a record low.\nThe tumbles came as people familiar with the matter said that the developer is in discussions with banks to extend interest payment on an offshore loan.\nAdding to signs of strains, Moody's Investors Service cut its ratings on Thursday, citing CIFI's \"elevated refinancing risks\". S&P Global Ratings this week pulled its grades at the builder's request following two downgrades deeper into junk last month.\nThe problems at CIFI highlight the challenges for the Chinese authorities as they seek to prevent a slump in the property industry from fuelling broader financial market contagion, while also delivering on long-held goals of cutting excessive leverage and making homes more affordable.\nA crisis in developer debt that began with property giant China Evergrande Group two years ago has pushed yields on junk dollar bonds from the nation - most of which are from builders - above 25 per cent, effectively shutting them out of the market.\nPolicymakers have stepped up support for the troubled industry. CIFI is among a small group of builders that recently issued renminbi bonds under a scheme that emerged in August for a state-owned firm to guarantee some developers' new local debt sales.\nWhile that programme initially sparked a broad rally in Chinese junk debt, traders have more recently been looking for more supportive steps as signs of debt strains spread.\nWeak sentiment weighed on dollar bonds of other large Chinese builders, some of which have also sold state-guaranteed onshore notes.\nDebt from Country Garden Holdings, the country's biggest developer, fell nearly 5 cents, while investment-grade Longfor Group Holdings dropped three cents. Like CIFI, their notes on Thursday were on pace for the largest declines in a week.\n\"At the moment, investors do not have any certainty on market direction and policy effectiveness,\" said Ms Zhi Wei Feng, a senior analyst at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia. \"We will need to see sustained improvement in property sales and clarity on how the government will resolve the developers' funding issues.\" BLOOMBERG"}
