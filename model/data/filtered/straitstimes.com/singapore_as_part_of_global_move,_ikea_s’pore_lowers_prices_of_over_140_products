Its three Singapore stores yielded $384.2 million in sales.\nIn response to ST queries, an Ikea spokesman explained that the Inter Ikea Group is responsible for the range and supply for 12 Ikea franchisees around the world.\nMr Ring\u2019s comments refer to a projection of wholesale prices \u2013 not retail ones \u2013 that will be charged to retailers, such as Ikea Singapore, but the final in-store prices will vary from market to market.\nIn Singapore, this has resulted in a reduction of up to 20 per cent in prices of items like Malm drawers, Ikea Singapore retail director Gerard Jansen said.\nFor example, a Malm chest of six drawers is now priced at $199, down from $249, while the Kallax shelving unit is now priced at $89, down from $109.\nA check on Ikea\u2019s website shows that some items are listed with the tag \u201cwe lower prices where we can\u201d in red, along with their previous price.\nMr Jansen said that Ikea\u2019s 2022 Life At Home report revealed that 74 per cent of the 1,000 Singaporeans surveyed worry about their household finances.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we work hard to keep prices as low as possible on essential and best-selling items, so these savings count for the many Singaporeans looking to get the most for their home,\u201d he added.\nThe survey was carried out by global public opinion and data company YouGov and collated responses from 37,405 respondents in 37 countries.\n\u201cThe Ikea vision is to create a better everyday life for many people by offering a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them,\u201d said Mr Jansen.\n\u201cWe stand by our promise to be the most affordable, accessible and sustainable home furnishing retailer in the country.\u201d\nDespite slashing the prices of its furniture, Ikea said the wholesale price projections do not touch on the prices of food products and its restaurants\u2019 food. Still, some customers welcome the price reduction in Ikea\u2019s home furnishing and storage products.\nMr Desmond Wang, who is in his 30s, said he was \u201csuper happy\u201d when he found that he could fit more items into his budget when he went to Ikea about two weeks ago to purchase some furniture for his home. He had originally planned to make two visits, so he could set aside more to spend.\nAnother customer, Ms Susanna DeCruz, was also pleasantly surprised when she noticed that some of the furniture items she was interested in were cheaper than before. She told ST that she purchased the items immediately, despite visiting the Ikea outlet at Alexandra last weekend just for \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d at first."}
