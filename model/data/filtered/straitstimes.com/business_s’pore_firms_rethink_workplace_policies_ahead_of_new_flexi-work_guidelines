Flexi-time arrangements entail employees working flexibly at different timings with no changes to total work hours and workload, while those on flexi-load arrangements generally take up different work loads, with pay adjusted to match.\nAll employers here must fairly consider formal staff requests for flexible work arrangements from Dec 1, 2024.\nMs Doreen Tan, head of Asia at cloud-based data storage company Dropbox, said the firm has operated on a \u201cVirtual First\u201d model since October 2020, where remote work is the default for all employees.\nShe added that a recent internal survey found that 82 per cent of employees cited high levels of effectiveness, while 78 per cent agreed that they were productive using the company\u2019s remote work model.\n\u201cWe will be eagerly following the roll-out of the changes in Singapore, as there may be takeaways we could consider for our own model,\u201d Ms Tan said.\nMs Jacinta Low, head of talent and performance management and sustainability at OCBC, said flexi-place, flexi-time and flexi-load work arrangements have been available to the bank\u2019s employees since before the pandemic.\nShe noted that supervisors are encouraged to conduct regular check-ins and introduce feedback mechanisms to address any challenges that may arise after employees take up their preferred work arrangement.\nWhile flexible work arrangements may boost productivity for large companies, smaller firms such as start-ups have noted that a balance has to be struck between maintaining employee satisfaction and ensuring that workers can still fulfil their job responsibilities.\nMs Fernn Lim, chief operating officer of fintech start-up audax, said the firm ensures its employees do not exploit flexible work arrangements by clearly outlining its expectations to them so that they can remain on track with their responsibilities.\nRegular check-ins between managers and employees are also conducted to monitor progress, provide feedback and check on staff well-being, she added, noting that all employees are expected to remain contactable during work hours.\nMs Lim said no changes will be made to the firm\u2019s flexi-place and flexi-time arrangements once the new guidelines kick in, but it will need to evaluate which roles qualify for flexi-load arrangements, which can be more complicated to set up.\nMr Nima Karimi, founder and chief executive of fellow fintech start-up Lendela, said decisions to accommodate flexible work requests are made on a needs-based basis.\nThe firm takes into account several factors, including personal circumstances, living conditions, tenure, performance and whether an employee\u2019s role is tied to a specific market.\nWhile Mr Karimi acknowledged that flexible work arrangements can be beneficial, he also pointed out that there is a need for start-up employees to work together and \u201cfight the fight\u201d every day, as firms like his face more challenges than mature or larger companies.\n\u201cThis involves helping each other succeed and carrying one another when someone falls behind. We also need to create a culture from scratch, which is much harder to do over a screen,\u201d he said.\nBoth small and larger companies in Singapore agree that apart from increased productivity, flexible work arrangements may also help cut costs while attracting and retaining talent.\nMr Karimi said the new guidelines will help the company structure its workplace policies and enable it to gain a deeper understanding of what prospective employees might be looking out for in an employer.\nHe added that although flexible work arrangements might not be feasible for the company yet, given the customer-facing nature of some of its work teams, there is a clear financial advantage to having smaller office spaces.\naudax\u2019s Ms Lim said flexible work arrangements can help to enhance morale, job satisfaction, and hence talent retention among existing employees, which contributes to a positive workplace culture.\n\u201cThis is also a trend that we are seeing from interviewing candidates as part of a modern workforce approach,\u201d she added.\nMs Sumita Tandon, Asia-Pacific human resources director at LinkedIn, said flexible working is no longer seen as a rarity but is becoming the norm, and is one of the most important factors influencing a professional\u2019s decision to work for a company.\nShe added: \u201cBy offering workplace flexibility and subsequently a healthier work-life balance, companies are more likely to both attract and retain their talent, leading to better results for the company in the long run.\u201d"}
