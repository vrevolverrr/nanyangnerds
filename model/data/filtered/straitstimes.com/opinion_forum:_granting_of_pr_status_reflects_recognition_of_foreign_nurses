According to Singapore Nursing Board\u2019s 2019 report, about 18 per cent of the nursing workforce is Filipino.\nThis surge in recruitment is a testament to the nation\u2019s commitment to fortifying its healthcare system to meet the escalating demands, particularly in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe article quoted Health Minister Ong Ye Kung as saying more foreign nurses were granted permanent resident status in 2023, in recognition of the essential role they played in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and supporting Singapore\u2019s growing healthcare needs.\nThis acknowledgement of their unwavering dedication during the pandemic underscores the vital role played by nurses, who form the biggest group of professionals within Singapore\u2019s healthcare system.\nBeyond the immediate impact on the workforce, this move signals a broader understanding of the importance of diversity and inclusivity in healthcare.\nThe granting of permanent resident status to those who have performed well and are committed to Singapore is a game changer.\nBeyond the monetary benefits, this status offers nurses a sense of stability and permanence, giving them a more profound connection to their community. It elevates their professional standing and contributes to the overall resilience and adaptability of the healthcare system."}
