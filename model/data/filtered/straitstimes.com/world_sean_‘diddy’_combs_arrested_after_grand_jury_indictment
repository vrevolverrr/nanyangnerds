Combs denies the allegations.\nIn September, Combs was ordered to pay US$100 million (S$130 million) in a different sexual assault lawsuit to Mr Derrick Lee Smith, who accused the artiste of drugging and sexually assaulting him at a party almost 30 years ago. An attorney for Combs said the rapper would move to have the judgment dismissed.\nR&B vocalist Casandra Ventura sued Combs in 2023, accusing him of serial physical abuse, sexual slavery and rape during a 10-year professional and romantic relationship. She agreed to an undisclosed settlement in November 2023, and Combs strongly denied the allegations. REUTERS"}
