Previously, she updated parents on their child's progress through a book. The centre now uses an app to engage parents and provide pictures and updates during the day.\n\"We take on many different roles as childhood educators, and one of the more important ones is communicating with parents. They want the best for their child and they are interested in knowing what they learn in school,\" she said.\nECDA is also working with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council to promote programmes that support the well-being of educators and enhance work safety.\nTo date, more than 5,500 pre-school staff from almost 90 pre-schools have participated in HPB's workplace health programmes, which include physical activities and workshops covering topics like nutrition and mental wellness.\nWSH Council will also be organising workshops in November, where pre-school operators will be trained on how to identify and manage safety and health risks.\nWith the Covid-19 situation stabilising, the wearing of masks has become optional in most indoor settings from Monday.\nEarly educator Sarah Rivera, 39, said that while taking off her mask will need some getting used to, she knows it is good for the children to be able to interact and learn without that restriction."}
