The Vatican formalised and explained its policy on blessings for same-sex couples in a major document from its doctrinal office on Dec. 18.\nBefore the synod began last October, Burke was the star guest of a gathering of conservative in a theatre near the Vatican, where he called for a defence against the \"the poison of confusion, error and division\" in the Church.\nBurke was also one of four cardinals who publicly challenged the pope on doctrinal issues regarding the family in 2016.
