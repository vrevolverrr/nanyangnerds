Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation were US$64 million, roughly in line with estimates.\nGrab, the largest of South-east Asia\u2019s ride-hailing and delivery companies, is trying to prove that its brutal cost-cutting drive is yielding results. The Singapore-based company is focused on profits after years of spending to grow its market share and fend off competition.\nYet Indonesia\u2019s GoTo Group is proving a tough rival, keeping prices low and margins thin for both companies as they battle it out in the South-east Asian market of 675 million people.\n\u201cTo us, it wasn\u2019t a miss,\u201d Grab chief financial officer Peter Oey said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re driving more users to the platform. We\u2019re also launching more new products.\u201d\nShares of Grab, which had been one of the region\u2019s hottest start-ups, are down 69 per cent since it went public through a US blank-cheque company in late 2021. Still, they have stabilised in 2024 as its losses narrowed, outperforming its main regional rivals.\nGrab, backed by Uber Technologies, is seeing growth slow from triple-digit rates in years past as customers in the region curb spending to cope with elevated inflation and interest rates. Demand is increasing at a slower pace as Grab\u2019s customer base expands and consumers are less willing to hail a ride or get food delivered to their door in a challenging macroeconomic climate.\nProfitability on net income basis, which it has not set a concrete timeline for, will be the next big target in Grab\u2019s effort to prove to investors it can make money.\n\u201cFor the fiscal year 2024 we\u2019ll have a positive free cash flow, and that\u2019ll be an important milestone for us,\u201d Mr Oey said. \u201cThe next milestone for us is to get a positive net income.\u201d\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Nathan Naidu said: \u201cGrab\u2019s investments, such as its tie-up with online travel agent Trip.com, should allow Grab to continue to make gains with travellers amid a comeback in tourism in South-east Asia, particularly tourists from China who are seizing upon visa-free travel.\n\u201cThe boost to its fintech sales from loan-book expansion amid a further ramp-up of its Malaysian digital bank should allow it to counter normalising sales in its food delivery segment and drive group revenue.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
