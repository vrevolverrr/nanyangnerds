US Secret Service agents opened fire, and he fled before surrendering without a struggle.\nOn Sept 15, Routh appeared in court, where he was informed he was being charged with illegal firearms possession. He appeared calm and did not speak, other than to say \u201cyes\u201d to questions from the judge.\nMore charges are expected at a later date, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probing what it said \u201cappears to be an attempted assassination\u201d.\nAccording to an FBI criminal complaint, Routh seems to have spent nearly 12 hours on the perimeter of the Trump golf course, based on cell phone records.\nOn July 13, Trump was grazed by a bullet in an attack at a Pennsylvania rally, which also saw a supporter in the crowd killed before the lone gunman was shot dead by return fire.\nTrump \u2013 who was not hurt in the Sept 15 event \u2013 told Fox News Digital that rhetoric from Mr Biden and Ms Harris \u201cis causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country\u201d.\nThe 78-year-old referred to frequent comments that he poses a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d.\nMr Biden and Ms Harris have described the former president as a danger over his refusal to concede defeat to Mr Biden in 2020 and his campaign to classify the mob of his supporters who stormed Congress in 2021 as political dissidents.\nTrump \u2013 whose main election message against Ms Harris is built on dark warnings about immigrant \u201cinvasion\u201d and claims that the United States is a \u201cfailing nation\u201d that only he can save \u2013 said his opponents \u201cuse highly inflammatory language\u201d.\n\u201cI can use it too \u2013 far better than they can \u2013 but I don\u2019t,\u201d he added.\nIn a later post on his Truth Social network, Trump said \u201cthe bullets are flying, and it will only get worse\u201d, before launching into an attack on immigrants.\nAs a major party candidate and former president, Trump has a sizeable security detail but smaller than that of a sitting president. This meant that on Sept 15, the bodyguards could not cordon off the entire golf course, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said, explaining how the accused was able to get to within a few hundred metres of Trump before being intercepted.\nThe would-be attacker has a lengthy criminal record, according to US media, and was obsessed with the Ukrainian cause. He travelled to Ukraine, claiming he wanted to volunteer and was recruiting foreign fighters to help repel Russia\u2019s invasion.\nHowever, there is no evidence that Routh ever fought there or was able to join the Ukrainian military. His social media presence indicates a wide variety of political affiliations at home.\nCondemning \u201cany form of political violence\u201d, United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed relief on Sept 16 \u201cthat the former president is safe and that law enforcement acted quickly\u201d.\nFear of wider violence\nThe intensity of threats is rising as the US presidential race enters its final weeks, and polls continue to indicate a tight finish on Nov 5.\nThe latest twist follows days of tension in the Ohio town of Springfield as a result of conspiracy theories stoked by Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance about the local Haitian immigrant community.\nSchools and other public institutions have been repeatedly shut down there since Sept 12 after receiving threats.\nThere are also broader worries that Trump will again refuse to concede if he loses to Ms Harris, stoking a repeat of the violence on Jan 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed Congress to try to stop certification of Mr Biden\u2019s victory two months earlier.\nTrump used the Sept 15 incident to appeal for campaign funds, posting on social media a day later: \u201cFIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!!!!!\u201d and \u201cDonate Today!\u201d AFP"}
