It was also to have included a visit to Papua New Guinea.\n\u201cThe Quad leaders meeting will not be going ahead in Sydney next week. We, though, will be having that discussion between Quad leaders in Japan,\u201d Mr Albanese told a news conference.\nA bilateral programme in Sydney with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could still go ahead next week, he added.\nMr Albanese did not comment on whether Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida would still visit Sydney next week.\nThe Quad is an informal group that promotes an open Indo-Pacific. Beijing sees it as an attempt to push back against its growing influence in the region.\nAsia Society Policy Institute senior fellow Richard Maude said the cancellation of Mr Biden\u2019s visit to Papua New Guinea, which would have been the first by an American president to an independent Pacific islands nation, could set back Washington\u2019s battle for influence with Beijing in the region.\n\u201cThe mantra in the region is all about turning up. Turning up is half the battle. China turns up all the time, and so the optics aren\u2019t great,\u201d Mr Maude, a former Australian intelligence chief, told a panel discussion on the Quad on Wednesday.\nIndia and Australia are not part of the G7 group of seven rich nations \u2013 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US \u2013 but have been invited to attend the summit in Japan."}
