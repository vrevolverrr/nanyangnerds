Your soldiers, your citizens, particularly in the northeast in Kharkiv, are suffering tremendously,\u201d he said on stage, holding a red electric guitar.\n\u201cBut they need to know, you need to know, the United States is with you... They\u2019re fighting not just for a free Ukraine, but for the free world,\u201d he added."}
