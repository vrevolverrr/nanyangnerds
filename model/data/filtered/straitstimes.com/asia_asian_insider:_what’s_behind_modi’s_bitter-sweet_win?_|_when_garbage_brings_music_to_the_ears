Our correspondents not only reported on the discussions covering tensions in the South China Sea and wars in Ukraine and Gaza, they also offered their views from the gallery of Asia\u2019s leading security forum.\nElsewhere, the construction of Indonesia\u2019s new capital Nusantara hit some speed bumps this week when the project\u2019s leaders abruptly resigned. President Joko Widodo flew to the site in Kalimantan the day after, in an apparent attempt to soothe concerns, report our correspondents Hariz Baharudin and Linda Yulisman.\nWe also have a collection of music-related stories for you this week, from Indonesia\u2019s heavy metal hijabis set to rock Glastonbury and K-pop fans backing green causes, to Taiwanese artistes under pressure for making pro-China statements."}
