Kyiv and its allies say it is an unprovoked imperialistic attempt at a land grab, which has since killed thousands and displaced millions of Ukrainians, turning cities into rubble.\nMaj-Gen Lukyanovich told CTV that Belarus was also expecting more military aircraft deliveries from Moscow in 2024 and that Minsk was putting its efforts into strengthening its anti-drone systems.\n\u201cThe fact that drones are the plague of the 21st century is obvious,\u201d Maj-Gen Lukyanovich said. \u201cThis is a headache, which, I think, we will find the means to counter.\u201d REUTERS"}
