The exercise ended on Monday,\nChina announced the three days of drills last Saturday, after Taiwan\u2019s President Tsai Ing-wen returned to Taipei following a meeting in Los Angeles with US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\nChina claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Beijing\u2019s control.\nThe US Navy said the operation by its destroyer was consistent with international law.\n\u201cAt the conclusion of the operation, USS Milius exited the excessive claim area and continued operations in the South China Sea,\u201d a US Navy statement said. \u201cThis freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea.\u201d\nIn March, China and the United States sparred over the movements of the USS Milius, which China said entered its territorial waters in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands.\nChina claims vast swathes of the area that overlap with exclusive economic zones of various countries, including the Philippines. Trade worth trillions of dollars flows every year through the waterway.\nMeanwhile, a top Japanese government spokesman said on Monday that Tokyo has been following China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan consistently and \u201cwith great interest\u201d.\nJapan has long worried about China\u2019s military activities in the area, given how close its southern islands are to Taiwan.\n\u201cThe importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is not only important for the security of Japan, but also for the stability of the international community as a whole,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters.\nThe southern Japanese island of Okinawa hosts a major US air force base, and last August, when China staged war games to protest the visit of then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei, Chinese missiles landed within Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone.\nThe US has said it is also watching China\u2019s drills closely.\nThe Chinese military conducted simulated precision strikes against Taiwan on Sunday.\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s Eastern Theatre Command on Monday released a short video on its WeChat account showing a nuclear-capable H-6 bomber flying in what it said was the skies to the north of Taiwan.\n\u201cThe missiles are in good condition,\u201d an unidentified voice says, as the video shows images from the cockpit.\n\u201cStart the fire control radar, lock on the target,\u201d another voice says, showing images of a missile under the aircraft\u2019s wing.\nIt then shows a pilot readying the fire control button for what it describes as a simulated attack, and then pressing the button, though it did not show any missiles being fired.\nTaiwan\u2019s military has been scrambling fighters and sending warships to shadow China\u2019s forces, but said it would respond calmly and not provoke conflict.\nOn Monday morning, Taiwan\u2019s Defence Ministry released a map of Chinese air force activities over the previous 24 hours, showing fighters again crossing the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait and four carrier-based Chinese J-15 fighters operating over the Pacific Ocean to Taiwan\u2019s east.\nWhile the ministry did not provide details, Taiwan said last week it was tracking the Chinese carrier Shandong to its east.\nThe ministry separately released pictures on Monday of mobile launchers for the Taiwan-made Hsiung Feng anti-ship missiles at an undisclosed location, and missile-armed fast attack boats at sea.
