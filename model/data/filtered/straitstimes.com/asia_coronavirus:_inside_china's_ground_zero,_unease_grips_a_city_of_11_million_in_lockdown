I'll try to stay home as much as I can.\"\nWith the death toll from the virus rising markedly last weekend, and more cases identified, life in Wuhan has gone from normal to fraught in a matter of days. Within hours of the travel restrictions being announced, hundreds of cars queued in barely moving traffic at a toll booth for a highway out of the city.\nHome to a bustling port on the Yangtze River, Wuhan is a transport hub for central China, with a number of high-speed rail lines converging there. A former British settlement, it still retains architecture from that period, with steel and car manufacturing among the main employers.\nMs Yi said that when she left home on Monday morning, about 20 per cent of people wore protective face masks; by evening, she estimated the number had soared to about 80 per cent.\nFor Wuhan native Guo Zirui, that means an unusual separation. One of the 21-year-old student's parents works at a local hospital so he says his family decided to send him back to his dormitory in Beijing, where he is studying at Tsinghua University.\n\"The hospital is not a hotel so medical staff have to go back home after work,\" he said, speaking by mobile phone from Wuhan railway station on his way back to the capital on Wednesday afternoon. \"The situation is still unclear and we don't know if it's safe for me to keep staying in Wuhan.\"\nThe Chinese New Year holiday - when hundreds of millions of people are set to travel in the biggest annual migration of humans on the planet - is providing a significant challenge for Chinese authorities striving to contain the outbreak that has also infected people from Thailand to the United States.\nOn Wednesday, China announced a stepping up of controls at transport points across the country and increased screening of travellers. But officials admitted there is much they don't know about the new virus, which belongs to the same family of bugs as Sars, a respiratory outbreak that killed about 800 people 17 years ago."}
