No injuries were reported.\nA spokesman for the Singapore Land Group, which initially said the object was a fire extinguisher, said it conducted an inspection with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Wednesday.\nThe canister was part of an FM200 fire extinguishing system which the tenant had engaged a contractor to dismantle. Such systems are not typically found in normal office environments, but are commonly used for server rooms.\nIn the event of a fire, the system discharges a gas that is stored in a liquefied and highly compressed form in canisters.\nTenants at The Gateway have been issued a circular from the management about the incident.\nSCDF said they were not called in to the incident on Tuesday.\nBut an inspection team was sent following the report by The Straits Times.\nThe iconic Gateway is a 37-storey skyscraper complex designed by architect I.M. Pei, who most famously designed the Louvre Pyramid in Paris.\nIt was completed in 1990 and is known for its trapezoidal shape that gives the illusion of being two-dimensional when viewed from certain angles."}
