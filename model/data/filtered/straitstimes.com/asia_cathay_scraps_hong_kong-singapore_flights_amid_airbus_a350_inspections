The only flight still due to depart as at the mid-morning of Sept 3 was an afternoon connection on a Boeing 777.\nMeanwhile, nearly half of Cathay\u2019s services on Sept 3 from Hong Kong to Bangkok and those to Tokyo\u2019s Narita airport have also been axed. Of those still running, none are on an A350 aircraft. Cathay has said some 48 individual flights, including return legs, have been cancelled.\nThe Hong Kong-based airline, among the world\u2019s biggest operators of the long-haul A350, identified the component failure on a plane that was forced to return from a flight originally headed to Zurich on Sept 2. A subsequent check of the fleet revealed several of the same engine parts needed replacing.\nThe Hong Kong-Singapore service is a flagship leg for Cathay, and a key route for regional connectivity, plied daily by hundreds of business people and other travellers. The airline did not specify the fault it had found.\nThe engine is made by Rolls-Royce Holdings, whose shares plunged as much as 8.2 per cent on Sept 2.\nCathay Pacific shares in Hong Kong were down 0.4 per cent.
