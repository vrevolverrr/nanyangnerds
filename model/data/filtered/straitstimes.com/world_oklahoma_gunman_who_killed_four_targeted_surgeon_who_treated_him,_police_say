Two doctors and two other people were killed.\nThe suspect \u201ccame in with the intent to kill Dr. (Preston) Phillips and anyone who came in his way,\u201d Franklin said.\nAuthorities found a letter on the gunman that made it clear that the attack was targeted.\nPhillips, 59, the surgeon who treated Lewis, was killed along with Dr Stephanie Husen, a 48-year-old sports medicine specialist.\nAuthorities named two other fatalities: Amanda Glenn, a receptionist, and William Love, a patient. The receptionist was initially identified as Amanda Green, but police later corrected the name on the department\u2019s Facebook page.\n\u201cThey stood in the way and (the suspect) gunned them down,\u201d Franklin said.\nThe gunman, who police said lived in Muskogee, Oklahoma, about 80km from Tulsa, had been released from the hospital on May 24 after back surgery, the police chief said.\nAfterwards, the man called several times complaining of pain, Franklin said.\nThe shooting comes on the heels of two other mass killings that have stunned Americans and reopened a long-standing debate over tightening controls on firearms ownership and the role of mental health in the epidemic of gun violence plaguing the United States.\n\u201cEnough is enough. This must stop. Hospitals are pillars of our communities,\u201d Chip Kahn, chief executive of the Federation of American Hospitals, said in a statement.\nThe gunman purchased the rifle he brought to the hospital at a local gun shop earlier on Wednesday, authorities said. He also bought a pistol at a pawn shop three days earlier.\nThe suspect parked on the second floor of the garage attached to the Natalie building, a five-story medical office building with numerous offices, rooms and hallways. He entered through the second-floor entryway and worked his way into the building, Franklin said.\nPolice arrived at the scene three minutes after receiving a call at 4.53pm CDT (4.53am on Thursday, Singapore time) of a shooting at the hospital.\nOfficers raced into the building and followed the sound of gunfire up to the second floor, and made contact with the victims and the suspect five minutes later, the chief said.\nOfficers at the scene said they heard a gunshot five minutes later, which Franklin said was the gunman taking his own life.\n\u201cWhen we get that call, we are going to disregard any safety measures that we might have for ourselves and we are going to go in the building to deal with the threat. Our philosophy is that we will stop the threat and we will do that by any means necessary,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we train.\u201d"}
