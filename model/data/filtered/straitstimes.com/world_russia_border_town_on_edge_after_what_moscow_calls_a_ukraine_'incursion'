The bandits might come, break down the door and kill me,\u201d Mrs Ulyanova added. \u201cEveryone is waiting for something and is afraid of something.\u201d\nKlimovo, which is home to around 13,500 people, is located not far from the villages of Lyubechane and Sushany, the scene of the reported attacks.\nMr Oleg Poshlov, a 38-year-old librarian, compared the town in the southern region of Bryansk to a \u201ctinderbox\u201d but expressed support for the authorities. \u201cWe will never give up our country,\u201d he added.\nOn Thursday, Moscow reported that a group of \u201cUkrainian nationalists\u201d had crossed into the region of Bryansk, killed two civilians and wounded an 11-year-old child.\nPresident Putin denounced the \u201cterror attack\u201d, but a different account was put forward in two videos on social media showing four men in military uniform claiming to be from a Russian volunteer group in the Ukrainian army.\nThe FSB domestic security service said the attackers had later been pushed back over the border and targeted with a \u201cmassive artillery strike\u201d.\nBut locals said they had questions.\nMs Elena Romanenko, 47, said the reported cross-border incident was concerning.\n\u201cThis was very unexpected,\u201d said Ms Romanenko, who works as a packer at a grocery store.\nShe said she thought the Russian military had been \u201cbetter trained and our borders had been better protected\u201d.\n\u2018Always tense\u2019\nRussia claims its border regions, including Bryansk and Kursk, have been routinely shelled by Ukrainian forces since the start of Moscow\u2019s assault, but the alleged incursion would be a rare instance of fighting inside its territory.\nMs Romanenko said that despite everything she had faith in Russia\u2019s air defence and that the town had seen \u201cmany fewer\u201d hits recently.\n\u201cWe believe that our boys will protect us,\u201d she said.\nMany locals were afraid to speak to reporters.\nSome said they felt abandoned and said authorities needed to beef up security. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand why there is no military in the city,\u201d said a 66-year-old woman.\nAnother woman said she had packed an emergency suitcase and always carried identity papers in case she and her family had to \u201crun\u201d.\n\u201cWe are always tense,\u201d said the 47-year-old woman.\nEven local authorities admitted they were concerned but insisted that life was returning to normal.\n\u201cOf course, the situation is a bit worrying,\u201d Mr Nikolai Samusev, head of the nearby village of Novyi Ropsk, told AFP.\n\u201cWe did not expect this to happen.\u201d AFP"}
