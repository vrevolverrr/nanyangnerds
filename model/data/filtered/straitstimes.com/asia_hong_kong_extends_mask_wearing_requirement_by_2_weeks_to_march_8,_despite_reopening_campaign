The city dropped most of its other curbs earlier in the year.\nThe extension drags mask wearing into March, when the city will host a number of global events, such as the World City Championship golf tournament and the Museum Summit 2023, making it the busiest month in more than three years.\nTo lure tourists, the city is giving away more than half a million airline tickets as part of its Hello Hong Kong campaign.\nFinance chief Paul Chan on Wednesday said the government would soon launch a Happy Hong Kong campaign to boost the economy. This would include gourmet experiences and activities to create \u201cfun amusements and an exciting ambience\u201d, he said in his annual budget address.\nHong Kong\u2019s economy shrank in three of the last four years, while the population fell by 187,300, or 2.5 per cent, to 7.33 million from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022 as residents left for other cities.\nThe city closed its borders after the pandemic struck and imposed extreme social distancing rules. Yet it still had a wave of deaths caused by the Covid-19 Omicron variant.\nIn another sign that the city has yet to leave the pandemic era, the Education Bureau said on Tuesday that pupils in kindergartens, primary and special needs schools will need to continue to do daily Covid-19 tests at least until March 15.\nThe requirement will be dropped for secondary school students from March 1.
