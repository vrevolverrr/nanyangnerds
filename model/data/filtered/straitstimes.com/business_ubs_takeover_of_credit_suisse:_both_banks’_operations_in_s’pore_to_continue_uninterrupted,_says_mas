MAS will work with relevant stakeholders to proactively address any impact on employment,\u201d it said.\nJointly, the two banks have some 120,000 staff worldwide, and their combined headcount in Singapore is estimated to be around 7,500.\nUBS had said it would be cutting jobs to reduce costs. Mr Ermotti told Swiss broadcaster SRF on Monday that around 10 per cent of Credit Suisse staff had already left the company before its takeover by his bank.\nUBS also unveiled a slew of leadership changes on Monday, which will see a number of top Credit Suisse executives leaving, while others will take on lesser roles.\nOnly a fifth of the 160 leadership positions in the combined bank are coming from Credit Suisse, according to Bloomberg.\nUBS\u2019 key wealth division will also see several changes, including the hiring of Singaporean Young Jin Yee as co-head of the bank\u2019s global wealth management for the Asia-Pacific. She had worked at Credit Suisse for almost 20 years before joining Deutsche Bank.\nUBS noted that it had been attracting talent, with senior hires understood to be up by 20 per cent to 30 per cent in 2023 since it announced the acquisition.\nMAS said it is in close contact with its Swiss counterpart, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, which said in a statement on Monday that the legal completion of the takeover will bring clarity and stability for the banks, as well as for the banks\u2019 clients."}
