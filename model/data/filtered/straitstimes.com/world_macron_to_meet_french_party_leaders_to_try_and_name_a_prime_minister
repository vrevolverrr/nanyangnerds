But the break is over, and Mr Macron will appoint a prime minister after these talks, which will continue on Aug 26, his office said.\nMr Macron has so far ignored the candidate agreed on by the left-wing\u2019s alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP), which topped the vote, pointing out that, despite being first, they are far from an absolute majority in Parliament.\nInstead, he has called for leaders to strike deals beyond party lines to form a government that would have a solid majority.\n\u201cFaced with this Parliament of minority (parties), there is a need for political leaders to get along with each other,\u201d an official in Mr Macron\u2019s Elysee office said. The election \u201cforces everyone to change tack and enter into a coalition logic\u201d.\nThe NFP wants its candidate, Ms Lucie Castets, a 37-year-old senior civil servant, to be named prime minister.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll remind the president of his obligation to respect the French\u2019s choice,\u201d Ms Castets told a rally in the western France city of Tours late on Aug 22.\n\u201cWe won those elections, whether Emmanuel Macron likes it or not,\u201d Greens leader Marine Tondelier told the same rally.\nCommunist party leader Fabien Roussel, whose party also belongs to the NFP alliance, said on Aug 23 that not appointing Ms Castets would trigger a severe crisis.\nBut Ms Castet\u2019s chances of getting the job are slim.\nA source close to Mr Macron told Reuters earlier in August that the President believes the centre of gravity of the new Parliament is in the centre or the centre-right.\nOther possible candidates include conservative regional president Xavier Bertrand and former Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeveuve, sources said. French media recently mentioned Mr Karim Bouamrane, the Socialist mayor of an impoverished Paris suburb, as another possible name.\nMr Macron has a history of coming up with unexpected prime ministers. The French Constitution says he is free to name who he wants; however they need to be able to survive no-confidence votes from the opposition. REUTERS"}
