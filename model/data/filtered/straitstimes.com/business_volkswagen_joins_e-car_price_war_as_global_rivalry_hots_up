In China, the world\u2019s largest car market, the industry\u2019s electrification has shifted into higher gear and VW is rapidly falling behind domestic competitors.\nChina accounts for some 40 per cent of VW group sales, mostly vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines, giving the brand a market share in China of 16 per cent.\nBut in the electric car segment, VW has eked out a market share of just 2.4 per cent, trailing Tesla at 7.8 per cent and China\u2019s BYD at 16 per cent.\nA slew of other Chinese automakers, such as Wuling, GAC and Chery, are also outperforming VW, according to data compiled by financial daily Handelsblatt.\nFellow German carmakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW are faring no better in China \u2013 their e-models hold a market share of less than 1 per cent each.\nOf the more than five million electric vehicles sold in China in 2022, VW accounted for just 155,700.\nWith VW expecting China to make major strides in autonomous driving in the near future, the German group said in 2022 that it was teaming up with Chinese artificial-intelligence chip specialist Horizon Robotics to accelerate the development of smart-driving technologies.
