The Fed recently slowed its aggressive pace of hikes as it tackles stubborn inflation.\nWithout fresh data, the central bank would be forced to make decisions with serious ramifications for the US economy without having a clear picture of where things stand.\nWhile a short shutdown would have a limited long-term impact, it could become a significant issue if lawmakers fail to reach agreement swiftly.
