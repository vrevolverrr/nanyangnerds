It must be approved by regulators and Spirit\u2019s shareholders to be completed. Boeing will also spin off portions of Spirit to Airbus, its European rival, as part of the transaction.\nBoeing said its acquisition of Spirit is expected to close by the middle of 2025. The purchase represents a strategic reversal for Boeing, which started relying more extensively on independent suppliers in the 2000s to cut costs and raise profits.\nSpirit was created during that outsourcing drive in 2005, when Boeing sold a division in Wichita, Kansas, and operations in Oklahoma.\nBesides its work for Boeing, Spirit makes components for aerospace companies including Airbus, Bombardier, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Rolls-Royce. Boeing accounted for 64 per cent of Spirit\u2019s net revenue in 2023, while Airbus accounted for 19 per cent.\nSpirit\u2019s quality problems led to a leadership shake-up last autumn in which Mr Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and a former senior US Defence Department official, became CEO.\nAt Boeing, Mr Shanahan was regarded as an accomplished executive who could quickly turn around troubled programs or units. He is now a leading candidate to replace Mr Calhoun, who plans to step down by the end of 2024.\nBut Boeing has its own quality problems. The company has faced intense scrutiny since a Jan 5 incident in which a panel on a 737 Max 9 blew out during the Alaska Airlines flight shortly after take-off. The panel, known as a door plug, covers the gap left by an unneeded emergency exit.\nNews of the Spirit agreement came hours after a report that federal officials planned to offer Boeing a plea deal in a fraud case related to a pair of fatal crashes more than five years ago in which 346 people died.\nWhile no serious injuries were reported in the Jan 5 episode, the consequences could have been far more severe had the panel blown out at a higher altitude when passengers may have been moving around the cabin.\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board has said the plane appeared to have left a Boeing factory without the bolts needed to secure the plug, and the company has said it cannot find documentation of that work. The plug had been removed so that workers for Spirit could perform repairs nearby.\nIn response, Boeing has made several changes in recent months. It said it has expanded training, simplified plans and processes and increased inspections at its 737 factory in Renton, Washington, as well as at Spirit.\nSince March, it has also stopped accepting 737 bodies, or fuselages, from Spirit that do not fully meet Boeing\u2019s standards. It had previously tolerated some flaws that could be fixed later, in the interest of keeping production moving.\nBoeing has also said it aims to reduce its practice of performing manufacturing tasks out of sequence, also known as travelled work. Some travelled work is considered necessary, but too much can disrupt the complicated process of making aeroplanes, possibly contributing to defects and poor workmanship. NYTIMES"}
