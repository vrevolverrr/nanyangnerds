Can printing money make you really rich?\" A 30-year-old friend asked: \"I wonder if all this confidence to keep printing money is because the US dollar is still the default reserve currency\", while a reader wrote in to The Straits Times opining that the US economy is \"unsinkable\" only because the country \"can print fiat currency at will and spend as much as it can print\"."}
