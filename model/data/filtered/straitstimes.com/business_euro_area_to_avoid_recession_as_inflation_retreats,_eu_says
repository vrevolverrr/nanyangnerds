That is seen picking up to 1.2 per cent in 2024 and 1.6 per cent in 2025 \u2013 a slightly more optimistic view than that of the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\u201cStrong price pressures and the monetary tightening needed to contain them, as well as weak global demand, have taken their toll on households and businesses,\u201d EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead to 2024, we expect a modest uptick in growth as inflation eases further and the labour market remains resilient.\u201d\nPrice growth will average 5.6 per cent in 2023 and ease to 3.2 per cent in 2024 and 2.2 per cent in 2025. That is similar to the ECB\u2019s prediction and an upward revision for 2024 compared with the EU\u2019s September forecast, prompted by higher energy and food commodity costs.\n\u201cStill, price pressures related to non-energy consumption categories are expected to unwind, broadly in line with the previous forecast and in a context of slightly tighter financing conditions, moderating wage growth and normalising profit shares,\u201d the commission said.\nInflation eased to 2.9 per cent in October, down from a peak of more than 10 per cent, but ECB policymakers have warned against complacency as price growth may pick up again in coming months. They kept interest rates on hold in October, saying the current level will help return inflation to the 2 per cent goal \u2013 if held for long enough.\nHigh living costs and the ECB\u2019s unprecedented tightening campaign that started in mid-2022 \u201ctook a heavier toll than previously expected\u201d, the commission said.\nSpeaking on Wednesday to Bloomberg TV, ECB governing council member Mario Centeno acknowledged worries over the lack of momentum in the euro-area economy.\n\u201cThe numbers have not been great, zero, 0.1, minus 0.1 quarter on quarter for five quarters in a row creates a little bit of anxiety over will this be a soft landing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis stagnation of the euro area is of course a source of concern for all.\u201d\nEU officials also warned of stalling efforts to bring down public debt in some of the bloc\u2019s biggest economies. Italy\u2019s is seen increasing back above 140 per cent of output in the next two years, with an uptick in 2025 also seen in France after a slight dip in the preceding year.\nInitially helped by inflation, debt reduction is set to become tougher as price growth slows, borrowing costs rise and growth remains subdued, the commission said.\nThe euro area\u2019s sovereign debt has become an increasing source of unease after governments borrowed heavily during the Covid-19 pandemic and the energy crisis, while borrowing costs jumped to combat inflation.\nThe labour market has been a bright spot so far, with unemployment barely increasing even as the economy struggled.\nWhile some member states have meanwhile seen an uptick, jobless rates \u201care expected to remain broadly stable\u201d, the commission said.\nThe continued war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East mean uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, it added. How China fares and the transmission of monetary tightening within the euro area also pose risks.\nThe report covered Ukraine itself for the first time after the country gained EU candidate status. The commission predicts 3.7 per cent growth next year and 6.1 per cent in 2025 \u2013 after a 29 per cent slump in 2022. BLOOMBERG"}
