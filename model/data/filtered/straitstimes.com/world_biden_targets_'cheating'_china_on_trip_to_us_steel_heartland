They\u2019re cheating and we\u2019ve seen the damage here in America.\u201d\nMr Biden won the coveted backing in March of the union, and has opposed a bid by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel to take over the Pittsburgh-based firm US Steel in a further attempt to woo the union.\nHe repeated his vow on April 17 to torpedo the Japanese takeover of the \u201ciconic American company\u201d.\n\u201cAmerican-owned, American-operated by American union steelworkers, the best in the world \u2013 and that\u2019s going to happen, I promise,\u201d he said.\nBeijing reacted furiously after Washington said it was also launching a probe into Chinese shipbuilding following a complaint by unions, including United Steelworkers.\nMr Biden insisted, however, that he was not seeking a showdown with China.\n\u201cNo trade war,\u201d Mr Biden earlier said, when asked by reporters about the Chinese tariffs during a stop at a coffee shop in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania.\nOn the first day of the trip on April 15, he stopped by his childhood home in Scranton while taking aim at Trump as an elitist billionaire, as the tycoon languished in a New York courtroom as part of his hush money trial.\nThe Biden administration views China\u2019s practices as a barrier to that.\nChina accounts for about half of global steel production, while exporting the metal at a significantly lower cost than US steel prices, a senior US official told reporters.\nThe US Trade Representative said separately it was launching its probe into China\u2019s trade practices in the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors.\nBeijing said it firmly opposes the probe, with China\u2019s commerce industry calling it \u201cfull of false accusations, misinterpreting normal trade and investment activities as harming US national security and corporate interests, and blaming China for its own industrial problems.\u201d\nThe trade tensions come against a backdrop of wider stresses between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\nThe US has identified China as its key rival for the coming century, but Mr Biden has also sought to manage tensions.\nHe met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California in 2023 and they spoke recently.\nBut China was again angered when Mr Biden hosted the leaders of Japan and the Philippines last week in a concerted front against China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region.
