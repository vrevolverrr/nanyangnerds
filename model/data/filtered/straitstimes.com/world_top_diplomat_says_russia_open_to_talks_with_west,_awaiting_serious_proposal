If there is a proposal, then we will consider it,\" He said.\nCommenting on the possibility that Turkey could host talks between Russia and the West, Mr Lavrov said Moscow would be willing to listen to any suggestions but could not say in advance whether this would lead to results.\nHe said Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan would have an opportunity to put proposals to Mr Putin when both visit Kazakhstan this week."}
