It\u2019s a gesture of support for (the) local church and a gesture of support for local countries and to learn from (them),\u201d added Bishop Tighe.\nThe secretary of the Section for Culture at the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Culture and Education was speaking to The Straits Times on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in Dalian, China, on June 25.\nIn Jakarta, Pope Francis is due to have an interfaith meeting at the Istiqlal Mosque and meet the president of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country. More than 3 per cent of Indonesia\u2019s nearly 280 million people are Catholic.\n\u201cHe\u2019s also interested in the future of the Church. Sometimes (when) we think of the church and our model of the church, we think of a Western model,\u201d Bishop Tighe said.\nBut Christianity has been thriving in smaller communities in Asia and \u201cit is a modelling of a certain way of being Christian (that) is also attentive to other cultures\u201d, he added.\nThe pontiff\u2019s trip will be his first abroad since a two-day visit to Marseille in France in September 2023, and will be the longest that he has ever been away from Rome in his 11-year papacy. Pope Francis turns 88 in December 2024.\nHis fragile health has forced him to skip several engagements, including a trip to the UN Climate Change Conference COP28 in Dubai in November 2023. He has sometimes been seen publicly in recent years on a wheelchair or using a cane.\n\u201cIt is an ambitious trip for a man of his age. But it is symbolically important for him,\u201d Bishop Tighe said.\n\u201cThe Pope often has a sense that many people come to Rome to see him,\u201d he added. \u201cBut he likes to show respect for their cultures and tradition by also visiting and seeing different parts of the world.\u201d\nPope Francis will be in Indonesia from Sept 3 to 6, Papua New Guinea from Sept 6 to 9, and Timor-Leste from Sept 9 to 11.\nHis Singapore trip from Sept 11 to 13 is scheduled to include visits to St Theresa\u2019s Home and Catholic Junior College.\nPope Francis has visited several countries in Asia in previous years. These include South Korea in 2014, followed by Sri Lanka and the Philippines in 2015.\nTwo years later, he travelled to Myanmar and Bangladesh, and in 2019, he went to Thailand and Japan. Kazakhstan figured in his itinerary in 2022, and Mongolia in 2023."}
