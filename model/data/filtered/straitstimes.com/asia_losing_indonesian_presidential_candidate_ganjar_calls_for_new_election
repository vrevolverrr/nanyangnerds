Mr Jokowi\u2019s brother-in-law was chief justice at the time of the ruling.\nThe legal team of Mr Anies also filed a case, calling on March 21 for the court to order an election re-run that excludes Mr Gibran, alleging that his last-minute inclusion unfairly swayed the vote.\nMr Ganjar\u2019s team also complained of a \u201cpoliticisation of social aid\u201d, without elaborating, and have alleged abuse of the Election Commission\u2019s information technology system.\nMr Prabowo swept to victory with the help of young voters and his promise of continuity. Mr Yusril Mahendra, a lawyer for his campaign, said the team has more than 30 lawyers ready to face any legal challenges. REUTERS"}
