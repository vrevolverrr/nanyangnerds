The city shut entertainment venues, suspended dining-in and reduced operating hours for subway and bus services.\nMost of the infections in Anhui were in Si and Lingbi counties, which have been locked down as authorities carry out mass testing.\nWhile close to 30 million people nationwide are under some form of movement restrictions now to quell transmission, authorities have so far steered clear of strict lockdowns in key economic regions.\nThere were 347 local Covid cases reported nationwide for July 11.\nElswhere outside the mainland, the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Macau have shut non-essential businesses, including its 42 casinos, which are the main drivers of the city's economy, and asked residents to stay home except to buy food.\nEconomic, social consequences\nChina's blunt strategy to eliminate the disease wherever it pops up comes with economic and social consequences. It means locking down apartment blocks, neighbourhoods or even whole cities for days or weeks to stamp out even handfuls of cases.\nAnd it has led to a significant slowdown in economic growth, which has been felt globally with the disruption of supply chains.\nMacau's 680,000 residents have been relatively sheltered from the virus. It has reported two deaths and fewer than 2,000 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to government data.\nThe government had already closed parts of the city in recent weeks, along with banks, government buildings, parks and swimming pools. All residents had to undergo rounds of mandatory testing.\nBut until now, Macau had avoided shutting down the casinos, which were last closed in February 2020, for 15 days, because of the economic impact. Shares in the companies that run the casinos tumbled on Monday.\nOn Sunday, a health official in Shanghai said that the first case of an Omicron sub-variant, BA.5.2.1, has been found in the financial hub. The news triggered more mandatory testing orders for residents of several neighbourhoods in the city, which is still recovering from the psychological scars of strict lockdowns earlier in the year."}
