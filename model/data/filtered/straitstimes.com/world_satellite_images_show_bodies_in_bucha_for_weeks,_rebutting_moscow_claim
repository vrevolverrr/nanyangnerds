And according to the Times analysis, Maxar images show dark objects of similar size to human bodies appearing on the street between March 9 and 11.\nMany of the bodies pictured in the satellite images appeared in the precise position on the ground as seen in video footage from the same street filmed by a Ukrainian local council member, and in photographs by international news outlets.\nIn a second side-by-side comparison, the Times studied a video posted on Instagram of a body in the street in front of two cars. A satellite image from March 21 shows the corpse and the vehicles in the same location."}
