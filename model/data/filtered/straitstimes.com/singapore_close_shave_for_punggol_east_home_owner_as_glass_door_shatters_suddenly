Worse, if my boys had been sitting on their high chairs at the dining table, they could have been seriously hurt when the glass fell,\" he told The New Paper on Thursday (March 4).\n\"My wife also does work at the dining table all the time. So I guess you can say it was good timing that this happened when no one was there.\"\nFootage from a closed-circuit television camera shows the door exploding with a loud sound and crashing onto the floor about four seconds after Mr Sito walked into the kitchen.\nMr Sito said before they moved into their new home in May 2018, they decided to put in a sliding door to keep the smell of cooking within the kitchen and the air-conditioning within the living room.\nHe was baffled why the tempered glass door would spontaneously shatter when no one was touching it, and added that it took four people - the couple and two handymen - more than two hours to clear the mess.\nThe impact was so huge that some glass shards were embedded in the vinyl floor.\nMr Sito, who has yet to decide whether to replace the door, said he is discussing it with In2Space Interior, the firm that installed the original door.\n\"All I know is that we won't be getting a tempered glass door ever again,\" he added.\nWhen TNP contacted In2Space Interior, its managing director, Mr Henry Yeo, 54, said he was checking with the door supplier to determine the cause of the sudden explosion.\n\"While such incidents are rare, it does happen. We do advise customers that glass is a breakable material, so they must be careful,\" added Mr Yeo, who offered to replace Mr Sito's door, which is no longer under warranty, at cost price.\nAnother home owner, whose tempered glass partition in her study room suddenly shattered in May last year, said she could not get her contractor to assess the damage as it happened during the circuit breaker period.\nThe housewife who wanted to be known only as Ms R. Lim, 40, and lives with her husband and three children in a terrace house in Serangoon, said she decided to do without a new partition in the end.\nAn industry expert, Mr Victor Sia, 32, who works as a research and development engineer at SG Glass, told TNP that tempered glass often contains impurities such as nickel sulphite, which can cause microfractures in the glass during the heating process.\nTempered glass is known to be four times stronger than untreated glass as it gets strengthened through heat.\nBut after heating, the surface cools down faster than the inner sections of the tempered glass. This can create tension within the glass and lead to high internal compressive stress, which could explain the sudden explosions, he added."}
