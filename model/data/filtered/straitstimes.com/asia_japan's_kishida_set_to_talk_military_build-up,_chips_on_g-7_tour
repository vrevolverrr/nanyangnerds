Talks are expected to range from economic security and semiconductors to the war in Ukraine and rising tensions with nuclear-armed China and North Korea.\n\u201cAs leader of the G-7 chair this year, I\u2019ll be making this visit to reaffirm our thinking on a number of issues,\u201d Mr Kishida told a Sunday news programme. \u201cWith the United States, we\u2019ll discuss deepening our bilateral alliance and how to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d\nHe visits London and Rome after agreeing in December to develop a new jet fighter with those countries. He is to sign a deal with Britain that will establish a legal framework to allow visits by each other\u2019s armed forces, the Yomiuri newspaper reported last Friday.\nAt his final stop at the White House on Friday, issues to be discussed are expected to include Japan\u2019s plans to arm itself with missiles able to strike targets in China or North Korea, the bilateral defence agreement and efforts to limit China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\nTokyo and Washington hope the more muscular military policy that Mr Kishida announced last month, a further move away from Japan\u2019s pacifist post-war Constitution, will close a widening missile gap with China and deter Beijing from military action, particularly against Taiwan.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be going to show the US that this has been concluded \u2013 and, with the G-7 summit approaching, to touch base with the rest of the G-7 to confirm their stances on Ukraine and Asia,\u201d said political commentator Atsuo Ito.\nJapan\u2019s new defensive capabilities may require Washington and Tokyo to revise guidelines that define the roles they play in a decades-old alliance that lets the US keep warships, fighter jets and thousands of troops in Japan.\nLast revised in 2015, the guidelines will likely be among the subjects discussed by Japan\u2019s defence and foreign ministers and their US counterparts on Wednesday before Mr Kishida meets President Joe Biden, a Japanese defence ministry official told a briefing last Friday.\nOn semiconductors, Japan and the US are deepening cooperation on advanced chip development amid growing trade tension with China.\nBoth countries are eager to ensure their manufacturers have access to components considered key to the new technology-driven industries such as data storage, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\nAlthough Mr Kishida has said he backs Mr Biden\u2019s attempt to limit China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors with export restrictions, he has not agreed to match sweeping curbs on exports of chip-manufacturing equipment the US administration imposed in October.\nEven without any major announcements, Mr Kishida will hope his G-7 tour boosts his flagging domestic support, hammered by Cabinet resignations and a scandal over his party\u2019s ties to the controversial Unification Church, analysts said.\n\u201cHolding a successful G-7 summit would bring him maximum political points \u2013 and this trip is preparation for that,\u201d said Prof Airo Hino, a political science professor at Waseda University.
