Earlier, he had said that 9,240 people had been injured. The death toll spiked from 500 reported earlier on Sunday by the Red Crescent.\nMr Sayeeq also said 1,320 houses had been damaged or destroyed.\nTen rescue teams were in the area, which borders Iran, Mr Sayeeq told a press conference.\nMore than 200 dead had been taken to various hospitals, said a Herat health department official who identified himself as Dr Danish, adding that most of them were women and children.\nBodies had been \u201ctaken to several places \u2013 military bases, hospitals\u201d, Dr Danish said.\nBeds were set up outside the main hospital in Herat to receive a flood of victims, photos on social media showed.\nFood, drinking water, medicine, clothes and tents were urgently needed for rescue and relief, Mr Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban political office in Qatar, said in a message to the media.\nAfghanistan\u2019s healthcare system, reliant almost entirely on foreign aid, has faced crippling cuts in the two years since the Taliban took over and much international assistance, which had formed the backbone of the economy, was halted.\nDiplomats and aid officials say concerns over Taliban restrictions on women and competing global humanitarian crises are causing donors to pull back on financial support. The Islamist government has ordered most Afghan female aid staff not to work, although with exemptions in health and education.\nIn August, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was likely to end its financial support for 25 Afghan hospitals because of funding constraints. It was not immediately clear if the Herat hospital was on that list.\nThe quakes triggered panic in Herat, resident Naseema said. \u201cPeople left their houses, we all are on the streets,\u201d she wrote in a text message to Reuters on Saturday, adding that the city was feeling aftershocks.\nThere are a total of 202 public health facilities in Herat province, one of which is the major regional hospital where 500 casualties had been taken, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a report on Sunday.\nA vast majority of the facilities are smaller basic health centres and logistical challenges were hindering operations, particularly in remote areas, the WHO said.\n\u201cWhile search and rescue operations remain ongoing, casualties in these areas have not yet been fully identified,\u201d it said.
