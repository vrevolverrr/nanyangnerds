Fosun Tourism\u2019s stock jumped as much as 9.3 per cent, the steepest gain in more than two months. Fosun International rose 1.3 per cent before paring gains.\nFosun International has stepped up efforts to lower its debt burden, including asset disposal and reduced borrowing. Progress on that front has helped it become one of the few Chinese conglomerates to witness a recovery in global investor confidence in recent years.\nFosun, backed by billionaire Guo Guangchang, owns Club Med through its listed leisure arm Fosun Tourism Group.\nClub Med is known for its all-inclusive resorts offering a range of leisure activities from fine dining and massages to yoga, scuba diving, and baby gym classes. It operates over 60 resorts globally in destinations including the French Alps and the Maldives, according to its website.\nCapitaLand Investment, which was listed in late-2021 as part of a major restructuring at CapitaLand Group, has been facing market pressure over its sizeable investments in China, which is experiencing a major property downturn.\nCapitaLand Group is backed by Singapore\u2019s investment company, Temasek, which also holds a majority stake in the investment arm.\nA representative for CapitaLand Investment and Fosun Tourism declined to comment, while Fosun International did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
