So the stakes are very high,\" Gen Cavoli said.\n\"They're really dependent this year on us, Mr Chairman. And without our support, they will not be able to prevail.\"\nRepublican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson is refusing to call a vote on a Bill that would provide US$60 billion (S$81.2 billion) more for Ukraine. The White House is scrambling to find ways to send assistance to Kyiv, which has been battling Russian forces for more than two years.\nRussian air strikes on Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region on April 10 afternoon hit a clinic and a pharmacy, killing at least three people.\nRussian attacks have long targeted Kharkiv and the surrounding region, but the strikes have grown more intense in recent weeks, hitting civilian and energy infrastructure.\nUS President Joe Biden's administration has voiced concern about the lack of funding for Ukraine. In March, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned that Ukraine's survival was in danger and sought to convince allies that the US was committed to Kyiv.\nOfficials say the lack of funding is already having an impact on the ground in Ukraine, where Russian troops are advancing, and Ukrainian forces must manage limited resources."}
