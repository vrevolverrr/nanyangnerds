The mother, who was in her 80s, was frail and her hair was not combed properly. What struck me was that the son looked as tired as the mother. There was a certain anxiety that surrounded this man, and it was evident to me that he was sincere in searching for answers.\nMadam M had been referred to my surgical clinic for chronic constipation and consideration for endoscopy.
