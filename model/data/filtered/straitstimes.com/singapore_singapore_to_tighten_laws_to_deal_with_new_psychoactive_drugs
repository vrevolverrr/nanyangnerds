She noted that arguments stating the death penalty is a failed deterrent due to the continued trafficking of drugs into Singapore are \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d.\nMrs Teo said there is \u201cincontrovertible evidence\u201d that the death penalty is an effective deterrent against drug trafficking.\n\u201cWhen we interviewed convicted drug traffickers and analysed their operations, it shows clearly that the death penalty has featured in their calculations, and has significantly reduced the amount of drugs trafficked into Singapore.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cSurveys also show that a large majority of people living in our surrounding region agree that the death penalty has a deterrent effect.\u201d\nIn October, British billionaire Richard Branson criticised the use of the death penalty to deter drug trafficking in Singapore in a blog post.\nMrs Teo urged the Home Team to help Singaporeans be more aware of the dangers of drugs, including cannabis, and to help counter the misleading propaganda that recreational use is harmless. \u201cOn our part, the Government will not waver in our tough approach against drug trafficking, including our use of the death penalty,\u201d she said.\nResponding to calls for Singapore to relax laws regulating cannabis, following Thailand\u2019s move to remove it from its list of illegal narcotic drugs, she said while there is some research that shows the potential uses of cannabinoids \u2013 a substance extracted from the cannabis plant \u2013 in managing medical conditions such as seizures and epilepsy, there was no scientific evidence as to the effectiveness of raw cannabis in doing the same.\n\u201cStudies have shown that cannabis consumption is linked to brain damage and serious mental illness,\u201d she noted."}
