Ukraine says capturing the region is a battlefield priority for Moscow.\nThe number of battles reported by Kyiv's military on the Pokrovsk front in the last 24 hours fell to 41 from 58 over the previous day. The area has seen some of the war's heaviest fighting.\nThe region's governor, Vadym Filashkin, said an attack injured three people in the Selydove area of the district surrounding Pokrovsk. Six buildings were damaged, he said.\nOne person was killed in the village of Mykolayivka and two more were injured in the city of Kostyantynivka just to the west of Bakhmut, the devastated city captured by Russia last year after months of heavy fighting.\nTwo more people were killed in the village of Verkhniokamyanka, Filashkin said. Nine residential buildings and eight homes were also damaged in the district, he said.\nRussian forces stepped up their attacks on the Pokrovsk front this week after Ukrainian forces launched a surprise assault on Aug. 6 and said it had advanced 35 km into Russia's Kursk region.
