He had pleaded guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing.\nKhan was mastermind of the gang involved in the botched robbery and the final member to be convicted.\nBeshenivsky, a constable with West Yorkshire Police, died after being shot when trying to stop a gang robbing a travel agent in Bradford, northern England.\nShe was killed aged 38 on the day of her youngest daughter's fourth birthday, becoming the seventh female police officer in Britain to be killed while on duty.\nHer colleague, Teresa Milburn, was shot in the chest and later recovered from her injuries.\nKhan fled to Pakistan after the incident, remaining at large until he was tracked down by Pakistani and British authorities and arrested in 2020. He was brought to Britain in April last year and formally charged with murder, firearms offences and robbery. REUTERS"}
