These include birth defects and structural abnormalities, as well as blood flow to the fetal brain.\nDr Aishworiya Ramkumar, senior consultant at NUH\u2019s Khoo Teck Puat \u2013 National University Children\u2019s Medical Institute, said excessive screen time also has cognitive implications.\nA 2024 NUH study found that children referred for developmental, behavioural or emotional issues had been exposed to more than two hours of screen time a day on average when they were aged two and under, against international guidelines, which advise no screen time for children in this group.\nExcessive screen use among infants and toddlers can lead to attention, language and social skills difficulties as well as aggressive behaviour in later childhood, said paediatricians.\nIs Singapore ready to support the growing numbers?\nCurrently, there are 25 special education schools for students aged seven to 18 in Singapore.\nThree more will be set up by 2032 to meet the growing demand of students with moderate needs who have autism and can access the national curriculum, said the Ministry of Education (MOE). Pathlight School and St Andrew\u2019s Mission School are currently the only government-funded schools serving this group.\nThe upcoming schools are: Pathlight School 2 run by Autism Resource Centre (Singapore) (ARC) in Tampines in 2025; a new school by Methodist Welfare Services in partnership with Anglo-Chinese School, to start operations in 2026 and to relocate to Tengah in 2031; and Pathlight School 3 in Punggol in 2032.\nWhen completed, the upcoming schools will provide about 1,500 primary and 1,050 post-primary school places, MOE said.\nParents told ST that getting an autism diagnosis allowed them to get their children into schools to get the support needed.\nPre-school teachers told consultant Hellen Yong that her daughter could not interact well with other children and was more difficult to handle. For instance, she became so attached to the playground swing that she would refuse to return to class.\nMs Yong, 42, wasted no time in taking her daughter to the doctor, where she was diagnosed with autism at the age of four. The girl, now eight, is a happy Primary 2 pupil at Pathlight School.\nShe was given the option to transfer to a mainstream school, but Ms Yong decided that the support from Pathlight\u2019s teachers and peers there would suit her daughter better.\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful we didn\u2019t delay treatment. Now she\u2019s doing well, and I\u2019m happy seeing her improvement every day,\u201d she said.\nGetting adequate support\nRachel (not her real name) said a polyclinic doctor referred her son to KKH for review after finding that he could not say \u201cmummy\u201d at his two-year-old milestone check. The boy was diagnosed with autism at the age of four.\n\u201cI was in denial. At first, I felt guilty. What have I done wrong that my son is like this? Then it turned to anger, then regret, and the negative feelings went on,\u201d said the 44-year-old housewife who declined to be named.\n\u201cSome parents are stronger, and they accepted their fate earlier. For me, it took quite a while.\u201d\nHer son, now six and still non-verbal, did not attend pre-school as no centre wanted to take him in. Instead, he attended six hours a week of the Early Childhood Development Agency\u2019s Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (Eipic), which supports children with developmental needs in a group setting.\n\u201cFor Level 3 autism, which is considered severe, this is definitely not enough. My son\u2019s improvement is not obvious compared with high-functioning kids,\u201d said Rachel.\nDr Nah Yong Hwee, an educational psychologist who specialises in the detection of autism, noted that Eipic also has to support other children without autism and faces manpower and space constraints. Hence, some children with autism may not get the intensive support needed, with general research recommending at least 10 hours of intervention a week.\nAnother parent, Mr Dylan Lau, 43, said his son showed a deep interest in fans and trains from a young age, and would have meltdowns triggered by loud sounds from the blender, vacuum cleaner and hair clippers.\n\u201cAs he is our firstborn, we thought he was just a bit naughty,\u201d he said.\nIt was only later when one of his son\u2019s taekwondo classmates suggested that his son might have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that Mr Lau took him to KKH.\nThere, the boy was diagnosed with moderate autism, and a doctor promptly wrote a letter for his primary school studies to be deferred and for him to enrol in Eipic.\n\u201cIt was a relief as we finally understood why he was the way he was, and we could now help him improve himself. Getting that diagnosis was a big turning point for us,\u201d said Mr Lau.\nThe Eipic classes improved the boy\u2019s social skills, and he even discovered a talent for music. His parents signed him up for piano classes, which helped him regulate himself better.\nThey also engaged a private child psychologist to help him adapt and interact with his peers.\nMr Lau, a software engineer, took a year off work to take his son to playgrounds every day to practise interacting with others.\nNow 11, the boy is a Primary 4 pupil at Pathlight.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he is \u2018cured\u2019, but he doesn\u2019t wander off as much now,\u201d Mr Lau said. \u201cIt is a regret on our side that we didn\u2019t catch this earlier. We missed out on those precious years of development.\u201d"}
