Alps removes all radioactive elements from contaminated water except the naturally occurring tritium.\n\u201c(But) to be on the safe side, we have suspended the operations of the facilities in accordance with the predefined operational procedures,\u201d it added.\nJapan\u2019s nuclear regulatory authority also said shortly after the quake that no abnormalities were detected at either the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant or its sister plant Fukushima Daini.\nIn August 2023, Tepco began releasing into the Pacific Ocean around 540 Olympic swimming pools\u2019 worth of wastewater that had collected at Fukushima Daiichi since the 2011 accident, one of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disasters.\nThe operation has been endorsed by the United Nations atomic agency.\nBut China and Russia have criticised the release into the Pacific Ocean and banned Japanese seafood imports, saying that Japan is polluting the environment.\nJapan experiences hundreds of earthquakes every year, and the vast majority cause no damage.\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries from the latest jolt, and there was no tsunami warning.
