There were 72 people on the twin-engine aircraft including two infants, four crew and 15 foreign nationals. There were no survivors.\nMr Dipak Prasad Bastola, an aeronautical engineer and a member of the investigating panel, said that due to lack of awareness and lack of standard operating procedures, the pilots had put the condition levers, which control power, in the feathering position, instead of selecting the flap lever. This led the engine to \u201crun idle and not produce thrust\u201d, Mr Bastola told Reuters. \u201cBut due to its momentum, the aircraft flew for up to 49 seconds before hitting the ground.\u201d\nATR is based in France and the plane's engines were manufactured in Canada by Pratt & Whitney Canada.\nIt was Nepal's deadliest air crash since 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A300 crashed into a hillside on its approach to Kathmandu, killing all 167 people on board.\nNearly 350 people have died since 2000 in plane or helicopter crashes in Nepal \u2013 home to eight of the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains, including Everest \u2013 where sudden weather changes can cause hazardous conditions.\nThe European Union has banned Nepali airlines from its airspace since 2013, citing safety concerns.
