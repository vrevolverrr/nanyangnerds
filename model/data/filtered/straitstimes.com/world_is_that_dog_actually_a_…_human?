He\u2019s not a man; he\u2019s a goldendoodle.\nThis video, taken by the dog\u2019s owner Mr Lawrence Skutelsky, is captioned \u201cTrying to find the zipper on my goldendoodle after this\u201d, and it has been viewed on TikTok more than 87 million times.\nPosted on May 24, it joined a pantheon of similar videos from other goldendoodle owners documenting the humanlike behaviour of their pets \u2013 and prompted a host of new additions to the genre.\nBack in 2020, a woman named Molly Dolan, who lives in Charleston, South Carolina, posted a video of her goldendoodle walking upright on two hind legs across the entire street \u2013 and it has been viewed about 6.5 million times to date.\nMr Skutelsky, a 22-year-old New Yorker who works for his family\u2019s flooring business, said he took the video of his 1-year-old goldendoodle, Brady, when he was visiting his parents\u2019 house in the suburbs. It was the first time he\u2019d ever seen Brady sit like that, he said in an interview, but it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d noticed the dog acting like a human.\n\u201cI came home the other day from the office and he was, like, literally laying in my bed, under the covers,\u201d Mr Skutelsky said.\nMs Corrine Gearhart, a 43-year-old professional dog trainer who specialises in doodle breeds, described goldendoodles as \u201cuniquely sensitive\u201d.\n\u201cThey can read us so well and that, in part, comes from the poodle side, which is really sensitive and intelligent,\u201d said Ms Gearhart, whose business, the Doodle Pro, is based in Denver. The golden side is \u201cjust friendliness\u201d, she added.\nShe said she thought these goldendoodle personality traits might make it easier for their owners to anthropomorphise (or attribute human traits to) them, even more so than owners of other breeds do.\nWhen we notice aspects of dogs that remind us of ourselves, she said, \u201cI think that helps us have compassion for them.\u201d\nMany commenters on TikTok say it\u2019s not just the doodles\u2019 body language that reads as human; it\u2019s their eyes. Doodle eyes tend to look similar to ours, with large irises and expressive eyebrows.\n\u201cDoes your dog have normal eyes or does your dog have strangely human eyes that make you think he\u2019s trapped the soul of a human person inside of his body?\u201d asked one TikTok user named Nolan in a sound that went viral. Upon seeing a compilation of doodles with abnormally expressive eyes, another commenter joked, \u201cYep \u2026 I\u2019m getting a cat.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, their eyes are freakishly human for sure,\u201d Mr Skutelsky acknowledged. \u201cWhen I look at him, sometimes, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to say something.\u201d\nAfter training hundreds of goldendoodles, Ms Gearhart said, she has found them to be very expressive with their faces.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the scientific reasons, but I can tell you just anecdotally, they\u2019re more prone to connected eye contact with us when communicating,\u201d she said.\nIn 2019, scientists studied the eyebrow muscles and movements of dogs and compared them with those of wolves. They found that \u201cdomestication transformed the facial muscle anatomy of dogs specifically for facial communication with humans\u201d, perhaps giving them a more recognisably \u201chuman\u201d set of facial expressions.\nTikTok users are a rapt audience for animals (and human babies) displaying the sentience of adult humans. In addition to the influx of goldendoodles acting like people, there was the \u201cfully conscious\u201d baby, a one-year-old named Kate with an enthusiasm for the Four Seasons Orlando who many thought was far beyond her years.\n\u201cEveryone was saying, \u2018Brady\u2019s the Four Seasons Orlando Dog\u2019,\u201d Mr Skutelsky said.\nThough she acknowledged goldendoodles\u2019 humanlike traits, Ms Gearhart said owners and fans of the breed shouldn\u2019t get carried away, as they might risk misinterpreting what their dogs are really trying to tell them.\nFor example, she said, a dog may pull his lips back and show his teeth in what may look like a smile, but such behaviour is more typically an expression of fear or aggression.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to still understand dog body language and not completely apply our human behaviours and expectations to them,\u201d she said."}
