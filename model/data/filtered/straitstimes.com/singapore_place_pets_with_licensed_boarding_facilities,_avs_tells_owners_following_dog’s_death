Vets were also unable to perform resuscitation as rigor mortis had set in on Miso\u2019s carcass by then, the report added.\nRigor mortis is the stiffening of joints and muscles when a human or animal dies, and occurs between two and six hours in dogs after death.\nMs Law, a photographer in her 30s, put up a series of Instagram posts about the matter from Jan 6.\nShe told ST: \u201cHer sudden and premature death at the boarding place is something that we never anticipated in a million years. Her death has left an irreplaceable void in our hearts.\u201d\nMs Law said she was aware that the boarding facility was not licensed when she first used its services in 2021 on the recommendation of a friend, as the business was operating out of a Housing Board flat in Tampines at the time.\nShe said: \u201cHe was taking in only a couple of dogs and we felt more assured as there were people at the home almost round the clock.\u201d\nFollowing its move to a shophouse at the end of 2022, Ms Law said she assumed that the business had been licensed as a pet boarding facility as it now occupied a commercial space.\nShe said: \u201cWe trusted that the owner had taken the proper route (in applying for a licence), and that falls on us for not double-checking it.\u201d\nThe boarding facility declined ST\u2019s request for comment, citing the ongoing investigation.\nAVS said licensing for such services is put in place to safeguard animal welfare, and encouraged pet owners to place their pets in the care of these service providers."}
