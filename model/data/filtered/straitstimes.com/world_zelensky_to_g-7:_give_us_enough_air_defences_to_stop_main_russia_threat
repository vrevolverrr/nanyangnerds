Parks, tourist sites and busy rush-hour streets were also hit.\nKyiv and its allies condemned Monday\u2019s attacks.\nUnited States President Joe Biden and other G-7 leaders convened on Tuesday to discuss what more they could do to support Ukraine.\nMr Zelensky told them air defence systems are his \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d.\nMr Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said on Tuesday that Mr Biden\u2019s promises to supply advanced air defence systems to Ukraine will only extend the conflict and inflict more pain for Ukraine.\nHe added that the deliveries would not change Moscow\u2019s goals in its military operation in Ukraine.\nTuesday\u2019s missile strikes did not seem as intense as on Monday.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the main targets on Tuesday were energy facilities.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve hit many yesterday, and they hit the same and new ones today. These are war crimes planned well in advance and aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians \u2013 Russia\u2019s deliberate strategy since months,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nThe governor of the southern town of Mykolayiv said Russia seemed to have changed tactics.\n\u201cThey launch rockets more than once, so that our people can wait and our air defence can work. But, at intervals, they launch significantly fewer rockets and keep people in shelters. What is this if not terror?\u201d he said on national television.\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine\u2019s sixth-largest city, apartment blocks have been struck overnight at least three times in the past week, killing civilians while they slept.\nIn an overnight video address from the scene of one of the attacks in Kyiv, Mr Zelensky promised that Ukraine would keep fighting.\n\u201cWe will do everything to strengthen our armed forces. We will make the battlefield more painful for the enemy,\u201d he said. REUTERS, NYTIMES"}
