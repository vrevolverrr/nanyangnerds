According to the GMPA, if no action is taken to decarbonise the power sector, the country\u2019s projected greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 could go up to 37.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent a year.\nUsing only domestic measures such as maximising Singapore\u2019s solar potential and developing smaller natural gas power plants, Singapore would be able to mitigate only 3.03 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year. The average mitigation cost of doing so would be around US$50 (S$66) per tonne of CO2 equivalent.\nBased on its modelling, the GMPA projects that domestic measures alone will be insufficient for Singapore\u2019s power sectors and hard-to-decarbonise industries to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nHowever, if Singapore were to collaborate with its neighbours, its net-zero ambitions could be met through green electricity imports such as green ammonia and solar, along with the help of battery and ammonia storage technologies.\nThe atlas shows how collaborations with different combinations of countries could also yield varying results.\nFor instance, if Singapore and Indonesia were to collaborate, an additional 61 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent can be mitigated a year at US$20 per tonne of CO2 equivalent beyond the current baseline cost.\nSingapore could invest in a solar farm in Indonesia for electricity imports, which would benefit both countries in cutting their greenhouse gas emissions.\nThis mitigation potential could be increased by a further 19 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year if there were a three-way collaboration between Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. This could have a total additional mitigation potential of 80 million tonnes of CO2 a year, at the same US$20 per tonne of CO2 equivalent additional cost.\nDr Aniq Ahsan, a scientist at A*Star who was involved in the project, told The Straits Times that the mitigation atlas demonstrates how a multinational Asean grid would help to reduce emissions across different countries, while also reducing the costs of doing so.\n\u201cOur data also shows, for instance, that ammonia storage technologies should only be utilised closer to 2050, as such tech is still extremely costly, and it would be more economically viable to leverage them later.\n\u201cIn the nearer term, power sector imports would be more economically viable, even while taking into consideration the costs of building power lines and subsea cables between countries,\u201d he noted.\nDr Michiel Schaeffer, the lead science adviser at Climate Analytics, said that a key objective of the atlas is to channel more finance, capacity building and tech solutions for emissions mitigation in developing countries by fostering international cooperation.\nThe team also hopes to incorporate all greenhouse-gas emitting sectors in South-east Asia to have a more comprehensive overview of the international collaboration needed to get the region to net-zero.\nOther co-benefits of making the green shift, such as less air pollution and improved public health from the use of cleaner energy, could also be incorporated into the atlas to ensure more robust policy decisions.\nEventually, the team hopes to roll out the atlas to other regions, such as East Africa and Southern Africa.\nHopefully, this could allow countries to make \u201cunexpected\u201d partnerships, and decarbonise their economies as quickly as possible, said Dr Ahsan."}
