Odysseus will focus on space weather interactions with the Moon\u2019s surface, radio astronomy, precision landing technologies and navigation.\nIntuitive Machine\u2019s IM-2 mission is scheduled to land at the lunar south pole in 2024, followed by an IM-3 mission later in the year with several small rovers.\nIn January, Japan became the fifth country to place a lander on the moon, with its space agency Jaxa achieving an unusually precise \u201cpinpoint\u201d touchdown of its Slim probe.\nIn 2023, India became the fourth nation to land on the moon, after Russia failed in an attempt the same month.\nThe US, the former Soviet Union and China are the only other countries that have carried out successful soft lunar touchdowns. China scored a world first in 2019 by achieving the first landing on the far side of the moon. REUTERS"}
