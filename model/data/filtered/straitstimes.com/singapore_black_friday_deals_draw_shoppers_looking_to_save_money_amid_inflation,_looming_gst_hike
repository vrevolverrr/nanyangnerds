It cost me $25 for a set of five towels. The quality is pretty good, and I\u2019ll be giving them away to my siblings for Christmas.\u201d\nMadam Lim, who used to work in the service industry, added: \u201cI\u2019m buying the bedsheets for myself. I have a bed in my daughter\u2019s home, so these new ones will be going there.\u201d\nThe Straits Times visited the Metro Paragon outlet, Courts Nojima at The Heeren and Tangs at Tang Plaza on Friday.\nBlack Friday is the day after the United States holiday of Thanksgiving, which is typically celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. It is regarded as the first day of the Christmas shopping season, when retailers make many special offers.\nLured by vouchers, gifts and cash rebates of up to $2,500, around 100 shoppers were spotted queueing outside the Courts flagship store before doors opened at 11am on Friday.\nNear the front of the queue was Mrs Teo Bee Leng, 53, who said she had reached the store around 10.15am with her two sons in tow. She was attracted by a 43-inch HD television set on sale for $299, around half of its original retail price.\n\u201cWhere else can you find such a good deal? I tried looking online during the 11.11 sales, but I don\u2019t remember seeing anything like this,\u201d said the housewife.\nForking out around $14,000 on a mattress, fridge, washer, dryer, dishwasher and speakers for her new home was 34-year-old educator Natalie Quah.\nMrs Quah said: \u201cThe mattress is usually about $8,000, but we paid less than $6,000. On top of the discount, we got quite a few freebies such as pillows, mattress protectors and a big air purifier and other brand vouchers, which I will use for groceries. I think, in total, we saved at least $5,000.\u201d\nShe added that she and her husband had decided to take advantage of the Black Friday sales in order to avoid the upcoming GST hike and because of the store\u2019s policy of allowing the items to be delivered at a later date.\n\u201cEven if there\u2019s a better price online, we can\u2019t take delivery now, and online stores don\u2019t offer gifts or extended warranties,\u201d said Mrs Quah. \u201cWe also have more assurance about where our product was manufactured by buying in-store.\u201d\nOver at the Tangs department store, shoppers crowded the basement level, which stocks cookware and kitchen appliances.\nIT professional Ernest Neo, 42, who was browsing for cast iron cookware, said he was attracted by the heavy discounts on some of the items on sale.\n\u201cI enjoy cooking but, even then, I normally would not think of buying one of these pots... because they are too expensive. But I might consider getting one now because it\u2019s around $300 cheaper,\u201d he said.\nResponding to queries from The Straits Times, Mr Erwin Wuysang-Oei, head of marketing and e-commerce at Metro, said: \u201cAs a retailer, we are fully aware of macroeconomic uncertainties surrounding the global outlook, with inflation, rising electricity prices and uncertainty as a result of the prolonged war in Ukraine.\n\u201cAnd on the domestic front, we are faced with high inflation and an upcoming increase next year in GST.\u201d\nA spokesman for Courts Nojima said the store has focused on providing promotions on products such as home appliances, IT equipment and furniture, which it believes consumers will gravitate towards in the light of the upcoming GST increase."}
