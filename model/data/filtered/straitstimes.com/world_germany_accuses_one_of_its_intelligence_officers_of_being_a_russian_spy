And earlier this week, Austrian investigators arrested a Greek resident of Vienna on suspicion of espionage for Russia.\nThe arrest in Germany may prove unusual, however, in that the accused mole was found inside the country\u2019s own intelligence agency, raising the risk that contacts and informants within Russia may have been betrayed.\nFederal prosecutors said, in a statement, they searched the suspect\u2019s home and workplace.\nMr Kahl, the BND president, described Russia as an actor \u201cwhose unscrupulousness and willingness to use violence we have to reckon with\u201d.\nA number of other Russian spies, who were not undercover agents but officially worked for intelligence services, have been rounded up and expelled in recent years, possibly making Russia more reliant on sleeper agents, especially as the Kremlin\u2019s war effort in Ukraine has faltered.\nSecurity analysts in Europe say the arrests have also made Moscow push more aggressively for intelligence from its remaining sources.\nGermany\u2019s last case of a double agent was in 2014, when a member of the intelligence services was put in prison for eight years for espionage, mostly for passing information to the CIA, and for offering himself to Russian secret services.
