Operating profit for budget carrier Scoot came in at $24 million, up $76 million compared with the prior year.\nEarnings per share for the first quarter stood at 14.3 cents, up from 5.8 cents a year ago.\nGroup passenger capacity expanded 32.4 per cent year on year as restrictions on international air travel eased globally.\nSIA and Scoot carried 8.4 million passengers during the quarter, 65.5 per cent higher than the year before.\nPassenger traffic and load factors improved across all markets, with year-on-year traffic growth of 49 per cent outpacing the capacity expansion.\nAs demand for air freight continued to soften, cargo loads fell 11.3 per cent year on year, while capacity grew 12.1 per cent, primarily from the increase in belly-hold capacity as more passenger flights returned to service.\nExpenditure for the airline increased 10.5 per cent to $3.7 billion. The 27.3 per cent rise in non-fuel expenditure was partly offset by a 17.3 per cent decline in net fuel cost, which came in at $1.1 billion. The fall in net fuel cost was due to a 33.4 per cent decrease in fuel prices.\nHowever, SIA noted that the increase in non-fuel expenditure was within the 32.4 per cent rise in passenger capacity.\nThe national carrier said that demand for air travel is expected to remain robust for all route regions through the summer peak, with forward passenger bookings closely tracking capacity injection across most markets over the next three months.\nWhile it expects competition to intensify in the coming months as more capacity is injected into international routes, it said that the company is well positioned in this operating environment.\nHowever, cargo demand is expected to remain soft in the near term due to inflation and weak economic conditions. Higher competition, as well as softer cargo demand, may continue to exert downward pressure on cargo yields, particularly on key trade lanes, it added.\nSIA also said that its fuel hedging contracts at lower Brent crude oil prices before the Covid-19 pandemic have matured as at the end of the first quarter.\nThe remaining hedge positions from the second quarter onwards are at prices closer to prevailing market levels.\nIt also said that macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as inflation, could pose challenges for the airline industry. But it said that it is in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to navigate these challenges and benefit from future opportunities, due to the strength of the group\u2019s portfolio and multi-hub strategies."}
