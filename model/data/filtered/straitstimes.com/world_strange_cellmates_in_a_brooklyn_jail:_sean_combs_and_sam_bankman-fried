They said that Bankman-Fried, a vegan, was subsisting on a diet of water, bread and peanut butter.\nBankman-Fried, who founded the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, was convicted of masterminding a sweeping fraud in which he siphoned billions of dollars of his customers\u2019 money into venture capital investments, political contributions and other lavish spending. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.\nBut after his conviction, Bankman-Fried asked to remain at MDC while he pursued an appeal. He has overlapped in the unit with other high-profile inmates, including an ex-president of Honduras and Mexico\u2019s former secretary of public security.\nCombs\u2019 lawyers initially argued that the conditions at MDC were too \u201chorrific\u201d for a defendant awaiting trial. The jail, a hulking concrete structure with about 1,200 inmates, has long had a history of complaints.\nA lawyer for a detainee who died there in July from injuries sustained in a fight called the prison \u201can overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth\u201d. In 2019, an electrical fire left some prisoners without heat in the dead of winter.\nBut on Sept 24, a lawyer for Combs, Mr Marc Agnifilo, who declined to comment on his client\u2019s roommates, spoke much more positively about the detention centre, saying the \u201cdedicated professionals at the MDC are doing everything possible to help him and his lawyers prepare his defence, and I personally thank them\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019s strong, focused and our meetings are very productive,\u201d Mr Agnifilo said in a statement. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough good things about the MDC, which has been responsive to our and his needs.\u201d\nCombs\u2019 defence is pushing for a speedy trial, and Mr Agnifilo said his team was arranging for him to be able to assess the discovery provided by the government while incarcerated \u201cas soon as humanly possible\u201d. The government has said the case involved a \u201cmassive amount\u201d of evidence, including many witnesses, photos, videos and text messages.\n\u201cMy view is if the government wants to arrest him and hold him in jail, despite a massive bail package and despite his repeated offers to turn himself in, we are all going to have to move this along with unprecedented urgency,\u201d Mr Agnifilo said.\nIn a letter to the judge overseeing the case, Combs\u2019 lawyers wrote on Sept 23 that they did not, at that point, intend to ask for Combs to be moved to a different detention center.\nThe Bureau of Prisons has said that in recent months it has made an effort to improve conditions there, including hiring more permanent staff and addressing more than 700 backlogged maintenance requests.
