It began the pilot phase of a scheme that will tax carbon-intensive goods imported from outside the bloc. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) focuses on imports that have a significant carbon footprint from their production.\nThe EU is doing this because many industries, from steel- and cement-making to power generation and fertiliser production, are big polluters, whose emissions are driving climate change."}
