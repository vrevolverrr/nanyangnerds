So long as these numbers remain small, the healthcare system will have no problems coping - and these patients will also be given the best care possible, as the system is not overwhelmed.\nThe number of daily infections averages 3,100 - again, a manageable number since the Omicron variant in play today is not as virulent as its predecessors and most people have mild symptoms.\nRemoving all restrictions could well have been on the cards.\nBut that is not the way Singapore operates.\nThis step-by-step move towards normalcy has been the trademark of the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic here (MTF), so no one should be surprised that Singapore has not declared a Freedom Day.\nIn fact, segments of the population would have been alarmed had all restrictions been lifted. After more than two years of precautions, with a few setbacks along the way when first the Delta, then the Omicron variants swept across the globe, such concern is understandable.\nIn July last year, people here had looked forward to having most measures eased once 50 per cent of the population had been vaccinated.\nBut outbreaks at KTV lounges and the Jurong Fishery Port put paid to that when they caused a surge in cases, involving many seniors who were at higher risk of serious illness.\nHope again reared its head when 80 per cent of the population had been vaccinated by the end of August. But moves towards living with Covid-19 was again derailed when infection numbers topped 5,000 a day in October, with deaths hitting a new high with 18 dying on Oct 20.\nIn December, the world braced itself for the onslaught of the Omicron variant which had spread from Africa to Europe, and also to Singapore. What was known then was that it spreads much faster than the Delta variant - in many cases, needing only one day between exposure and symptoms.\nObviously, that was the wrong time to ease measures.\nHowever, with 93 per cent of the population now inoculated, and the vast majority of higher-risk seniors having received their booster shots, Singapore is in a much stronger position today.\nOn top of that, Omicron has proven to cause a much milder disease in most, with 99.7 per cent having no or mild symptoms. Only three in 10,000 people infected need intensive care.\nBut given Singapore's chequered history with Covid-19, it was not surprising that even as limits on gatherings were lifted, TraceTogether done away with, and cross-border as well as international travel restrictions further eased, the MTF warned that things could change so, please, don't throw away your TraceTogether token.\nHopefully, the painful lessons learnt over the past two years will instil greater social responsibility so people who are sick will continue to stay home or put on their masks when going out, so as not to spread the illness to others.\nIt should not matter whether they have Covid-19 or the common cold. That would be the responsible thing to do.\nThe healthcare system has also been strengthened over the past two years as hospitals struggled to balance the needs of Covid-19 patients and their usual load of patients needing medical care.\nThey have become more nimble, and many more healthcare workers have been trained to look after patients requiring intensive care. Nurses and doctors were trained and rotated from their normal jobs to take on such stressful roles to give their colleagues much needed breaks. Such rotations should continue to keep skills current against future needs.\nMeanwhile, a few more weeks of caution might not be a bad thing.\nIt will give people who are at higher risk of serious illness - people aged 80 years and above, or who have significant underlying illness - time to get a second booster shot, and for that shot to become effective. So far, about 30 per cent of this group has done so.\nThere is also that 1 per cent of the population who have received only their first vaccine dose. This will give them time to get their second dose and the two weeks for it to become effective.\nFor the rest of us who are fully vaccinated and are longing for the day when masks are no longer necessary indoors, well, it should not be too long a wait. Touch wood."}
