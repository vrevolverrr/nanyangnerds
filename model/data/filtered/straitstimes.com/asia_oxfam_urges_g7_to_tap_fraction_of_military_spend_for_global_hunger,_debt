It said that just 3 per cent of G7 military spending could help solve the global food and debt crisis.\nThe G7 \u2013 comprising the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain \u2013 is set to meet in Italy this week where leaders will discuss issues such as climate change, migration and heavy debt loads in developing countries.\nOxfam said eradicating global hunger would require US$31.7 billion (S$42.9 billion) annually and that the G7\u2019s share of debt relief for the poorest countries would land at a further US$4 billion. It said that these together accounted for just 2.9 per cent of the estimated US$1.2 trillion spent by the G7 on the military in 2023.\n\u201cGovernments are finding their pockets run deep to fund war today, but when it comes to stopping starvation, they are suddenly broke,\u201d Oxfam International inequality policy chief Max Lawson said in a statement.\nSome 167 million people worldwide are suffering crisis-level hunger or worse, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a worldwide benchmark for world hunger, which has warned that lack of funds is preventing it from meeting growing demands and will force it to reduce the scope of its work.\nOxfam called on the G7 to halt arms exports that may be used in war crimes, boost taxes for billionaires, provide debt relief to poor countries to free up budgets for development, and fulfil outstanding aid and climate pledges.\nIt calculated that the seven countries owed some US$15 trillion to states in the so-called Global South in outstanding aid commitments and unfulfilled pledges for climate financing, including the \u201closs and damage\u201d fund.\n\u201cFamilies are struggling to get food on the table, our tax systems are making the rich richer, and the solution is glaringly obvious,\u201d Mr Lawson said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a small commitment with the potential for huge impact.\u201d REUTERS"}
