They did not, however, link him to any particular country.\nBut his public comments and activities suggest that he is using his influence and network to propagate favourable views toward China that have veered into the political realm.\nAccording to the International Organisation for Migration, a United Nations agency, there are an estimated 60 million people of Chinese origin overseas. As China seeks to expand its global influence and secure its interests amid increasing pushback from the United States and other countries, co-opting the Chinese diaspora has gained urgency.\nIn recent years, its diplomats, state media and citizens have been encouraged to \u201ctell the China story well\u201d as Beijing wrestles for control over discourse it said is dominated by western liberal nations.\nIts flagging economy has also added pressure to the need for greater foreign investment.\nA patriotic education law passed in Oct 2023 requires the state to strengthen communication with overseas Chinese, \u201cenhancing overseas Chinese feelings of patriotism and carrying forward the patriotic tradition\u201d.\nSince 2018, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office under the Chinese government has also been integrated into the United Front Work Department under the Communist Party of China, according it greater strategic importance.\nVeteran diplomat Ong Keng Yong, who is also executive deputy chairman of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the ease of doing business and operating among foreign corporations and organisations via Singapore, has emboldened Chinese companies and entities to use Singapore to reach out to others in the region and beyond.\n\u201cFrom this perspective, efforts have been made to cultivate relevant opinion makers and policy people. The idea is to have a PRC-friendly constituency,\u201d said Mr Ong, using the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China. Mr Ong is Ambassador-at-Large at Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\u201cIn this endeavour, the pool of Chinese expatriates or naturalised Singapore citizens of Chinese origin is important. Initially, cultivation efforts revolved around business and some ancestry ties. This has now become more obvious and those inside this circle have become bolder and outgoing,\u201d he said, adding that Mr Chan is one such individual.\nThe Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (Fica), which is now used against Mr Chan, was passed in 2021 to thwart any foreign actor from manipulating domestic politics.\nProvisions under this law to counteract foreign interference via local proxies, covering politically significant persons, came into force only on Dec 29, 2023. Other provisions to counter hostile information campaigns took effect on July 7, 2022.\nAssistant Professor Dylan Loh, who researches Chinese foreign policy at the Nanyang Technological University, said the timing of Mr Chan\u2019s case could be attributed to how Fica has now provided the tools for the Government to act in this calibrated way.\n\u201cI do think that the attempt to intensify United Front efforts has increased,\u201d said Prof Loh, citing the merger of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, tasked with cultivating ethnic Chinese abroad, with the United Front Work Department, which directs all engagement and influence activities in China and elsewhere.\nBringing the Chinese diaspora into the fold has been a clarion call by President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.\nAt the 20th party congress in 2022, where he gained a historic third term as the Communist Party\u2019s leader, he told cadres that China will \u201cimprove and strengthen our work related to Chinese nationals overseas to give shape to a powerful joint force for advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d.\nA former senior Singapore diplomat said pro-China and anti-America sentiments among Singaporean Chinese, especially those aged 70 and over, have become more pronounced, \u201cespecially since President Xi\u2019s appeal to all ethnic Chinese including those overseas to love and be loyal to China\u201d.\nThese have included even former Members of Parliament, said the retired envoy, who asked not to be named because of political sensitivities.\n\u201cNon-Chinese racial groups in Singapore have begun to react to this brazen display of Chinese chauvinism, albeit mostly private resentment thus far. This will grow out of hand if not contained. Imagine how our Chinese and Indians would react if there is an outbreak of hostilities between China and India?\u201d\nChinese influence in Singapore has been a longstanding issue, with the Republic being the only country outside of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan with a majority ethnic Chinese population. Many social institutions from clan associations to some business advocacy groups have maintained ties with their mainland counterparts.\nAs news about Mr Chan made the headlines on Friday evening, Singapore observers pointed to his participation at last year\u2019s session of top advisory body Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, or CPPCC, as one of the key reasons he had caught the attention of the authorities.\nAnalysts have different views of what it means to be invited to attend these parliamentary meetings, where delegates representing a cross-section of society submit proposals and give suggestions.\nSome say that the Communist Party uses these observers\u2019 attendance to suggest that its policies have their support. Past participants have pointed to networking opportunities with international and Chinese elites.\nThe CPPCC, while not a policymaking organ, remains a key United Front platform to engage prominent individuals outside of the CPC to solicit their feedback on various issues related to China.\nPast and present members, who now number 2,200, have included basketball star Yao Ming and action movie star Jackie Chan. Property tycoon Robert Ng, who runs the Hong Kong arm of Singapore\u2019s Far East Organisation, is also a CPPCC delegate.\nSince 2001, the CPPCC has invited foreign citizens of Chinese origin from around the world to attend as observers, or non-voting delegates. As they are not members of the CPPCC, they cannot file proposals, but are invited to make suggestions.\nThey are usually prominent businessmen, academics and leaders of business, social and cultural groups, including youth associations and chambers of commerce. As a rule, each representative is invited to attend in person only once in their lifetime.\nHome Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, in his wrap-up speech on the Fica Bill in Parliament in October 2021, assured Members of Parliament that the law is not meant to curb freedom of speech and foreign interactions.\n\u201cFica will not stop individuals, businesses and organisations in Singapore from building overseas partnerships, soliciting overseas business, networking with foreigners, sourcing for donations, discussing government policies or political matters that affect their businesses with foreign colleagues or business partners or supporting charities.\n\u201cAs long as these are done in an open and transparent manner and not part of an attempt to manipulate our political discourse or undermine public interest such as security.\u201d\nIt will also not cover Singaporeans expressing their own views, said Mr Shanmugam.\nPolitical scientist Chong Ja Ian said that the \u201cirregular, unconventional, and sometimes clandestine approach that the United Front takes toward lobbying and influencing politics in other jurisdictions allows Beijing to have plausible deniability\u201d.\nFor instance, an Australian senator who defended China over the South China Sea was forced to resign in 2018 after it was discovered that he had accepted donations from a source with ties to the Chinese government.\nBesides Australia, countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US have alleged United Front activities, noted Associate Professor Chong of the National University of Singapore.\n\u201cSometimes Beijing will defend these activities as legitimate and claim that (the) authorities in these places are targeting persons from or related to the PRC. At other times, they keep silent.\u201d\nDespite the greater attention that has been drawn to the United Front and its work worldwide, the activities do not seem to have abated, said Prof Chong.\n\u201cI am doubtful that Singapore will be an exception.\u201d\nNoting that Mr Chan had held grassroots positions, including as a patron of Kampong Chai Chee Citizens\u2019 Consultative Committee, Prof Chong said that \u201cthere should be more discussion of the grassroots activities Chan engaged in and his links with ministers, especially any lobbying activity\u201d.\nReferring to the People\u2019s Action Party, he added: \u201cThe PAP is obviously the most influential political entity in Singapore. That makes it, more than anything else, the most likely target for any influence operation.\u201d\nThe People\u2019s Association said in a statement on Feb 2 that Mr Chan has stepped down from all grassroots appointments.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment by The Sunday Times on Feb 3.\nThis latest incident is unlikely to have an impact on bilateral relations, said Prof Loh. Singapore and China upgraded their ties in 2023, during Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s April meeting with President Xi in Beijing.\nSingapore cannot act on the basis of whether a policy or actions will offend another country, and needs to prioritise its own national security and interests, said Prof Loh."}
