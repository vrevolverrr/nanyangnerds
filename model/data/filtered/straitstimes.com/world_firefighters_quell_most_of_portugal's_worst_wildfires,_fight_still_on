Nine aircraft were backing more than 700 firefighters combating flames near the town of Castro Daire in the district.\nSpain, Italy, France and Morocco have sent water-bombing aircraft.\nData from the European Forest Fire Information Service showed that large-scale blazes had burned an area of more than 105,000 hectares (405 square miles) since Saturday, making this year's total of some 140,000 ha the widest burned area since 2017, when Portugal suffered two devastating waves of wildfires that killed more than 100 people.\nThat was well above the annual average of around 94,000 ha in the 2006-2023 period.\nThe Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service said total carbon emissions from the fires in Portugal hit a September record of 1.9 megatonnes through Sept. 18, nearly double the previous record for that month in 2003, and plumes of smoke were expected to reach western France in the coming days.\nAt least some of the dozens of fires across Portugal have been started by arsonists, motivated by possible commercial interest, spite or criminal negligence, authorities said. Police have arrested at least 14 people since Saturday suspected of starting fires. REUTERS"}
