Both sides, it said, agreed to boost cooperation.\nRussia's Commissioner for Children's Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, said on Monday that she had met Spoljaric and discussed the reunification of Russian families whose children were elsewhere in Europe.\nLvova-Belova and Russian President Vladimir Putin are sought on a warrant by the International Criminal Court in connection with the deportation of Ukrainian children during the war. Russia dismisses the warrants as meaningless and politically motivated.\nRussia and Ukraine regularly accuse each other of failing to comply with international norms of humanitarian law.\nUkraine said on Monday it had asked the United Nations and the ICRC to join humanitarian efforts in the Kursk region, where its forces remain after staging an incursion last month.
