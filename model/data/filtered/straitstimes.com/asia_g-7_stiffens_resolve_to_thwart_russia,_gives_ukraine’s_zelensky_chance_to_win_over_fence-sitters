Hours before the claims from Moscow, Ukraine had rejected a claim by Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin that his Wagner fighters had completed the capture of the city.\nDuring the first day of the summit on Friday, in addition to Mr Biden\u2019s endorsement of F-16 training, the G-7 announced new sanctions on Russia.\nMr Biden is planning to roll out a US$375 million (S$504 million) military aid package for Ukraine in Japan as well, according to a US official. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the package will include artillery, ammunition and Himars rocket launchers.\nMr Zelensky has pushed the countries to go further on both economic and military measures.\n\u2018Shouldn\u2019t be naive\u2019 over China\nMr Biden is set to meet with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Sunday to discuss military interoperability and the economic coercion they face from China, a US official said.\nA day earlier, the G-7 leaders outlined a shared approach towards China, looking to \u201cde-risk, not decouple\u201d economic engagement with a country regarded as the factory of the world.\nThe leaders said cooperation with China was necessary given its role in the international community and heft as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, as well as areas of common interest such as climate and conservation efforts.\nBut they said they would take steps to protect sensitive technology that could threaten national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment.\nMr Macron, citing biodiversity, climate and artificial intelligence, said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be naive. We know where we need to engage with China.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBut we need to preserve interests and have elements of reciprocity and protect value chains. We don\u2019t want an escalation\u2026 but on key elements we have to protect ourselves.\u201d\nGerman Chancellor Scholz told broadcaster ZDF on Sunday that the US, Germany and other rich nations would make sure their big investments into China continue, as would supply chains and exports to China, but the G-7 was sending a clear sign it was looking to pare back risk.\nIn a statement, the G-7 reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, where Chinese military exercises have raised concerns over the security of Taiwan, the democratic, self-governed island that China regards as part of its territory.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a complaint to Japan, the G-7 host, expressing firm opposition to the G-7 joint statement, saying it disregarded China\u2019s concerns, had attacked it and interfered in its internal affairs, including Taiwan.
