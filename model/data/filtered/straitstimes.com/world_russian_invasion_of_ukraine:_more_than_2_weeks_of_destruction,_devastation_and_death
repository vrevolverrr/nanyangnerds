He also claimed it was aimed at \"bringing to justice those who committed numerous bloody crimes against civilians\" in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.\nDays later, Ms Nietsche, a 28-year-old translator, found herself crossing into Przemysl in Poland, lost and jaded, according to The Economist, with nothing more than some documents, a sleeping bag and a few pieces of clothing.\nShe was among some 2.5 million people who have fled Ukraine since the onset of the Russian invasion. Six in 10 of them are now in neighbouring Poland to the west. Others went elsewhere including to Hungary, Moldova and Romania.\nThe United Nations said on Friday (March 11) that another two million Ukrainians were displaced in their own country and that 564 civilians had been killed in the war so far.\nThe situation is dire in many areas as Russia pummels Ukrainian cities from the air, land and sea.\nEncircled by Russian forces, people in the southern port city of Mariupol are trapped. They have no electricity and mobile phone networks have been disconnected.\nFood, water and medical stocks are depleting after 11 days of the Russian siege. Reports say fights have broken out over food and people have resorted to melting snow for drinking water.\nMs Elena Coventry, 48, who lives in Scotland, lost touch two weeks ago with her mother and brother who live in Mariupol. She believes they are hiding in the cellar of their home.\n\"Although they are told to always have food supplies, these will have run out by now,\" Ms Coventry told the BBC, adding that it was unbearable for her to not know if they were alive or dead.\nShe joined an Internet forum and recognised her mother's house from one of the pictures of the neighbourhood uploaded there.\n\"The windows are gone, it looks like a human with its eyes gouged out. People had their lives in those flats, they ate, they drank, but now it's horror,\" said Ms Coventry.\nAmid the desperation and chaos, there was a heartwarming story of 11-year-old Hassan Al-Khalaf who travelled on his own by train and on foot for over 1,000km from Zaporizhzhie in south-east Ukraine to seek refuge in Slovakia, where his older brother studies.\nThe boy arrived in Slovakia early this month with just a plastic bag, a passport and a phone number written on his hand.\nHis widowed mother had sent him off alone on the long trip as she had to look after her own disabled mother who could not flee.\nThe Slovakian authorities, who took care of the boy, managed to contact his relatives in the capital, Bratislava. They relied on the phone number scribbled on his hand.\n\"I want to say a big thank you to the volunteers, because they are helping people they don't even know,\" the boy said in an interview on Friday."}
