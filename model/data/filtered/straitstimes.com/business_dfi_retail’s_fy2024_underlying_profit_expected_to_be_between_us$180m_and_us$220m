Sales were supported by good performance in Macau, South China and Singapore.\nHowever, like-for-like sales in 7-Eleven convenience stores in Hong Kong were \u201cadversely affected\u201d by reduced cigarette demand, said the group.\nThe group\u2019s health and beauty division, which includes pharmacies like Guardian, reported \u201chigh-single-digit\u201d like-for-like sales growth in Q1 while home furnishings reported \u201csignificantly lower\u201d underlying profit due to a challenging macroeconomic environment."}
