The findings reinforced what previous studies have long suggested \u2013 that cold, arid, lifeless Mars was once warm, wet and perhaps habitable.\nScientists look forward to an up-close examination of Jerezo\u2019s sediments \u2013 thought to have formed some three billion years ago \u2013 in samples collected by Perseverance for future transport to Earth.\nIn the meantime, the latest study is welcome validation that scientists undertook their geo-biological Mars endeavour at the right place on the planet after all.\nRemote analysis of early core samples drilled by Perseverance at four sites close to where it landed in February 2021 surprised researchers by revealing rock that was volcanic in nature, rather than sedimentary as had been expected.\nThe two studies are not contradictory. Even the volcanic rocks bore signs of alteration through exposure to water, and scientists who published those findings in August 2022 reasoned then that sedimentary deposits may have eroded away.\nIndeed, the radar readings reported on Jan 26 found signs of erosion before and after the formation of sedimentary layers identified at the crater\u2019s western edge, evidence of a complex geological history there, Professor Paige said.\n\u201cThere were volcanic rocks that we landed on,\u201d Prof Paige said. \u201cThe real news here is that now we\u2019ve driven onto the delta and now, we\u2019re seeing evidence of these lake sediments... one of the main reasons we came to this location. So that\u2019s a happy story in that respect.\u201d REUTERS"}
