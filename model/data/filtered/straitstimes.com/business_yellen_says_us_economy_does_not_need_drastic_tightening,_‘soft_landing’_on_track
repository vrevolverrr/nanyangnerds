I think that is what we\u2019re in the middle of.\u201d\nShe said that \u201cinflation has now come way down\u201d, with high prices for some goods, such as eggs, returning to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u201cAnd now wage gains are really translating into more real income. So my hope is that Americans gradually will see that things are getting better,\u201d Dr Yellen said. REUTERS"}
