Charlotte Arnould had revealed that she was the woman behind the accusation, saying that she could not bear to remain silent any longer. Since then, more than 10 women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence.\nDepardieu, through his lawyer, has previously \"firmly rejected\" the accusations.\nIn an Oct. 2 letter published in French daily Le Figaro, Depardieu denied all blame.\n\"Never, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,\" he wrote.\nDepardieu has starred in scores of French-language movies, rising to prominence in 1974 with \"Going Places\", and gaining international recognition with a starring role in the 1990 English-language comedy \"Green Card\". He won a Golden Globe best actor award for that role.\nHis performance in the French-language \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" that same year won him the award for best male performance at the Cannes film festival, and a nomination in the best leading actor category at the 1990 Academy Awards.
