ST has contacted Don Don Donki for more information.\nSFA told ST on July 17 that it is looking into the matter.\nThe agency said that while it puts in place and enforces regulatory measures, food operators must also adhere to good food hygiene and preparation practices and ensure that its premises are clean and well maintained.\nAnyone who comes across potentially errant food operators should report it via SFA\u2019s online feedback form, the agency said."}
