Everything falls apart.\u201d\nHe then accused the WP leadership of wanting to \u201ckill tripartism\u201d, warning that a more adversarial relationship with unions would take its place.\nDr Koh also argued that Mr Giam\u2019s calls for independent, non-partisan unions imply that the WP will not align itself with any unions or develop relationships with unions, and suggested that Mr Giam and the party were \u201ccompletely ignorant\u201d of the fact that the WP started as a party of unionists.\n\u201cSomehow along the way, they lost the trust and the relationship with the unions. So now, Mr Gerald Giam says, like a bit of a toxic ex-boyfriend, because I can\u2019t have a relationship with unions, no one else should have (it) as well,\u201d said Dr Koh.\nResponding, Mr Giam said it is important for unions to work with the government of the day, but they should maintain their independence and not be subordinated to the government.\nHe cited the International Labour Organisation\u2019s (ILO) Convention Number 87, which gives workers and employers the right to organise without interference from the public authorities.\nSenior Minister of State in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Desmond Tan, who is also deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), then rose to ask Mr Giam if he had any personal experience or anecdotes that suggested unions or union leaders faced restrictions due to the symbiotic relationship.\nMr Tan said he had received feedback from union leaders that Mr Giam\u2019s earlier comments on Sept 9 did not represent their experience on the ground. The WP MP had said that an overly close relationship between the PAP and unions risks creating groupthink, where union leaders are less inclined to challenge prevailing policies.\nIn response, Mr Giam said his concerns were about the institutional constraints on unionists. He then asked Mr Tan to cite recent instances where NTUC had taken a public position contrary to government policy.\nTo this, Mr Tan said NTUC has, over the years, been pushing policies the Government has not always accepted. He gave the example of the upcoming SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which he said took 14 years of lobbying before it was finally given the nod.\nAt this point, Dr Koh interjected, noting that Singapore, like the US and New Zealand, has not ratified ILO Convention Number 87.\nThis is because the Republic requires unions to be registered, to guard against \u201cyellow unions\u201d that act on behalf of employers to the detriment of workers and ensure union officers have not been convicted of criminal breach of trust, he said.\nDr Koh and Mr Giam traded words on the WP\u2019s history with unions and its approach towards them, before Mr Singh stepped in.\nThe WP chief said his party rejected Dr Koh\u2019s comments \u201centirely\u201d, adding that the PAP MP had disregarded the fact that the political situation in Singapore has changed dramatically since the WP\u2019s founding in 1957.\n\u201cI would be grateful if the Senior Minister of State can raise a single example where an NTUC secretary-general or a deputy secretary-general has spoken out against a 3G or 4G leader to defend the rights of workers.\n\u201cNow, I am not suggesting that this is the gold standard or the test... But this comes to the heart of what people see and believe to be a conflict of interest,\u201d Mr Singh added.\nDr Koh replied that the debate on the Bill is a \u201cproof point\u201d of how the relationship between the PAP and NTUC has endured for the past 60 years and made the platform workers legislation a possibility today.\nMPs returned to discussing the Bill, before Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) rose to say Mr Giam\u2019s suggestion that the NTUC is subordinate to the PAP\u2019s interests was \u201ccompletely inaccurate\u201d. He added that the WP was trying to score a political point.\nProgress Singapore Party Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai waded in to speak in support of the WP MPs. He said the issue is that the nature of the relationship between NTUC and the Government is \u201cmore than what we have seen in the world today\u201d.\n\u201cIf the NTUC secretary-general is a minister, or a former minister, and there are many leaders in the NTUC that come from the ruling party, I think we are entitled to think that the independence of NTUC ought to be better than this,\u201d Mr Leong added.\nThe exchange was brought to a close by Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, who said he felt compelled to intervene.\n\u201cYou keep talking about independence, independence, independence. Behind closed doors, the tripartite partners do not always agree. Heated discussions happen behind closed doors on many, many issues. The raising of retirement age or even the upcoming workplace fairness legislation. I am sure we will have another very intense debate,\u201d Dr Tan said.\n\u201cThe lack of open confrontation, your so-called being more independent, doesn\u2019t mean that our unions are weak. It shows the power of positive collaboration in delivering results without disruption,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo I hope that you do not judge NTUC or SNEF (Singapore National Employers Federation) by what you think the relationship between unions, employers and the Government should be, but look at the record. Look at the outcomes... that tripartism has delivered for Singapore through the decades,\u201d said Dr Tan."}
