We will provide more support for our youth in generating and implementing their ideas.\"\nSecond, there will be new ways for the youth to get their voices heard. \"We are experimenting with different and novel modes of engagement,\" Ms Fu noted.\n\"Participants can expect the conversations to be more candid and interactive. The conversations should broaden their horizons. This will be a platform where youths meet not just like-minded peers, but also make new friends who may come from different backgrounds, and hold different beliefs and perspectives.\"\nShe added that new methods like hackathons, or mass hacking events, and citizen juries will be used to engage the youth.\nA new online platform is also in the works, said Ms Fu, without giving details.\nThe new national conversation with youth is among new initiatives announced by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) on Thursday.\nThis year, the ministry will be launching Our SG Heritage Plan, a long-term national drive to preserve and promote Singapore's heritage.\nIt will also be expanding the scale of its programmes to encourage racial and religious harmony. The MCCY will use social media to get more people to join dialogues on sensitive topics such as race and religion, Ms Fu said.\nIn the field of sports, the ministry announced that a new sports centre in Sembawang will be completed in the next few years, while older sport centres like those in Delta and Chua Chu Kang will be rejuvenated.\nFour new Active Health Labs will be set up in Sengkang, Woodlands, Bishan and Jurong, while two mobile ones will be deployed at community clubs and residents' centres in Housing Board estates.\nThese labs, run by national sport body Sport Singapore, will help Singaporeans assess their fitness levels and maintain active lifestyles.\nIn a wide-ranging speech in Parliament that covered community, sports, heritage and youth issues, Ms Fu said that her ministry was set up five years ago but its efforts in several areas \"have borne fruits\".\nMore people are taking part in sports, arts and culture activities, she noted, and in volunteerism.\n\"Our volunteerism rate doubled from 18 per cent in 2014 to 35 per cent in 2016, and donations increased by over $200 million from $2.5 billion in 2013 to $2.7 billion in 2015,\" said Ms Fu, citing previously reported figures.\nShe noted that globalisation and other forces are pulling societies apart. Singapore too faces the challenge of strengthening its social fabric in the light of such forces, she noted.\nThe minister added that MCCY will focus on three areas this year: Encouraging Singaporeans to care for one another, promoting greater social cohesion and building a confident nation through arts and heritage programmes.\nThe debate of MCCY's annual budget on Thursday wrapped up a marathon eight days of Parliament sittings. It is the last of the government ministries and organs of state to have its budget scrutinised and approved by the House."}
