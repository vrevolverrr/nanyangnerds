A year later, he was charged with 1,623 offences against 91 children.\nHowever, some charges were dropped and the ABC reported that the Sept 2 charges related to roughly 60 children.\nMany of the victims were under the age of 12.\nThe offences happened between 2003 and 2022 in twelve different locations across Australia, as well as Pisa, Italy.\nGriffith is in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.\nThe court heard that sentencing could take more than two days to give time to read victim impact statements, ABC reported.
