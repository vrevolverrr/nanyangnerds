It said dozens of people were killed in strikes on cars and trucks carrying refugees on Friday, which Reuters could not independently verify.\nIsrael said Hamas is preventing people from leaving to use them as human shields, which Hamas denies.\nIn Gaza City\u2019s Tel Al-Hawa neighbourhood, in the area Israel ordered evacuated, warplanes bombed a residential area during the night, hitting several houses, according to residents who took refuge at the nearby Al Quds hospital and planned to flee south in the morning.\n\u201cWe lived a night of horror. Israel punished us for not wanting to leave our home. Is there brutality worse than this?\u201d a father of three told Reuters by telephone from the hospital, declining to give his name for fear of reprisals.\n\u201cI was never going to leave. I prefer to die and not leave, but I can\u2019t see my wife, children die before my eyes. We are helpless.\u201d\nThe attacks on Israel have plunged the nation into deep grief and galvanised it for war, with hundreds of thousands of reservists mobilised within days.\nFamilies of the kidnapped Israelis are terrified for their safety.\nMr Avichai Brodetz, a farmer from the Kfar Aza kibbutz (communal settlement) whose wife and three children were taken captive to Gaza, set up a camp outside the Israeli army headquarters to focus attention on their plight.\n\u201cThe first thing that needs to happen is the release of the women and children,\u201d he told reporters.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be political. I don\u2019t want to stand here with you. I love my friends and my home and my kibbutz. I hope we can return there, and you\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d\nHamas\u2019 armed wing said nine captives, including four foreigners, were killed overnight due to Israeli air strikes. It previously threatened to kill one hostage for every building Israel strikes without warning.\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Gaza failed to halt Hamas missile strikes deep into Israeli cities.\nAir raid sirens wailed in central Israel on Saturday, and rockets smashed into a greenhouse in Ashkelon and wounded four people at a kibbutz.\nThe Gaza Strip is one of the most crowded areas in the world, and Israel\u2019s evacuation order for the northern half meant those fleeing south were forced to shelter with relatives and friends, in schools or in hastily rented apartments.\nIsrael said the order is a humanitarian gesture to protect residents from harm while it roots out Hamas fighters entrenched in Gaza City.\nThe United Nations said so many people cannot be safely moved inside the besieged enclave without causing a humanitarian disaster.\nHamas has vowed to fight until the last drop of blood, and said the order to leave the north of the enclave is a trick to force residents to give up their homes. Gaza City mosques have blared calls telling people to stay.\nEven wars have rules\nThe Israeli military said on Friday tank-backed troops had mounted raids to hit Palestinian rocket crews and gather information on the location of hostages, the first official account of ground troops in Gaza since the crisis began.\nThe UN estimated that tens of thousands of Palestinians headed south from northern Gaza after the Israeli order on Friday, adding to 400,000 Gazans already displaced earlier in the week.\n\u201cWe need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need,\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday.\n\u201cEven wars have rules.\u201d\nThe United States has firmly backed its ally Israel, but has called on it to protect civilians.\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas\u2019 appalling attacks,\u201d President Joe Biden said on Friday. \u201cAnd they\u2019re suffering as a result as well.\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a lightning tour of the Middle East, met Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister in Riyadh and was due to travel to the United Arab Emirates.
