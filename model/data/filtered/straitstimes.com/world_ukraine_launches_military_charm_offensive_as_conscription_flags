The government has acknowledged its conscription drive has run into difficulties, with thousands of people evading the draft and some seeking to flee abroad rather than risk the trenches.\nA mobilisation law that comes into force next month obliges men to update their draft data with the authorities, although it was stripped of tough punishments for draft evaders after a public outcry.\nReuters is the first news outlet to detail the extent of the defence ministry\u2019s outreach plan, designed to combat public distrust about enlistment and plug a gaping hole in the military by offering recruits a greater sense of control over their fate.\nThirteen of the new recruitment centres have been opened since mid-February and the government plans to expand the number to 30 by the middle of the year, said Mr Oleksiy Bezhevets, a ministry adviser who is currently overseeing the drive.\nAt the first centre, in Lviv, about 300 people visited in the first month, Mr Bezhevets said, without specifying if any signed up. The defence ministry is working with four private recruitment companies to fill military vacancies, he added.\nHe conceded the plans were no \u201cmagic pill\u201d for the military, though he said the range of roles needing to be filled was so broad that it did not matter so much what people chose.\n\u201cThe main goal is to give people the opportunity to conquer their fears and enter into the military sphere,\u201d said Mr Bezhevets.\nHe was among more than half a dozen people involved in the new drive for voluntary recruits who were interviewed for this article, including recruiters and service members.\nMr Michael Kofman, a military specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank, said the recruitment drive was positive for the army but it would not be a decisive solution to a severe shortfall of troops that could only be fully addressed by mobilisation.\n\u201cIt likely needs hundreds of thousands of men to sustain the fight \u2013 in particular, infantry, which few are likely to volunteer for, because it\u2019s the most likely combat arm to suffer casualties,\u201d he added.\nMarines to military intelligence\nUkraine\u2019s conscription effort, launched in the wake of the invasion, has been hampered by local media reports of corruption, official abuse and administrative incompetence. Social media has been flooded with clips of officers corralling men off the street or barging into homes.\nCommon concerns about military service include inadequate training, poor commanders and the fact that there is no cap on the length of service, according to a February poll by Kyiv-based research agency Info Sapiens for media outlet Texty.org.\nIn the survey of 400 army-eligible men, only 35 per cent said they were prepared to serve if called up.\n\u201cSomewhere, at some stage, trust was lost,\u201d said Mr Bezhevets, the defence ministry adviser.\n\u201cRight now, our task is to renew it,\u201d he added.\nUkraine does not release figures on conscripts or voluntary recruits, which it deems sensitive information. President Volodymyr Zelensky nonetheless acknowledged shortcomings in mobilisation when he fired the heads of regional draft offices in August 2023, citing reports of corruption and official abuse.\nMr Bezhevets said the goal of the defence ministry\u2019s recruiting campaign was to triple the number of volunteers who join up.\nIn the longer term, he added, at least a third of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces should be staffed through voluntary recruitment.\nAs part of the hunt, the defence ministry has begun working with four leading job-search sites over the past six months, he said, and around 100,000 applicants had replied to more than 10,000 vacancies advertised.\nLobby X, one of the sites, offers a user-friendly platform that allows jobseekers to search through military branches, from the marines to military intelligence, and categories of jobs, from artillery gunner to cook or press officer.\nLike other job postings, the vacancies list responsibilities, requirements and benefits including monthly pay, which ranges from around US$500 (S$680) to US$3,000. And voluntary contracts can be signed for specific terms starting from three years, or until the end of martial law.\nThe goal, said Lobby X chief executive officer Vladyslav Greziev, is to allow people to choose the exact unit they want to serve with and maximise the use of their skills.\n\u201cGetting good weapons is great, but it\u2019s all used by people,\u201d he said.\nCamouflage business cards\nIn March, Kyiv\u2019s top general said the military would need to mobilise fewer people than the initial target of up to 500,000 more Ukrainians, in part because of volunteers.\n\u201cWe expect that we will have enough people capable of defending their motherland,\u201d Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told the Ukrinform news agency. \u201cI am talking not only about the mobilised but also about volunteer fighters.\u201d\nThe official recruitment push has been matched on the ground by military units reaching out directly to civilians.\nA handful of brigades and smaller units are launching or stepping up their own public relations drives, with more billboards promoting individual units springing up across towns and cities.\nAmong the most prominent is the elite Third Separate Assault Brigade, which has honed its recruiting tactics over the course of a war in which it has excelled on the battlefield.\nThe all-volunteer outfit has become renowned for its sleek social media presence, which includes gripping first-person videos from the front and frequent speaking appearances by larger-than-life fighters with colourful stories to tell.\nReuters accompanied some members on a leg of a multi-region tour of Ukraine in March 2024, aimed at promoting the brigade, educating civilians on military service and recruiting members.\nAt a social services centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskyi, brigade soldiers took turns fielding questions from passers-by and prospective recruits, and offered them spots on a free training course to test their mettle.\nIn two days in Kropyvnytskyi, about 20 people agreed to attend the week-long course, according to one of the soldiers who goes by the call sign \u201cLoft\u201d, a heavily tattooed fighter who carries camouflage business cards with his personal number.\nAt a high school across town, two other burly fighters regaled the teenage crowd with comedy, but also warned of war\u2019s grim realities and emphasised the importance of discipline and preparation.\nOne of them, who introduced himself by his call sign \u201cBull\u201d, said the brigade\u2019s distinct nationalist ideology means its success in attracting recruits may not be easily replicable. But frequent and honest outreach would be key to making military service a desirable path for more Ukrainians as the war drags on, he added.\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing a long game.\u201d\nREUTERS"}
