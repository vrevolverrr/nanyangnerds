I spend all my days worrying about her,\u201d Ms Shaheen said.\n\u201cToday, she was vaccinated against polio to protect her, like all the children in the hospital have been vaccinated.\u201d\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Aug 29 that Israel had agreed to a series of three-day \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d in Gaza to facilitate vaccinations, though officials had earlier said the campaign was expected to start on Sept 1.\n\u2018Not a ceasefire\u2019\nAn international aid worker told AFP that Palestinian authorities had organised a launch event on Aug 31 and that the vaccination campaign was still expected to begin in full on Sept 1.\nCogat, the Israeli Defence Ministry body that oversees civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said on Aug 31 that vaccines would be given daily from 6am until 2pm for three days in central Gaza, three days in southern Gaza, and three days in northern Gaza.\n\u201cAt the end of each regional vaccination campaign, a situational assessment will be conducted for the area,\u201d it said.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry distributed a slightly different schedule, with the vaccine programme lasting four days at each location.\nThe ministry identified 67 vaccination centres \u2013 mostly hospitals, smaller health centres and schools \u2013 in central Gaza, 59 in southern Gaza, and 33 in northern Gaza.\nPoliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water \u2013 an increasingly common problem in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war drags on.\nThe disease mainly affects children under the age of five.

The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.\nIncessant Israeli bombardment has also caused a major humanitarian crisis and devastated the healthcare system. AFP"}
