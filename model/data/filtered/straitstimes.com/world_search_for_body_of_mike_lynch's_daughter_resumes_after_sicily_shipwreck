An interior ministry official said on Aug 22 her body might not be inside the yacht and could have been swept out to sea.\nA judicial investigation has been opened into the sinking, which has baffled naval marine experts, who say a boat like the Bayesian, built by Italian high-end yacht manufacturer Perini, should have withstood the storm.\nThe chief executive of The Italian Sea Group, which owns Perini, told Reuters the shipwreck was the result of a string of \u201cindescribable, unreasonable errors\u201d made by the crew, and ruled out any design or construction failings.\nPulling the wreck out of the sea, where it is now lying on its right side, apparently intact, at a depth of about 50m, may help investigators determine what happened to it, but the operation is likely to be complex and costly.\nMr Nick Sloane, the South African engineer who led the operation to salvage the Costa Concordia cruise liner that sank in 2012, said in Italian media interviews on Aug 23 that the operation would cost up to 15 million euros (S$21.8 million).\nHe told La Repubblica newspaper the yacht\u2019s salvage would have to be completed by mid-October, and take six to eight weeks, including preparation work. Bringing the yacht to the surface will have to be done \u201cvery, very slowly\u201d, and might take a couple of days, he said. REUTERS"}
