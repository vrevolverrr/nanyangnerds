Both of the man\u2019s hands appeared small unlike those of a normal human,\u201d the department said in a Facebook post, adding that there was money in the bag.\nThe officers questioned the man, but he did not answer, leading them to assume that he may be deaf and mute.\nBut they persisted in questioning him, and asked him for his identity card. His response surprised them \u2013 he said he had left the document in his car.\nA further surprise awaited them \u2013 the car turned out to be a Proton X70 premium sport utility vehicle, which retails at between RM123,800 and RM128,800.\nThe unnamed man told the welfare officers that he could get up to RM500 from just four to five hours of begging at night markets.\nThe man, who lives in the neighbouring east coast state of Kelantan, has also been receiving RM450 monthly allowance from the welfare department for his disability since 2001.\nThe welfare officers did not take stern action against the man, letting him go with a verbal warning as \u201cthis is his first offence\u201d in the Maran district."}
