The project will likely be discussed at the Singapore-Malaysia Leaders\u2019 Retreat in October.\n\u201cJohor is Singapore\u2019s gateway to Malaysia,\u201d PM Lee said. \u201cMore than neighbours, Singapore and Johor are partners linked by generations of friendship and kinship.\u201d\nSultan Iskandar also noted in his Facebook post on Tuesday evening that Johor and Singapore, which are bound by geography and a shared history, could work together to \u201cproduce win-win outcomes with tangible benefits for their people and businesses\u201d.\nAlso present at Tuesday\u2019s dinner at the Istana were PM Lee\u2019s wife, Mrs Lee, Johor Queen Raja Zarith Sofiah, Johor Crown Prince Tunku Ismail Ibrahim and his wife, Che\u2019 Puan Besar Khaleeda, as well as Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam and his wife, Dr Seetha Shanmugam.\nPM Lee also said that Sultan Ibrahim served him a very \u201csedap\u201d (delicious) nasi ulam that he had requested during his last visit to Johor. Nasi ulam is a traditional Malay herb rice salad.\n\u201cI reciprocated his gracious hospitality by serving him crab curry along with some of his other favourite local dishes,\u201d PM Lee wrote, adding that they also met at the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix in September."}
