Police said arrests would continue for months.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said more than 6,000 public order-trained officers would be on duty over the weekend.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the strongest national policing responses that we\u2019ve ever done, certainly in my career history,\u201d said Mr Gavin Stephens, the NPCC\u2019s chairman.\nWhile police said it was not clear how many, if any, anti-migrant demonstrations might be held, about 40 counterprotests were due to take place on Aug 10, according to a group called Stand Up To Racism.\nTurning point?\nMr Stephens said tough action and the strong message by communities against the riots represented \u201cpotentially the start of a turning point\u201d.\nThe first soccer matches of the season this weekend could pose problems, although there was no specific intelligence about such risks.\nCharges have also been brought against some people involved in counterprotests.\nA local councillor who was suspended by Mr Starmer\u2019s Labour Party after footage emerged of him calling for people to cut the throats of \u201cdisgusting Nazi fascists\u201d was charged with encouraging violent disorder.\nCabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told Sky News the government would revisit the framework of legislation that regulates the responsibilities of social media companies regarding content inciting violence or hate.\n\"We stand ready to make changes if necessary,\" he said of the Online Safety Act, passed in October but not due to come into effect until 2025 due to a consultation process.
