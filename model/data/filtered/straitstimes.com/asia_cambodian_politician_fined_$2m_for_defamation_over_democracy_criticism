Vannol is currently out of the country, and his lawyer did not answer calls from Reuters.\nSuccessive Cambodian governments have repeatedly denied cracking down on opponents and say politicians and activists are prosecuted only if they have committed offences.\nConcerns about political freedom in Cambodia have continued to deepen.\nAnalysts say Mr Hun Sen\u2019s rule was marked by the suppression of the opposition, shuttering of independent media and the jailing of activists.\n\u201cAs an opposition party president, Vannol gave comments critical of his political rival to journalists \u2013 how can that possibly be a crime?\u201d said Licadho deputy director Naly Pilorge.\n\u201cAny hope for democracy and political freedom relies on the ability of all citizens to freely voice their concerns and criticisms of the country\u2019s political leaders.\u201d\nMr Kim Pisith, a human rights monitor present in court, said the ruling sent a chilling message that anyone who criticised the government may face court, jail time and massive fines."}
