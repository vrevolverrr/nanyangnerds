There was no immediate reaction from Moscow.\nMr Mykola Lukashuk, head of the Dnipropetrovsk region council, said 17 children have died in the region since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\u201cNo words can soothe the pain of parents who have lost the most precious thing in their lives,\u201d he said.\nThe war has killed at least 485 children in Ukraine and injured nearly 1,500, the country\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor-General said on Sunday on Telegram.\nThe missile hit a spot between two two-storey residential buildings in the Pidhorodnenska community, partially destroying them and damaging a number of houses and cars as well as infrastructure, Mr Lysak said.\n\u201cOnce again, Russia proves it is a terrorist state,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Saturday after the first reports of the explosions.\nMoscow and Kyiv deny their military forces target civilians.\nPictures posted on social media showed rescue teams working at a shattered, smouldering building amid piles of twisted building materials.\nFollowing the attack in Dnipro, Russia launched a new wave of overnight air strikes on Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force said on Sunday that it destroyed more than half of the air targets.\nFour of the six cruise missiles and three of the five Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia were downed, the air force said on Telegram.\nKyiv\u2019s city military administration earlier said all Russia-launched targets approaching the capital had been intercepted. But it said an airfield in a central region was struck.\nRussia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine\u2019s capital since May, chiefly at night, ahead of a long-expected Ukrainian counter-offensive to reclaim territory. Ukrainian officials say the Russian strikes are an attempt to inflict psychological distress on civilians. REUTERS"}
