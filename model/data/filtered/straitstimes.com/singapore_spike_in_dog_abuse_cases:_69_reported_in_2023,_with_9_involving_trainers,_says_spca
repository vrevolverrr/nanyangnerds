Training is a two-way process and your participation will help you bond with your pet, and equip you with the right skill sets and mindset to guide your pet,\u201d she said.\nIn the video, one of the men pushes down on a dog\u2019s back to get it to sit. When the dog stands back up, the man uses both his arms to shove the dog down again and it eventually sits.\nThe other man drags another dog, before appearing to hit its body and head to get it to stay in place.\nXavian and Pack\u2019s owner said that the pair have since been suspended. The Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) said it is investigating the matter.\nMs Sankar said that businesses that conduct dog training should have stringent recruitment processes and regular training for employees.\nBusinesses should develop a code of conduct for their employees and have them obtain relevant certification from government bodies before being allowed to handle animals without supervision, she added.\nThe AVS launched its Accredited Certified Dog Trainer Scheme on Dec 10, 2022, for dog trainers.\nUnder the scheme, which is voluntary, dog trainers can get certification from any of these four international animal behaviour and training organisations: the International Association of Animal Behaviour Consultants, the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers, the Animal Behaviour Society, and the American College of Veterinary Behaviourists.\nDog trainers who wish to apply for the scheme may visit AVS\u2019 website for more information.\nDog owners who wish to engage an accredited trainer may also refer to a list on the same page."}
