Beijing routinely denies allegations of cyber espionage and says it opposes all forms of cyberattack.\n\"Targets included dozens of Western governments, international organisations, and numerous companies operating in the defence industry\", the MVID said in a statement.\nIt urged organisations to adopt the \"Assume Breach\" principle, in which it is assumed that a successful digital attack has already taken place or will take place soon.\nIn April, MIVD said in its annual report that Chinese spies had targeted Dutch semiconductor, aerospace and maritime industries to try to strengthen China's armed forces.
