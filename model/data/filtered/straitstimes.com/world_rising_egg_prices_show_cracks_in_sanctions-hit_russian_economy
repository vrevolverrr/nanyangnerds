What\u2019s going on with the prices is a nightmare, and not just for eggs, but for everything,\u201d 76-year-old pensioner Yelizaveta Shalayevskaya told AFP in Moscow on Monday.\n\u201cI used to buy eggs for 70 roubles (S$1) at the shop, now it costs around 130-140,\u201d 21-year-old student Ilya Zarubin told AFP.\nMs Nina Nevarenykh, a 65-year-old pensioner, agreed that egg prices have risen sharply.\n\u201cI do not understand why (eggs) have gone up, but it\u2019s a fact... I can feel how my wallet is impacted,\u201d she said.\nExperts cited in Russian media said the increase was triggered by a rise in the prices of poultry feed and veterinary products, itself indirectly caused by Western sanctions on imported goods.\n\u2018Eggs for everyone\u2019\nThe increase has the authorities worried.\nGeneral prosecutor Igor Krasnov launched checks to probe potentially unjustified price increases from sellers and producers.\nThe Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision \u2013 Rosselkhoznadzor \u2013 in the meantime authorised the import of eggs from Turkey.\nThe agriculture ministry also suggested a six-month ban on the export of Russian eggs.\nIn the southern city of Belgorod, near Ukraine, the authorities called for calm after people queued for eggs over the weekend.\nIn a scene reminiscent of the Soviet Union, videos on social media showed people queueing in the snow in the hope of getting cheaper priced eggs at an agricultural fair.\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any shortage... there will be eggs for everyone,\u201d regional vice-governor Yulia Shchedrina said on Telegram.\nShe nonetheless announced to limit sales to 20 eggs per person.\nEgg prices are scrutinised by Russian families who are getting ready for winter celebrations.\nEggs are a vital ingredient of many traditional Russian holiday dishes including the mayonnaise-heavy Russian \u201cOlivier\u201d salad, a staple of the New Year\u2019s feast.\nMs Yelena, a 60-year-old manager living in Moscow, was not about to give up on the beloved dish.\n\u201cI will make Olivier salad for the New Year no matter what, even if food has become more expensive,\u201d she told AFP."}
