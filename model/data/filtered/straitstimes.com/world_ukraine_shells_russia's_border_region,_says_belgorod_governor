There was no immediate information on casualties and destruction, but emergency services were working on the site.\nMr Gladkov said that the shelling damaged a number of private houses, a farm, infrastructure and power lines.\nBoth sides deny targeting civilians in the 14-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine that started on Feb 24, 2022.\nUkraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia and on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.\nBut it has said recently that destroying infrastructure is preparation for a planned ground assault.
