If we are involved from the ideation process... the tech folks can help us to get what we want, and that can help us to get better products.\n\u201cWhile tech experts may have ideas, they may not know the best way that a product can fit into the clinician\u2019s workload.\u201d\nDuring the workshop, participants were guided by experts from Synapxe technology partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Avanade and Microsoft or Google Cloud to develop their ideas.\nDr Lee and his team, who are all anaesthesiologists, sought to use AI tools to sort through documents \u2013 including those from the National Electronic Health Record, surgeon notes, patient X-rays and laboratory test results \u2013 and quickly summarise each case and identify key points.\n\u201cThere are so many places to go to, to check for information,\u201d said Dr Lee.\nBy the end of the workshop, Dr Lee and his team were pleasantly surprised by what the AI tool was able to achieve. He said: \u201cWhen we tried out the case on a sample data set, we found that even without training or complex prompt engineering, we were able to get 50 per cent of what we wanted.\u201d\nHe said his team is still in touch with Synapxe and AWS to work towards creating a product that can be used in hospitals. He added that before any product can be put into clinical use, it must reach a very high standard.\nIf an AI product is selected for clinical use, it will be deployed in phases, such as starting with pilot programmes in selected healthcare facilities, said the Synapxe spokesman.\nHe said: \u201cAfter rigorous testing, feedback and iteration, the product can be considered for scale-up to more public healthcare institutions once it has proven safe and effective in the pilot programmes.\u201d\nThe aim is to harness AI, and free up healthcare professionals from administrative and repetitive tasks and allow them to focus on delivering care to patients.\nThe spokesman said: \u201cWith the secure and safe use of GenAI, we could, for example, generate condensed patient information from clinical notes, saving time and effort and enabling healthcare professionals to focus on more complex tasks and patient care.\u201d"}
