Compared with traditional construction, the company says that 3D-printing homes is faster, less expensive, requires fewer workers, and minimises construction material waste.\n\u201cIt brings a lot of efficiency to the trade market,\u201d said Icon senior project manager Conner Jenkins. \u201cSo, where there were maybe five different crews coming in to build a wall system, we now have one crew and one robot.\u201d\nAfter concrete powder, water, sand and other additives are mixed together and pumped into the printer, a nozzle squeezes out the concrete mixture like toothpaste onto a brush, building up layer by layer along a pre-programmed path that creates corduroy-effect walls.\nThe single-storey, three- to four-bedroom homes take about three weeks to finish printing, with the foundation and metal roofs installed traditionally.\nMr Jenkins said the concrete walls are designed to be resistant to water, mould, termites and extreme weather.\nMr Lawrence Nourzad, a 32-year-old business development director, and his girlfriend Ms Angela Hontas, a 29-year-old creative strategist, purchased a Wolf Ranch home earlier this summer.\n\u201cIt feels like a fortress,\u201d Mr Nourzad said, adding that he was confident it would be resilient to most tornados.\nThe walls also provide strong insulation from the Texas heat, the couple said, keeping the interior temperature cool even when the air conditioner was not on full blast.\nThere was one other thing the 3D-printed walls seemed to protect against, however: a solid, wireless internet connection.\n\u201cObviously these are really strong, thick walls. And that\u2019s what provides a lot of value for us as home owners and keeps this thing really well-insulated in a Texas summer, but signal doesn\u2019t transfer through these walls very well,\u201d Mr Nourzad said.\nTo alleviate this issue, an Icon spokeswoman said most Wolf Ranch home owners use mesh internet routers, which broadcast a signal from multiple units placed throughout a home, versus a traditional router which sends a signal from one device.\nThe 3D-printed homes at Wolf Ranch, called the Genesis Collection by developers, range in price from about US$450,000 (S$595,000) to nearly US$600,000. Developers said a little more than one-quarter of the 100 homes have been sold.\nIcon, which 3D-printed its first home in Austin in 2018, hopes to one day take its technology to the moon. Nasa, as part of its Artemis Moon exploration programme, has contracted Icon to develop a construction system capable of building landing pads, shelters and other structures on the lunar surface.
