Studies indicate that the Arctic is warming between two and four times faster than the global average.\nOne set of ice tubes will be used for immediate analysis while a second set will be sent to Antarctica for storage in an \u201cice memory sanctuary\u201d under the snow, where the samples will be preserved for future generations of scientists.\nThe eight specialists on the mission have set up camp at an altitude of 1,100m on the crevasse-ridden Holtedahlfonna ice field and plan to start drilling on Tuesday, Ice Memory said.\nThey will work for three weeks in temperatures as low as minus 25 deg C, cutting and pulling out a series of cylinders of ice, each one meter long and 10cm wide.\nThe \u20ac700,000 (S$1 million) mission, partly funded by the Italian research ministry, follows a series of earlier ice core extractions by the foundation, including operations in the Alps and the Andes.
