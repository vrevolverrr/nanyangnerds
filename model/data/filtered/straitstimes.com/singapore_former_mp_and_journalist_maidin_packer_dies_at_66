In overcoming drug and crime issues in the community, he showed me why we must continue to build over the efforts of our predecessors...\n\u201cToday, the two-year recidivism rate of Malay offenders dropped to about 25 per cent from almost 50 per cent because he too took the mantle left by others and never let a problem fester.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI am thankful for his mentorship and guidance, and the strong foundation he has built for us, generations of Malay/Muslim MPs and political office holders after him.\u201d Mr Maidin was a strong advocate for the Malay/Muslim community even before entering politics, said Mr Masagos.\nMr Maidin was a strong advocate for the Malay/Muslim community even before entering politics, Mr Masagos added.\nHe said: \u201cAs the assistant editor of Berita Harian and Berita Minggu, he was sharp in identifying issues that needed to be addressed, ensuring that the voices and concerns of the community were heard.

He reminded us to keep working for the good of the people. A reminder that my team and I would always remember.\u201d\nMr Maidin\u2019s son-in-law, creative director and photojournalist Danial Hakim, told The Straits Times that despite struggling with his health over the past few years, Mr Maidin always had the community at heart and was determined to grow the CMAC to provide a platform for Malay youth to continue appreciating their culture.\nMr Danial, 36, said: \u201cHe was my midnight \u2018teh tarik\u2019 buddy for the past seven years and his conversations with me and my wife and my close friends always centred on how, as professionals in the creative space, we have the responsibility to contribute to uphold values as a Singaporean. It was always about putting people first and making sure that what we do has meaning.\n\u201cHe was always a jester and a cheeky guy and always brought laughter and joy to the table. His warmth will be sorely missed.\u201d"}
