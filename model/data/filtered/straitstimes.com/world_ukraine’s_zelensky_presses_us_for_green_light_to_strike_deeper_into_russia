We persuade. We present arguments.\u201d\nHe said that clearing the Ukrainian sky of Russian guided aerial bombs would be \u201ca strong step to force Russia to seek an end to the war and a just peace\u201d.\nAppealing to the US, Britain, France and Germany, he said: \u201cWe need the capabilities to truly and fully protect Ukraine and Ukrainians.\n\u201cWe need both the permissions for long-range capabilities and your long-range shells and missiles.\u201d\nWithout providing specifics, he said his representatives had \u201cprovided all the necessary details\u201d to Ukraine\u2019s partners.\nUkrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, in Washington with a delegation on Aug 30 and 31 to meet US officials and experts, said in an interview broadcast by CNN that Kyiv was showing that Russian airfields used to hit Ukrainian cities were within range of deep strikes.\n\u201cWe have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect the citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,\u201d Mr Umerov said in the interview late on Aug 30.\nMr Zelensky is expected to deliver a similar plea in person in October, when he will present a plan for victory to President Joe Biden, who is nearing the end of his time in the Oval Office, and attend United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York.\nEconomy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who headed Kyiv\u2019s delegation, said in a post on social media platform X that she had discussed the steps needed to restore Ukraine\u2019s energy system, including a \u201csignificant contribution\u201d being made by an US$800 million energy sector financing package that was announced in June.\nRussian air strikes have affected more than half of Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure, she said.\nThe President\u2019s chief of staff, Mr Andriy Yermak, joined Mr Umerov in briefing US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin about the situation on the battlefield in the first meeting of their visit on Aug 30, the presidential office said in a statement.\nSpeaking at the end of a week when Russia hit Ukraine with more than 400 missiles and drones, Mr Yermak said it was important for Ukraine to receive weapons from existing defence packages as soon as possible, the office said.
