The decision opens a path to supplying Ukraine with the fighter jets.\nThe officials said the US and its allies would discuss in the coming months how to supply Kyiv with the jets, and one senior administration official said the White House was prepared to approve that step.\nThe US is not expected, at least under current plans, to send its own F-16s.\n\u201cI welcome the historic decision of the United States... to support an international fighter jet coalition. This will greatly enhance our army in the sky,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is expected to address the G-7 this weekend, wrote on Twitter."}
