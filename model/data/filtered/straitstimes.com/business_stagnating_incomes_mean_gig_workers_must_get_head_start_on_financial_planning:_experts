When that happens, where will our income come from?\n\u201cYou do not stop working and then start to figure out where the income comes from. You have to start planning this from the very beginning.\u201d\nThis is not easy, though, as 29-year-old foodpanda delivery rider Woon Ern Chong knows all too well.\nMr Woon, who is a part-time student, acknowledges that one cannot save and plan for the future if one does not even have money for basic living expenses. That is what led him to take on delivery work to earn extra cash.\nHe also reviewed his monthly expenses and found some areas where he could cut back.\n\u201cYou may find that you often spend more than you think you do,\u201d he said.\nMr Woon saves money by resisting the temptation to buy the latest mobile phones or gadgets, instead going for more budget-friendly brands and models.\nHe also custom-builds his own computers.\nHe hopes that being frugal will allow him to bolster his savings to pay for the renovations and mortgage payments on his Build-to-Order flat in 2025.\nIt has certainly become more important for platform workers to be prudent.\nA Ministry of Manpower report showed that the median gross monthly income of full-time platform-related occupations was $2,000 in 2023, unchanged from 2022.\nSuch workers are self-employed, and include delivery workers, private-hire car drivers and taxi drivers. They use online platforms such as Grab to search for customers.\nPrivate-hire car drivers earned around $2,500 a month in 2023, while delivery workers like Mr Woon picked up $2,000 and taxi drivers $1,500 \u2013 all unchanged from 2022.\nWhile earnings did not go up in 2023, inflation remained a challenge, with the cost of living rising 4.8 per cent from 2022.\nCore inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport costs, rose 4.2 per cent over the same period.\nDeveloping good saving habits is essential, said experts.\nA good rule of thumb is to save at least 20 per cent of income, spend 50 per cent on financial needs and the remaining 30 per cent on wants and discretionary spending, said Mr Samuel Rhee, co-founder and chairman of digital wealth platform Endowus.\nMr Rhee urges platform workers to build up an emergency fund of around six months of expenses that they can draw on for unexpected situations, like a job loss or a medical crisis.\nPhillip Securities\u2019 Mr Lee believes platform workers should set aside even more for emergencies \u2013 a fund of as much as 12 to 18 months of expenses.\n\u201cYou cannot adopt the mindset of \u2018I earned more this month and I should treat myself\u2019.\n\u201cSet aside at least a part of that extra income for a rainy day,\u201d he said.\nMr Rhee said platform workers should not neglect longer-term goals, such as planning for retirement.\nInflation has pushed up the cost of living and people are living longer, he added, so they should plan for the long term to \u201cmaintain sustainable standards of living during retirement\u201d.\n\u201cIt will be deeply unfortunate for someone to work hard for many years, only to realise... that they do not have enough of a retirement nest egg to sustain a decent quality of life. This is what we call old-age poverty,\u201d Mr Rhee said.\nThe Central Provident Fund (CPF) should form the basic foundation of anyone\u2019s retirement plan, said Ms Daphne Lye, solutions lead at MoneyOwl, which is now under Temasek Trust.\nPlatform workers aged below 30 in 2024, meaning those born in or after 1995, will have to contribute more to their CPF from the second half of 2024. Older platform workers can also opt in and contribute more.\nWhile there are concerns about a drop in take-home pay, Ms Lye said the workers will benefit in the longer term from the risk-free interest rates.\nSavings in the CPF Ordinary Account earn at least 2.5 per cent, while the Special Account pays at least 4 per cent interest annually.\nFurthermore, platform companies have to contribute to their workers\u2019 CPF, she said, adding that \u201cit is additional monies that you will get\u201d.\n\u201cYou have to take a longer view,\u201d she said.\nAll this planning will go awry if a major illness or accident hits, which is why platform workers should consider insurance coverage for hospitalisation and critical illnesses.\nThey may also want to get their own insurance for personal accidents, even though they will be entitled to compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act from the second half of 2024.\nMr Lee noted that there are low-cost insurance plans that platform workers can consider.\n\u201cJust get a five-year renewable term plan. When you are in your 20s, it is really cheap. Just a couple of tens of dollars a month,\u201d he said.\nWith the basic building blocks in place \u2013 savings, emergency funds and insurance \u2013 platform workers can consider investing if they have extra cash.\nMr Lee said they should look at creating side income streams so that they can transition from being fully reliant on their platform income to being partially reliant.\nFor example, as age catches up with them and they are no longer able to do deliveries, they will still have external sources of income from their investments, which can include dividend-paying stocks, unit trusts or Singapore Savings Bonds.\nMs Lye suggested that platform workers look at investing into low-cost, globally diversified portfolios.\nHowever they decide to invest, their investment plan or portfolio should fit their risk tolerance and wealth goals, Mr Rhee said, adding that they should not change their plans unless something has altered fundamentally in their life.\nHe also said that investors should not have to stress over rebalancing their portfolios whenever markets are volatile.\n\u201cThey should have peace of mind, and be confident that they can ride out the storm,\u201d he added."}
