The time without sunlight and in isolation made me lose my mind and become frightful.\u201d\nNg was convicted by a federal jury in April of three felony counts, including conspiring to violate US anti-bribery laws and conspiring to launder money.\nTim Leissner, Ng\u2019s former Goldman boss, pleaded guilty and was the government\u2019s star witness at trial.\nLeissner will be sentenced in September.\nGoldman paid more than US$2.3 billion (S$3.1 billion) in the plea deal, the largest penalty in US history for a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
