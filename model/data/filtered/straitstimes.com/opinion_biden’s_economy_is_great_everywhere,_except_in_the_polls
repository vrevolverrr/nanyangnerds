Only 35 per cent of voters in seven swing states trust Mr Biden on the economy, according to a Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll, with 51 per cent saying it was better under Donald Trump.\nThis is undoubtedly a frustrating situation for the President, his campaign and Democrats overall. But they can take solace, if that\u2019s the word, from the fact that Mr Biden is doing better than most of his peers around the world."}
