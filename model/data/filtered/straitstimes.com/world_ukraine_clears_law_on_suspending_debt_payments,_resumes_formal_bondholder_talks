The IMF did not immediately comment.\nWARRANTS\nUkraine has $19.7 billion outstanding on its international bonds and owes $2.6 billion on GDP warrants - a fixed-income instrument with payouts that are linked to the strength of growth in economic output.\nThe warrants were created as a sweetener to creditors during Ukraine's 2015 debt restructuring in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea.\nIn a call with investors earlier this month, sources told Reuters that Ukraine said it intended to restructure the warrants during the current talks - a change from its earlier plans.\nWarrant payments are included in the IMF's debt sustainability analysis (DSA), and paying those holders would syphon money away from the largely token coupon payments that the government proposed to make to bondholders under the restructuring.\nUkraine's sovereign dollar bonds barely moved on Thursday, but were trading between 29.34 to 31.26 cents on the dollar, roughly 2 cents above the level when the first talks derailed. The increase suggested hope that a deal could be reached.\nUkraine previously enacted a debt payment moratorium law in May 2015 amid restructuring talks. That year, it reached an agreement in principle with investors at the end of August, and announced the settlement of the transaction in November. REUTERS"}
