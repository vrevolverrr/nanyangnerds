The\u2026 border is pretty long. Yet again, there will be a spot where things will get hot.\u201d\nHe was asked repeatedly about Western media reports that his militia had used United States military equipment that was meant to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, but he declined to answer directly.\n\u201cI know exactly where I got my weapons from. Unfortunately, not from the Western partners,\u201d he said.\nHe also suggested that Western military equipment had been captured by Russia in the battle for Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, and that such equipment could be bought on the black market.\n\u201cI think I explained that the Western military aid unfortunately goes back and forth, being raided. In Bakhmut for instance I know that a lot of armoured vehicles, American armoured vehicles, got raided by the Russian forces,\u201d he said.\nMr Kapustin said Ukraine only supported the RVC with information, petrol, food and medicine.\n\u201cAnd, of course, the Ukrainian military took our wounded. But anything more than this would make things difficult.\u201d\n\u201cEvery decision we make\u2026 beyond the state border is our own decision. Obviously, we can ask our (Ukrainian) comrades, friends for their assistance in planning,\u201d he added."}
