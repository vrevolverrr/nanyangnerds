It said: \u201cThey had initially agreed but in the end did not turn up for the scheduled interview, left Singapore on June 15, 2022, and have not returned since.\u201d\nThe subject of Mr Lee\u2019s possible return to Singapore re-emerged following the death of his older sister, Dr Lee Wei Ling, on Oct 9. Mr Lee had earlier said he would not be returning to Singapore for the wake and funeral, and that his son Li Huanwu would be helping with them.\nDr Lee died aged 69, four years after being diagnosed with a rare brain disorder called progressive supranuclear palsy.\nIn 2023, Mr Lee said in a Facebook post that he may never return to Singapore amid the ongoing police investigation, the root of which is a legal disagreement between Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his younger siblings over the fate of their late father\u2019s house in Oxley Road.\nAmong the differences was a demolition clause \u2013 relating to the demolition of the 38 Oxley Road house after Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s death \u2013 which had not been in the sixth or penultimate will but was in the last.\nThis clause became a sticking point among the late Mr Lee\u2019s children.\nIn 2020, the Court of Three Judges and a disciplinary tribunal found that Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern had lied under oath during disciplinary proceedings against Mrs Lee, a lawyer, over her handling of the last will of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who died on March 23, 2015, at the age of 91.\nThe police then became involved."}
