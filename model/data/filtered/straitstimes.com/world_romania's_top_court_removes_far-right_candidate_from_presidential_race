Politicians across the political spectrum said the ruling was an unprecedented threat to democratic values.\nBecause the nine-member court is politically appointed, many politicians also accused it of interference.\nOpinion surveys show leftist Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is likely to go through to the second round of the presidential election, but it is unclear who he will run against.\nAlthough the role is largely ceremonial, the president's powers include nominating the prime minister after elections and appointing judges and prosecutors. They also include oversight of foreign policy, meaning the new president will play a critical role in Romania's commitment to supporting Ukraine. REUTERS"}
