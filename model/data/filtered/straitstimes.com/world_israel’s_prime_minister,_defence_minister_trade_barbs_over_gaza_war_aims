A day later, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, drawing vows of retaliation from Iran.\nThe public reprimand of Mr Gallant, who has repeatedly clashed with Mr Netanyahu and the nationalist-religious parties in his coalition, was the latest episode of internal strife that has persisted since the government took office in 2022.\nIn 2023, Mr Netanyahu tried to sack Mr Gallant over his opposition to plans to curb the power of the Supreme Court, only to have to reverse course in the face of mass protests by hundreds of thousands of Israelis.\nThe latest exchange comes ahead of a last-ditch attempt to revive Egyptian and Qatari-brokered talks to halt the fighting in Gaza and bring back 115 Israeli and foreign hostages still held in the battered enclave.\nHamas has said it will not send a delegation to the meeting, accusing Mr Netanyahu of wanting to waste time rather than make an honest attempt to reach a deal.
