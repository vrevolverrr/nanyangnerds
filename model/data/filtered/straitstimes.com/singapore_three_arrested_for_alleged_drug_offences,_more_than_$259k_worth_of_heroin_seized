These included 67.17kg of heroin and 26.75kg of Ice, or methamphetamine. In 2021, CNB seized 95.43kg of heroin and 49.95kg of Ice.\nThe number of new drug abusers nabbed in 2022 decreased by 15 per cent to 797, compared with 936 in 2021.\nNonetheless, CNB director Sam Tee called for a clear zero-tolerance stand against drug abuse, saying people should speak out against it.\n\u201cSingapore\u2019s focus is on building a drug-free society, not a drug-tolerant one,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs a small nation, we can ill afford the societal devastation that can be caused by widespread drug addiction as witnessed in other countries.\u201d\nInvestigations are ongoing."}
