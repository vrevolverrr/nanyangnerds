US media reported several other states were also reporting cases.\nDr Thomas Haupt, a respiratory disease epidemiologist with Wisconsin's Department of Health Services, told AFP on Thursday: \"We're in the process of interviewing all of our patients, to try to find out any commonalities.\n\"At this particular point, vaping is the only thing that they have in common, but we're trying to cast a broader net and just make sure that we are not missing something as well.\"\nThe findings have baffled experts, since e-cigarettes have been available in the US since 2006 and scientific research so far suggests they are probably a less toxic alternative to smoking.\nTheir use among adolescents has skyrocketed in recent years: some 3.6 million middle and high school students used vaping products in 2018, an increase of 1.5 million on the year before, according to the report by the CDC.\nDr Haupt told AFP that the Wisconsin cases were not confined to teens - the confirmed cases included users into their mid-30s while the suspected cases included people in their 50s.\nMany had to receive mechanical assistance in breathing, while imaging revealed infiltrates, and \"ground glass opacities\" that indicate abnormalities in the alveoli.\nBut they responded well to steroid treatment and were later discharged, and will receive follow-up scans a few weeks from now to determine whether there has been any permanent damage.\n\"This is an eye-opening investigation for us,\" Dr Haupt said, adding that the patients had no underlying illnesses that would put them at risk for complications.\n\"We always encourage parents to talk to their children about this. If they do vape, it has to come from a reputable dealer,\" he added."}
