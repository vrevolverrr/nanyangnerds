Dui, which means verandah, has also given way to baranda from Bengali.\nUsed as bonded workers by the Bhutias, a dominant tribal group in the region until around the mid-19th century, the Totos today primarily live off their land, cultivating crops such as betel nut, and rearing livestock.\nDaily wage work at farms and construction sites is another key source of earnings for this community that counts just around 10 graduates and is almost entirely based in Totopara.\nThe Totos\u2019 existence on the margins mirrors the linguistic plight of many other remotely located communities in the country. But just as the Totos, who are fighting back, several threatened linguistic groups are endeavouring to protect their languages.\nIn central India, Gondi speakers have sought to standardise their language spoken by around 2.9 million Gonds and generate a shareable lingua franca through public workshops.\nFarther up north, in Uttarakhand state, volunteers have organised pop-up language classes and trained adult teachers to help preserve Raji, a language spoken by fewer than a thousand members of traditionally nomadic communities.\nIn Bihar in the east, activists have developed tools to give Angika, a vulnerable language, greater space online.\nAny language is integral to a community\u2019s identity and offers insights into its world view. For example, the family of Great Andamanic languages, spoken in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal, have a word (raupuch) to describe a person who has lost his siblings, implying how important family kinship is for them.\nIndia is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world, with the People\u2019s Linguistic Survey of India (PLSI), a civil society initiative launched in 2010, documenting as many as 780 languages.\nThe state, however, has been less magnanimous in recognising this diversity. Its decennial census, which records only languages with more than 10,000 speakers, listed 121 languages in its 2011 edition, wiping the others off the map.\nThe country\u2019s linguistic diversity is further pared down with the federal government recognising only 22 of these languages as official, which it is constitutionally obligated to protect and nurture.\nThe vast majority of the \u201cunofficial\u201d languages \u2013 victims of official apathy \u2013 are spoken by marginalised communities, primarily around the Himalayas and in less developed regions of central India such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\nThe Unesco\u2019s Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages in Danger estimates around 170 languages are under threat in India, more than half of which are Tibeto-Burman languages in the north-east.\nThese languages are endangered, it said, because learning them has become \u201cunfashionable\u201d. They are no longer transmitted from one generation to another and have limited state support, which also results in their absence from school curricula.\nIn Totopara, demands for Toto language education in schools, including government ones, have fallen on deaf ears. But that has not stopped Mr Soney Toto, 28, and some of his friends from teaching the language and its script to children at a private school in the village.\nOnce every week, around 95 children from the Chittaranjan Toto Memorial Education Centre \u2013 both Totos and non-Totos \u2013 gather to learn the language and master its nasal consonants such as \u201cng\u201d.\n\u201cWhile we assimilate with the world outside, we are also striving to keep our identity alive,\u201d said Mr Soney Toto (all Totos carry the same surname), who also teaches English. \u201cWe may be poor, but we are culturally rich,\u201d he told The Straits Times.\nThe Toto dictionary\u2019s publication was supported by Calcutta Comparatists 1919, a collective of humanities and social sciences scholars that seeks to bring marginalised languages and communities into the limelight.\nDr Mrinmoy Pramanick, an assistant professor at the University of Calcutta\u2019s Department of Comparative Indian Language and Literature, said the collective resists India\u2019s \u201cmainstream academic culture\u201d that takes away from many the right of education in their mother tongues.\n\u201cIf children are not educated in their mother tongues, they are burdened by the need to acquire another language for their education, which makes it difficult for them and causes them to lose their basic confidence and expression,\u201d he added.\nWhile the government has a national scheme to document endangered languages, the overall lack of state recognition and support for languages on the margins has hastened the migration of their speakers to dominant speech forms as they look out for economic opportunities.\nBecause of such a process, many minor languages are today used for fewer daily functions, becoming unviable for their communities and dying a silent and protracted death.\n\u201cThis form of language loss is a cancer, not a gunshot,\u201d according to Mr Frederico Andrade, co-founder of Wikitongues, a crowdsourced project that aims to archive every language in the world.\nAccording to Mr Ganesh Devy, who led the PLSI, India may have lost around 220 languages in 50 years since 1961. This list now includes Sare, one of the world\u2019s oldest surviving languages, which went extinct in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands when its last speaker, Mrs Licho, died in April 2020.\nIn Totopara, the Totos learn Bengali, which is the official and most widely spoken language in the state of West Bengal. Not just that, they also have to pick up Nepali and Hindi, which are spoken by more numerous communities in the region and with whom the Totos must conduct business.\nMr Dhaniram Toto, who developed the alphabet and script for Toto language, had to deal with this dilemma when a youth once asked him why he should learn Toto instead of English and if he could get a job by doing so.\n\u201cI told him even learning English doesn\u2019t guarantee you a job these days,\u201d joked the 60-year-old, a published Bengali novelist who in March was awarded the Padma Shri, one of India\u2019s top civilian honours, for his efforts to preserve the Toto language and culture.\nBut Mr Dhaniram Toto also told the youth that irrespective of whether learning Toto helps him land a job or not, he has to save his language. \u201cAs a Toto, you can learn English, French, Russian or any other language, I have no problem. But you need to protect your community\u2019s linguistic symbol too,\u201d he added.\nIt is such determination that led him to create the alphabet and script for Toto in 2019, so that the language could be better documented for posterity. \u201cEven if it is of an embarrassing standard, I told myself my language had to have an alphabet too,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am a pothodarkshak,\u201d added Mr Dhaniram Toto, using the Bengali word for someone who shows the path ahead. \u201cMaybe in another 50 years you will see that better Toto alphabets will emerge from it and the coming generations will improve it further.\u201d"}
