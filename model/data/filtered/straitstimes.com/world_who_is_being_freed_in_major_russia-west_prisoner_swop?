He was convicted of espionage in 2020 and handed a 16-year sentence. He denied the charges.\nAt the time of his arrest, Whelan was head of global security for BorgWarner, a Michigan-based car parts supplier. Russian investigators said he was a spy for military intelligence and had been caught red-handed with a computer flash drive containing classified information.\nThe US invariably referred to the cases of Gershkovich and Whelan side-by-side, saying both were being used as bargaining chips by Moscow. It designated both as \"wrongfully detained\", meaning it considered the cases politically motivated and was committed to trying to get them home.\nRoman Seleznev\nThe son of a Russian lawmaker, Seleznev was found guilty by a US federal court in Washington state in 2016 of perpetrating a cyber assault on thousands of US businesses that involved hacking into point-of-sales computers to steal credit card numbers, resulting in US$169 million in losses.\nHe was sentenced in 2017 to 27 years in prison, the longest ever hacking-related sentence in the US\nThat same year, Seleznev pleaded guilty to participating in a racketeering scheme in Nevada and conspiracy to commit bank fraud in Georgia and received a 14-year jail term for each, to run concurrently with the Washington sentence.\nDissidents jailed in Russia\nVladimir Kara-Murza\nKara-Murza is a Russian and British national who was serving a 25-year sentence in a Siberian penal colony. He was convicted of treason in 2023, in a case he compared to the Stalinist show trials of the 1930s, after he repeatedly condemned Russia's war in Ukraine and called for Western sanctions against Moscow.\nFollowing the death of Alexei Navalny in February, he is the best-known dissident now imprisoned in Russia. He suffers from a nerve condition after surviving two poisoning attempts in the 2010s, and his supporters have voiced fears for his life.\nAlthough not a US national, he has connections to the United States - he advocated for the adoption of the Magnitsky Act imposing sanctions against individuals responsible for human rights abuses, and was a pall-bearer at the funeral of Republican senator John McCain.\nEven from prison, he has published columns in the Washington Post, for which he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in May.\nIlya Yashin\nYashin, 41, was jailed in December 2022 for eight and a half years on charges of spreading \"false information\" about the Russian army, part of a package of sweeping wartime censorship laws.\nHe was convicted over statements he made on his YouTube channel about alleged war crimes by Russian forces in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha in the first weeks of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nHaving risen to prominence during a wave of anti-Kremlin protests in 2011-12, Yashin was elected head of a Moscow district council in 2017, but has been repeatedly blocked from standing for higher office. Like many other leading opposition figures, he was branded a \"foreign agent\" by the Russian government.\nYashin was a longtime friend and ally of the late Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony in February.
