The government did not provide a breakdown of the number of visas granted to Malaysians.\nThe scheme offers a two-year visa\u00ad to applicants who earned at least HK$2.5 million (S$434,000) in the past year, or graduates from nearly 200 of the world\u2019s top universities.\nThe Malaysian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macau said the scheme had already benefited some Malaysian professionals with its simplified visa procedures.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s focus on talent recruitment in Malaysia reflects its commitment to fostering a diversified and skilled workforce,\u201d the chamber told The Straits Times.\nNurturing greater cultural sensitivity and ensuring more access to halal goods would also help attract more Malaysian talents including Muslims to Hong Kong, the chamber said.\nMalaysian Yee Lisan, 34, who relocated to Hong Kong as a regional marketing manager at a music label in April 2021, said she enjoys the quality of life in Hong Kong.\n\u201cMy favourite thing about Hong Kong is the fact that I can head to the beach, hills or to the city all within 20 minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Malaysia, I would have had to take a long stretch of leave just to spend a proper day at the beach. So, I appreciate the convenience of this compact city.\u201d\nBut Hong Kong is lacking in some areas, she said. \u201cWhen my Muslim friends visit, for example, it can be difficult taking them around for meals as the halal options here are extremely limited.\u201d\nHong Kong officials said in May that they were striving to offer more halal food options across the city to woo more visitors from South-east Asia, the Middle East and other Muslim-majority regions.\nLawmakers have, in recent days, raised concern about a lack of diversity in Hong Kong\u2019s imported labour force, with mainlanders accounting for three in four of the 180,000 workers brought to the city across all talent schemes since December 2022.\nBut Mr Sun on June 24 urged them to look past the newcomers\u2019 nationalities. The fact that most of the younger candidates from the top talent scheme graduated from US universities also accounted for diversity, even if many of them were mainlanders, he argued.\nStill, as the possibility rises of foreigners \u2013 particularly in the lower-educated segment of the labour force \u2013 crowding the job market, local workers in some sectors are feeling threatened.\nTwo workers\u2019 unions on June 20 jointly spoke out to oppose a government plan to further raise a quota for imported residential care home workers to 15,000. That quota was raised from 4,000 to 7,000 in June 2023, and will now more than double from July 1.\n\u201cRather than supporting local employment, the government has instead brought a huge threat to it,\u201d the Health Services Employees Association and the Caregiving Services Employees Association said in their statement.\nIn April, unions representing workers in bus services lambasted a government move to allow bus service operator Citybus to hire 20 mainland drivers to alleviate what officials said was a \u201csevere labour shortage\u201d.\n\u201cThis time they will import only 20 drivers. But it will be a huge problem if they import more,\u201d a member of the Motor Transport Workers General Union complained at the time.\nProfessor Terence Chong, an economist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told ST it was \u201cmyopic\u201d to think that imported workers would necessarily hurt locals\u2019 livelihoods, as an insufficient supply of labour would end up hurting the economy and all Hong Kongers.\n\u201cImporting labour is a good way to fill up vacant job roles, especially in the jobs that most locals aren\u2019t willing to take, such as being care home workers,\u201d Prof Chong said.\nHong Kong has been ramping up recruitment of imported workers in an effort to plug large gaps in its labour force, in higher-skilled and professional services as well as other sectors including construction, transport and health.\nIt lost more than 250,000 members of its 3.99 million-member workforce between 2019 and 2022, as locals and expatriates alike left following the 2019 mass anti-government protests, the 2020 imposition of a national security law and tight Covid-19 restrictions during the pandemic that saw the city mostly shut to the world.\nLabour groups have criticised the government\u2019s efforts to bring more workers into the city as bypassing union leaders\u2019 scrutiny and disregarding local workers\u2019 concerns.\nBut Prof Chong said the government\u2019s labour importation policies since late 2022 have, in fact, helped replenish the city\u2019s labour supply.\nThe workforce has since recovered to about 3.81 million as at May, according to the latest data from the Census and Statistics Department.\nHong Kong\u2019s unemployment rate has also stabilised at around 3 per cent, compared with around 5 per cent during the pandemic, the economist added.\n\u201cWe have to look at labour issues from the interests of Hong Kong as a whole, rather than just from one side of any particular sector,\u201d he said."}
