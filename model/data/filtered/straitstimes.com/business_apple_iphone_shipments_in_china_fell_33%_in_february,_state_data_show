Apple accounts for the vast majority of those shipments, as the only overseas player with a meaningful market share.\nThe February decline marks a second consecutive month of lower shipments. In January, the company shipped a total of roughly 5.5 million units, or about 39 per cent fewer handsets than in the prior year, according to China Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures.\nApple shares dropped 0.7 per cent in New York on March 26. They have declined about 12 per cent so far in 2024, making Apple an outlier among its Big Tech peers.\nApple has seen its best-selling product struggle in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market since the September debut of its latest generation models. The return of Huawei Technologies as a viable rival in the premium phone segment has stolen share away from Apple and the slowdown in iPhone sales prompted rare discounts from the US company in January.\n\u201cApple\u2019s retail channels in China are still digesting the shipment from the fourth quarter of 2023, that could explain the drop in recent months,\u201d said Ms Nicole Peng, an analyst at Canalys. \u201cBut it\u2019s a sign of a slowing trend for the upcoming months for Apple in China, especially when the Chinese peers are driving very aggressively the AI smartphone messages.\u201d\nThe overall Chinese smartphone market also contracted by almost a third in February, illustrating a wider consumer reluctance to spend on discretionary items.\nAnalysts still predict growth over the course of the year, but they expect iPhone sales to keep deteriorating. Jefferies analysts led by Mr Edison Lee said in a note this week that they see the iPhone leading market declines with more than 20 per cent for the year so far. BLOOMBERG"}
