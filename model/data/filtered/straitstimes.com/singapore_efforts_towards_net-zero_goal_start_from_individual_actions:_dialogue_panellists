Her habits include bringing reusable takeaway boxes when she buys food, shopping for clothes only when necessary, and eating less meat to reduce methane emissions.\nMore than 200 people were at the dialogue, which was the third of a three-part series. The first was on women\u2019s development and the second was on the challenges faced by vulnerable groups in society.\nMany in the audience of mainly Mandarin-speaking elderly Singaporeans shared their sustainable practices, such as growing vegetables and using reusable tote bags for grocery runs."}
