Is that enough?\u2019\u201d recounted the doctor, who was eventually allowed to perform the abortion \u2013 weeks later.\nThe report also said restricting abortion has led to delayed mismanagement of miscarriages out of fear they will be treated as abortions.\nDoctors who don\u2019t want to risk legal issues end up passing on treatment, lengthening wait times that could lead to complications.\n\u201cIt is a hard situation to be in just trying to do what is legal but also do what is right,\u201d said one medical professional.
