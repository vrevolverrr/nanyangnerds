His lawyers weren\u2019t allowed access to him,\u201d Mrs Evgenia Kara-Murza said, in a social media post, adding that she had no information on his condition.\nShe said her husband had been transferred from the IK-6 high-security prison colony in the Siberian region of Omsk where he is serving his sentence to a regional prison hospital.\n\u201cHis lawyers, who had travelled to IK-6 from Moscow and had been waiting from 8:30 in the morning on Thursday, were informed about this in the afternoon after more than five hours of waiting,\u201d she said.\nAfter travelling to the hospital, they were first told Kara-Murza was not there, and then after visiting hours closed the facility confirmed to them he had been admitted.\nStaff there continued to deny access to his lawyers on July 5, saying he had not been fully processed and was then being seen by doctors, Mrs Kara-Murza said.\n\u201cThus, the lawyers were not able to see Vladimir and make sure that he was alright,\u201d she said.\nThey may not be able to try again until after the weekend, she added.\n\u2018Threat to life\u2019\nKara-Murza vocally campaigned against President Putin for years, and stayed inside the country to criticise Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, even as Moscow passed a raft of anti-dissent and military censorship laws.\nHundreds have been prosecuted under the measures and most Russian opposition figures not in jail have fled into exile.\nThe Kremlin critic - who is a dual Russian-UK citizen - suffers from a nerve condition after he fell severely ill in 2015 and 2017 in what he says were poisonings orchestrated by Russia\u2019s FSB security service.\nAn investigation led by Bellingcat journalists in 2021 also suggested that FSB agents were involved in both cases.\nHe was arrested in April 2022 and sentenced a year later after blasting Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and pressing Western countries to impose sanctions against the Kremlin."}
