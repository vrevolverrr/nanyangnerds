The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review\u201d.\nThere was no immediate comment on the incident from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office.\nDr Fouad Nafaa, head of Rafidia Hospital in Nablus, told Reuters that Ms Eygi had arrived there in critical condition with a serious head injury.\n\u201cWe tried to perform a resuscitation operation on her, but unfortunately she died,\u201d he said.\nMs Eygi had recently graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, the school\u2019s president, Professor Ana Mari Cauce, said in a statement, describing the news of her death as \u201cawful\u201d and saying Ms Eygi had a \u201cpositive influence\u201d on other students.\nHer family described her as a \u201cfiercely passionate human rights activist\u201d who had recently participated in college campus protests against US support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\nTheir statement called on President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris to pursue an independent US probe into her killing.\n\u2018Deeply disturbed\u2019\nThe White House\u2019s National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Washington was \u201cdeeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen\u201d in the West Bank on Sept 6.\n\u201cWe have reached out to the government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident,\u201d Mr Savett said.\nUS Senator Chris Van Hollen said Ms Eygi was the third American killed in the West Bank since Oct 7, when Hamas militants\u2019 attack on Israel sparked war in Gaza and a resurgence of West Bank violence.\nThe war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has entered its 12th month, with little sign of respite for the Palestinian territory.\nIsraeli military strikes across the Palestinian Gaza Strip killed at least 61 people in the space of 48 hours, local medics said on Sept 7.\nNumerous rounds of diplomacy have so far failed to clinch a ceasefire deal to end the conflict and bring the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza, as well as many Palestinians jailed in Israel.\nUS Central Investigation Agency director William Burns, the chief US negotiator trying to help secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages by Hamas, said on Sept 7 that a more detailed proposal on the ceasefire would be made in the coming days.\nIn a separate incident on Sept 6 near Beita, in the village of Qaryut, a 13-year-old girl was killed by Israeli gunfire, Palestinian health officials said, after settlers attacked the village.\nWafa quoted the girl\u2019s father as saying she was in their home when it was hit by gunfire. The Israeli military said it was investigating after its troops had fired in the air to disperse what it described as violent confrontations between dozens of settlers and Palestinians in the area."}
