Insp-Gen Shabtai said 527 such squads have been created since Oct 7.\nMr Eliezer Rosenbaum, deputy director-minister of Mr Ben-Gvir\u2019s ministry, told lawmakers that 20,000 firearms had been ordered for distribution to such squads, with another 20,000 to follow.\nHe said volunteers would also be issued with flak jackets and helmets.\nHe did not elaborate on the kind of firearms involved.\nMr Ben-Gvir has posted online video footage of himself handing out M-16 or M-4 assault rifles.\nMs Naella Gelkopf-Belais, a social activist from the mixed Israeli-Arab city of Haifa, said police should work with the civic authorities and be wary of \u201cthe creation of private militias\u201d.\n\u201cWe in the city are on a tinderbox,\u201d she said.\nInsp-Gen Shabtai said security squads would be subordinate to police.\n\u201cIt is good that there will be a lot of security squads and force, but caution must be exercised with this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is permitted and what is forbidden must be understood, and care must be taken that no finger is too light on the trigger.\u201d REUTERS"}
