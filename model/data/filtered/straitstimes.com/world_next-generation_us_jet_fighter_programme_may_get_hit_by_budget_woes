There are currently 185 F-22s in service \u2013 the plane NGAD is meant to replace.\nThe air force is also reviewing the concept for the jet \u2013 perhaps moving to a larger single-engine jet, from what is believed to be a two-engine design, or even shifting more funding to a less expensive unmanned drone to best address future air superiority needs given the potential budget cuts, industry experts said.\n\u201cNGAD was conceived before a number of things: before the threat became so severe, before CCAs (Collaborative Combat Aircraft programmes) were introduced into the equation, and before we had some issues with affordability that we are currently facing,\u201d US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said on July 20 at Britain\u2019s Royal International Air Tattoo, the world\u2019s largest military air show.\n\u201cBefore we commit to the 2026 budget, we want to be sure we are on the right path,\u201d he said on a programme that will be a popular talking point at the Farnborough International Airshow this week.\nThe shift in focus comes as the air force grapples with substantial cost overruns in several vital, and expensive, programmes. For example, its Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile programme, which is set to replace the ageing Minuteman III missiles, has ballooned 81 per cent over budget, to around US$141 billion.\nBudget pressure has forced the air force to reassess its spending priorities across various modernisation efforts which also include increasing production of the new B-21 bomber made by Northrop Grumman.\nUS aerospace and defence companies Lockheed Martin and Boeing have responded to the air force\u2019s request for proposal for the NGAD system, sources told Reuters.\nWhile defence firms are not exactly desperate for orders, with conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza driving already-strong demand, NGAD was one of several potentially giant programmes many hoped would feed the bottom line in the years ahead.\nAn air force spokesperson told Reuters the department is currently building its fiscal 2026 budget, which will be released in early 2025. Representatives for Boeing did not return requests for comment. Lockheed would not comment on NGAD.\n\u201cThe part that seems to be getting stalled and re-evaluated is the air vehicle itself, the central platform,\u201d said Mr J.J. Gertler, a senior analyst at aerospace and defence analysis company Teal Group.\n\u201cThe air force is now making sure that that\u2019s what they actually want and possibly changing their mind,\u201d he added.\nPossible new configurations might be shifting to a single engine for the jet to save on upfront cost and long-term maintenance. Twin-engine jets are much more expensive to buy and operate, but they are more dependable and faster, therefore more deadly in a dogfight than their single-engine foes.\nAnother key component emerging from this restructuring is the possibility of shifting funds towards the unmanned fighter drone known as the CCA initiative. Development of the less expensive drone platforms, designed to operate alongside the main jet, does not face budget changes. REUTERS"}
