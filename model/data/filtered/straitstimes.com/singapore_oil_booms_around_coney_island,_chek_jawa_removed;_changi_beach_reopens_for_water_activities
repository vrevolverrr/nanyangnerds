I would like to thank all who have come forward to volunteer with us.\u201d\nAside from boom removal, beachgoers are now permitted to return to Changi Beach for swimming and other water activities, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a Facebook post on July 6.\nNEA added that Changi Beach has not been directly impacted by the oil spill.\n\u201cWater quality has remained normal and stable in the past week, and the bulk of oil in the sea has been removed,\u201d it added. \u201cAs such, NEA will be withdrawing this advisory.\u201d\nAn advisory against such activities was issued on June 17 in response to the oil spill incident.\nOil slicks stained coastlines at East Coast Park, Labrador Nature Reserve, Keppel Bay, the Southern Islands and Sentosa on June 15.\nSome of the oil was also seen off Changi, according to a joint statement by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, NEA, National Parks Board, national water agency PUB, Sentosa Development Corporation and Singapore Food Agency on June 17.\nBased on satellite and drone images, there has been no oil slick observed at East Coast and Changi since June 18, The Straits Times reported on June 25.\nOn June 14, the Netherlands-flagged dredger Vox Maxima hit a stationary Singapore-flagged bunker vessel, Marine Honour, at Pasir Panjang Terminal.\nThe dredger had suffered a sudden loss of engine and steering control.\nThe impact created a rupture in one of the oil tanks of Marine Honour, causing oil to leak into the sea.\nResidents and visitors to the affected areas spoke of a \u201cstrong smell of oil\u201d following the incident."}
