Chinese officials chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries.\nThe Dalai Lama has met U.S. officials, including presidents, during previous visits to the United States, but Biden has not met him since taking office in 2021.\nCrowds of Tibetans, among them school children holding banners, gathered at the airport of the small hill town to greet the visiting lawmakers, while dozens of monks and nuns in maroon robes cheered as they got into vehicles.\n\"Over the last two years the Resolve Tibet Bill was passed ... and it is now on the desk of President Biden, so that will be a game changer,\" said Tenzin Lekshay, spokesperson for the Central Tibetan Administration, or government in exile.
