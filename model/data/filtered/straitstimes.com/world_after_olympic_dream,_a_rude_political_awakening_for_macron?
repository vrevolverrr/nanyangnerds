The French are putting things into perspective and remain very angry with Emmanuel Macron.\u201d\nMr Macron\u2019s approval ratings remain well under 30 per cent, with the President keeping a low profile during the election campaign and the Games, spending most of the Olympics ensconced in the Mediterranean holiday residence of the French president and making only occasional visits to Paris.\n\u201cThe country needed this moment of coming together. In terms of the political impact, I remain very reserved,\u201d one minister from the outgoing government, who asked not to be named, told AFP.\nWhen it comes to the Olympics, \u201cwe cannot make it a partisan success\u201d, added another.\n\u2018Political change\u2019\nThe No. 1 priority for Mr Macron will be naming, and winning approval for, a new prime minister and government, a process that appears to remain as blocked as it was before the Games.\nThe left-wing New Popular Front, which emerged as the largest faction post-election, has said it wants the economist Lucie Castets to be the new premier.\nMr Macron\u2019s forces have shown little interest in the idea, preferring an alliance with the traditional right, with the name of former Chirac-era minister and current head of the northern Hauts de France region, Mr Xavier Bertrand, frequently cited as a candidate to lead a centre-focused coalition.\nOutgoing Equality Minister Aurore Berge named Mr Bertrand as a possible candidate alongside the likes of former EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Senate speaker Gerard Larcher, saying he had \u201csolid experience of government, Parliament and compromise\u201d.\nNaming him would be an \u201caberration\u201d, objected Ms Castets, while Greens leader Marine Tondelier accused Mr Macron of exploiting the political \u201ctruce\u201d he called for the Olympics. \u201cThis Olympic truce is not just because Emmanuel Macron is tired, it is because he wants time\u201d and \u201cto obstruct any attempt at political change\u201d, she said.\n\u2018Still thinking\u2019\nThere had been expectation that Mr Macron could name the new premier in the window between the Olympics, which closed on Aug 11, and the opening of the Paralympics on Aug 28.\nBut as visitors and Parisians gasp in awe for a last time at the Olympic cauldron tethered to a balloon, sources within the executive are playing down the prospects of a rapid breakthrough.\n\u201cIt (the Olympics) will calm things down in the sense that the idea that we work together will be less absurd,\u201d said a senior figure close to Mr Macron, asking not to be named.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not because we went to take selfies in front of the cauldron with half of Paris that we\u2019re suddenly going to form a coalition.\u201d\nMr Macron, known to use his vacations at the Fort de Bregancon residence for deep reading and reflection, is \u201cstill thinking\u201d, according to a person close to him.
