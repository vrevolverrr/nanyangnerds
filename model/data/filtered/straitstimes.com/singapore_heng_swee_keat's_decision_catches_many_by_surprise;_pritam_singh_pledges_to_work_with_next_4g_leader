Like many Singaporeans, we await the forthcoming Cabinet changes, and the 4G PAP leadership's next choice for PM.\"\nMs Nydia Ngiow, senior director of BowerGroupAsia Singapore, which advises companies on government affairs and polices, described Mr Heng as \"a victim of the pandemic\", which she noted had uprooted many best laid plans.\nBut she, as well as other political watchers, believe the timing of the announcement also points to results of the general election last year at play, in which Mr Heng led a team that retained East Coast GRC, though by a lower margin than in the previous election.\nInstitute of Policy Studies deputy director for research Gillian Koh said: \"Any political watcher in Singapore must admit that there were Singaporeans questioning the political future of Mr Heng after the General Election in 2020.\n\"While Mr Heng dismissed any linkage whatsoever between today's announcement and the GE, in the minds of some Singaporeans, they will not be all that surprised by the announcement.\"\nThis was echoed by former PAP MP Inderjit Singh, who said the overall result of the GE, in which the PAP clinched 61.24 per cent of the votes, did not indicate widespread support for Mr Heng's leadership. \"He must have felt the 4G needs more time to gain greater support and time is not on his side,\" he added.\nSome observers saw Mr Heng's move as a testament to the resilience of Singapore's system, adding that it was unlikely to affect political stability and trust in the Government.\nFormer Nominated MP Zulkifli Baharudin and former PAP MP Hong Hai, MP for Kampong Chai Chee from 1989 to 1991, saw it as demonstrating the PAP's ability to adapt to the dynamic nature of the political landscape.\nSaid Mr Zulkifli: \"The party is strong enough to say that if it's time to make a change, it's time to make a change. Whether at an individual or party level, they know at the end of the day that it is the best man and best team that should run the country. It demonstrates the strength of our system.\"\nObservers like Singapore Management University Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan and Dr Koh said having PM Lee remain at the helm in the meantime maintains stability and assurance.\nProf Tan said: It's a setback but it won't affect political stability, trust in the government. I would be worried if we proceeded with plans knowing they are not in the best interests of Singapore and her people.\"\nNational University of Singapore Associate Professor of Sociology Tan Ern Ser said while the change may look on the surface like a \"serious disruption of the succession plan\", the 4G team probably had a ranked order of succession in place all along, and would be able to activate the next plan.\nBut Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior analyst at management consultancy firm Solaris Strategies Singapore, said Singaporeans will understandably be concerned about the development.\nHe added: \"It is incumbent for the Government to provide clarity and certainty on its leadership succession plans.\"\nMeanwhile, Progress Singapore Party secretary-general Francis Yuen said: \"DPM Heng stepping down as the designated successor to the PM in a time of major economic challenges to our country does not augur well for Singapore. We are concerned that it will shake the confidence of Singaporeans and foreign investors.\""}
