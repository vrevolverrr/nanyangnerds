Without it, Palestinian banks would be cut off from the Israeli financial system.\nUS officials have been tight-lipped about what would happen if Israel failed to extend the waiver, and whether they could impose sanctions similar to those slapped on Israeli settlers for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
