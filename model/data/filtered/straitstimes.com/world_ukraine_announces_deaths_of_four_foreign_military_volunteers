Colleagues said he had been killed several days earlier by artillery.\nThe Australian was reported killed in May and his death was confirmed by a foreign affairs department spokesman.\nTasmania's Mercury newspaper identified the man as MR Michael Charles O'Neill, 47. A tribute on Facebook said he was \"driving the wounded and injured from the front line\".\nParis on Friday confirmed that a French volunteer fighter had been killed in combat in Ukraine, following reports that the man died in artillery fire in the Kharkiv region.\nThe official statement on Saturday was accompanied by photographs of the men showing them clad in camouflage and carrying small arms.\nThe organisation says on its website that citizens from countries including Denmark, Israel, Poland, Latvia, Croatia the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Canada have joined their ranks.\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the formation of the force at the start of the war, and Kyiv shortly afterwards said it had received some 20,000 applications.\nThe conflict, now beyond its 100th day, is also said to have drawn in a significant number of volunteer fighters from ex-Soviet state Georgia, which fought a brief and disastrous war with Russia in 2008.\nRussia claimed this week to have killed \"hundreds\" of foreign fighters in Ukraine since its invasion began on Feb 24 and stemmed the flow of newcomers."}
