In 2019, before the pandemic, it flew to 137 destinations.\nAs at Sept 30, the group\u2019s operating fleet comprised 186 passenger aircraft and seven freighters.\nThis includes 131 passenger aircraft and seven freighters in SIA\u2019s fleet, and 55 passenger aircraft in the Scoot fleet. The company has 102 aircraft on order.\nOn Oct 25, SIA said it intends to fully redeem the $3.496 billion mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) \u2013 which were issued in June 2020 \u2013 on Dec 8 this year.\nThe accreted principal amount payable by SIA, being 110.408 per cent of the principal amount of the 2020 MCBs, will be $3.86 billion.\nThe airline group said this will be funded by the existing cash reserves, which have risen in line with the strong recovery in the demand for passenger air travel.\nOn the balance sheet, the group shareholders\u2019 equity stood at $23.2 billion at end-September, an increase of $0.8 billion from March 31.\nCash and bank balances increased by $3.7 billion to $17.5 billion, primarily due to net cash generated from operations, including the proceeds from forward sales.\nIn addition to the cash on hand, the group retains access to $2.2 billion of committed lines of credit, all of which remain undrawn.\nTotal debt balances edged up $0.1 billion to $15.8 billion, mainly due to the increase in lease liabilities as a result of sale-and-leaseback activities. Consequently, SIA group\u2019s debt-equity ratio decreased from 0.70 times to 0.68 times.\nThe company said elevated fuel prices remain a concern in the months ahead. But it added that higher fuel prices are an issue that affects the entire airline industry.\nIn mid-October, SIA confirmed it was in discussions with India\u2019s Tata Group on potential integration of 49-per cent owned Vistara and Tata-controlled Air India. Tata owns the other 51 per cent of Vistara.\nSIA said this was a key part of its \u201cmulti-hub strategy\u201d, which allowed it to directly participate in the growth of one of the largest aviation markets in the world that complements its Singapore hub.\nSIA also has significant partnerships with Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Lufthansa, Malaysia Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, United Airlines, and Virgin Australia.\nGoing forward, SIA expects demand to remain strong heading into the year-end peak travel season.\n\u201cWith the recent relaxation of border controls in parts of East Asia, we expect demand to pick-up in Hong Kong, Taipei, and points in Japan, especially over the holiday period,\u201d it said.\n\u201cForward sales are expected to remain buoyant in the coming months leading up to the Chinese New Year period.\u201d\nBut cargo demand in the third quarter of FY2022/23 is projected to be weaker on a year-on-year basis, as this year\u2019s traditional air cargo peak period is expected to be muted.\nSIA attributed this to the anticipated impact of global economic headwinds on consumer demand, and fewer production orders as importers work on reducing high inventories.\nThe progressive return of industry bellyhold capacity with the resumption of more passenger flights will also put downward pressure on cargo yields, SIA added."}
