It had previously been detected in bats but was found in the lungs of two farmed minks.\nIt is a relative of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mers), which can be deadly to humans.\n\u201cThat we now see that it jumped from bats to farmed mink must serve as an alarm bell,\u201d said Prof Holmes, who is a professor at the University of Sydney. \u201cThis virus needs to be monitored.\u201d\nThousands of unknown viruses are believed to be circulating among wild mammals. Scientists fear that fur farms could allow farmed animals to catch such viruses, which could in turn expose humans.\nThe leading theory for the origin of Covid-19 is that it began in bats, then was transmitted to humans during the trade of wild animals.\n\u201cI strongly believe that the wildlife trade was responsible for the emergence of Sars-CoV-2,\u201d Prof Holmes said.\n\u201cAnd I think that the related fur farming trade could easily result in another pandemic virus,\u201d he added.\nIn the study, the researchers called for increased surveillance of fur farm animals \u2013 particularly for minks, raccoon dogs and guinea pigs, which recorded the most \u201chigh risk\u201d viruses.\nDenmark culled its entire farmed mink population over Covid-19 fears in 2020, but has since reauthorised the practice.
