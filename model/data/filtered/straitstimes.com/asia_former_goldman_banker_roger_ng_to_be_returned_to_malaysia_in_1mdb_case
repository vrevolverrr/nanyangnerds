The lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nNg\u2019s surrender date had been delayed from Sept 6, after US prosecutors said they needed more time to communicate with Kuala Lumpur about first letting him stand trial there.\nA day earlier, Singapore\u2019s central bank banned Ng, also known as Ng Chong Hwa, for life, saying his \u201csevere misconduct\u201d made it \u201ccontrary to public interest to allow him to carry on business as a representative\u201d.\nThe case stemmed from about US$6.5 billion (S$8.9 billion) in bonds that Goldman helped 1MDB sell in 2012 and 2013. US prosecutors said officials, bankers and their associates embezzled about US$4.5 billion of that sum.\nNg is a Malaysian national and Goldman\u2019s former head of investment banking in Malaysia.\nJudge Brodie sentenced Ng in March, 11 months after jurors found him guilty of helping former Goldman boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from 1MDB, launder the proceeds and bribe government officials to win business. Leissner\u2019s much-delayed sentencing is now scheduled for March 19, 2024.\nJho Low, a Malaysian financier and the scheme\u2019s suspected mastermind, was also indicted but remains at large.\nGoldman settled with the authorities in October 2020, agreeing to pay US$2.9 billion and having its Malaysian unit plead guilty to a corruption charge.\nNg had been arrested in Malaysia in November 2018, and agreed to be extradited to the US.
