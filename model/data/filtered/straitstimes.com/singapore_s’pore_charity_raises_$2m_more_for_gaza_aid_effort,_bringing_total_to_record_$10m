According to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, Israel\u2019s ensuing bombardment of the small Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people has killed more than 33,000.\nCountries and humanitarian groups have been providing aid to the Palestinians, with the population on the brink of famine, said a UN-backed report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative. The UN estimated in February 2024 that 300,000 Palestinians are living with little food or clean water.\nSingapore has sent a medical team to Egypt to treat civilian casualties from Gaza, as well as supplies such as medicine, sanitation items and food for civilians. Singapore Red Cross has also sent medical supplies, food and water worth at least $250,000 to civilians in Gaza.\nMr Masagos, who is also Second Minister for Health, told the media he is glad that throughout Ramadan, the Malay-Muslim community worked together tirelessly to improve the lives of the less fortunate in Singapore and overseas.\n\u201cIt is also in the spirit (of compassion and care) that we want Muslims in Singapore to show that mercy and welfare are not only for Muslims or those who live nearby; but also for those beyond our shores,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis generosity and care for those in need is the essence of active citizenry in Singapore society,\u201d he noted, urging all to continue to nurture the spirit of compassion and make contributions to charity beyond the month of Ramadan. He pointed to pioneers and philanthropists such as the late Hajjah Fatimah Sulaiman and Syed Omar Ali Aljunied, who had done much to benefit current and future generations."}
