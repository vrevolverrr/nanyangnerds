He uses a cane or a wheelchair to move around due to a knee ailment, and suffers from repeated bouts of bronchitis and influenza.\nGood Friday leads on Sunday to Easter, the most important and joyous date in the Church\u2019s liturgical calendar - commemorating the day Christians believe Jesus rose from the dead.\nThe Vatican announced the pope\u2019s absence from the \u201cVia Crucis\u201d (Way of the Cross) procession just as it was about to start, saying in a statement he would follow it remotely from his Vatican residence.\nFrancis, who had looked fitter this week after weeks in which he struggled to speak in public and cancelled some meetings, also missed the procession last year, after recovering from a four-day hospital stay for bronchitis.\nFocus on women\nThe Via Crucis at the Colosseum is a re-enactment of Jesus\u2019 death by crucifixion, in which participants take turns in holding the cross as they walk in and around the ancient Roman arena, stopping to pray and hear meditations.\nNuns, priests, a hermit, charity workers, migrants and disabled people were among those who took part in the service, held in a landmark monument believed to have been a place of martyrdom for early Christians.\nFrancis personally wrote the meditations for this year, a first in his 11-year papacy. They included praise for meekness and forgiveness in response to acts of evil, and prayers for persecuted Christians and war victims.\nThe pope, who has called for the Church to become less male-dominated, also hailed the women who helped Jesus while he carried the cross, and pleaded for \u201cthose (women) who in our own day are exploited and endure injustice and indignity\u201d.\nIn another sign of his focus on women, Francis on March 28 performed the foot-washing ritual, which recalls Jesus\u2019 gesture of humility to his apostles at the Last Supper, in a women\u2019s prison in Rome.\nEarlier on March 29, he joined cardinals and bishops for the Passion of the Lord service in St Peter\u2019s Basilica, which featured chants in Latin recounting events from Jesus\u2019 arrest to his burial.\nIn previous years, Francis would start the service prostrating himself on the floor of the basilica, but his frail state no longer allows him to do so. Instead, he arrived in a wheelchair and prayed silently in front of the main altar. REUTERS"}
