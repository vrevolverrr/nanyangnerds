That\u2019s unique in Japan,\u201d said Tesshu Inoue, 75, the head monk, recounting the mythic origins of his temple.\nIn 718 AD, a famous Japanese Buddhist monk and traveller called Gyoki is said to have met the Buddha of medicine, known in Japanese as Yakushi Nyorai, in a dream at the spot where the temple stands today.\nIn his hand, Nyorai held a bunch of grapes \u2013 inspiring Gyoki to found Daizenji and establish the local vineyard culture, teaching Yamanashi residents how to make wine for medicinal purposes.\nA different legend claims farmer Kageyu Amemiya was the first to begin the cultivation of grapes in Japan, in the same area but more than 450 years later, in 1186.\nDNA analysis has found that koshu \u2013 the oldest grape variety grown in the mountainous region \u2013 is a hybrid of a vine species originally cultivated in Europe and a wild Chinese vine.\nThat suggests it may have followed the Silk Road on its way to Japan, the same way Buddhism established itself in Asia.\nThe website for Yamanashi\u2019s \u201ckoshu valley\u201d, supported by the local chamber of commerce, suggests seeds or vines from China may have been planted in the grounds of temples and rediscovered by chance much later.\nHowever, it was only in the Meiji era from 1868 to 1912 \u2013 a period that saw an explosion in interest in the Western world \u2013 that wine production started in Japan.\nWith its fertile soil and long history of grape growing, Yamanashi was the obvious choice for the first vineyards, and even today, Daizenji is surrounded by grapes being grown on pergola structures.\nAt the altar, grapes and bottles sit as offerings, while a small shrine conceals an antique cherry-wood statue of Yakushi Nyorai with his famous bunch of grapes."}
