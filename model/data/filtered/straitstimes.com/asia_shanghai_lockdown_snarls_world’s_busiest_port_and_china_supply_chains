So that\u2019s really enormous.\u201d\nShortages are starting to bite across China\u2019s vast consumer economy, where online shopping platforms such as Taobao face delivery delays, especially of imported goods.\nCovid-19 curbs in a number of cities have forced factories to find new suppliers.\nBut the impact may soon also be felt outside China if lockdowns persist.\nShanghai is the world\u2019s number one container port, a spinal point in the global supply chain and a key gateway for foreign trade.\nIt handles around 17 per cent of China\u2019s total port volume and shipped 47 million TEU \u2013 the standard measurement for cargo, meaning Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit \u2013 in 2021.\nFactories can\u2019t work from home\nChinese manufacturers say lockdowns, no matter how flexible or targeted, pile pressure on their business.\n\u201cNot many roles allow working from home,\u201d said Mr Jason Lee, founder of wheelchair producer Megalicht Tech, whose factory in Shanghai\u2019s Puxi area has suspended production.\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t enter the factory... and because our raw materials come from other provinces or cities, these can\u2019t enter Shanghai either,\u201d he said."}
