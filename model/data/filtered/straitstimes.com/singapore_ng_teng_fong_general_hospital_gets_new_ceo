It is an integrated system overseeing a range of hospitals, national specialty centres, polyclinics, a medical centre, and academic health science institutions.\nAlexandra Hospital, Jurong Community Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and the National University Hospital are all under NUHS.\nProfessor Yeoh Khay Guan, chief executive of NUHS, said: \"I wish to express our deepest appreciation to Mr Foo Hee Jug for his invaluable contribution and leadership. I look forward to (his) continuing contributions in his role as deputy chief executive, (where he will lead) the Group's digital and service transformation to achieve better efficiency and improve patient experience.\"\nHe will continue to oversee the JurongHealth Campus, with the chief executive of NTFGH reporting to him, said Prof Yeoh.\nThe JurongHealth Campus comprises Jurong Community Hospital, Jurong Medical Centre and NTFGH.\nIn 2015, Mr Foo and his team developed and built the 700-bed NTFGH and 400-bed Jurong Community Hospital as Singapore's first integrated healthcare development.\nNTFGH was also the first hospital in Singapore and the whole Asean region to have attained Stage 7 of the HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model, an international standard for utilising and adopting electronic medical record functions.\nDr Quek, who was also a pioneer in building the JurongHealth Campus, played an important role in developing the emergency department at NTFGH.\nHe designed the emergency department and other emergency spaces within the Campus such that they can be rapidly converted in response to a pandemic surge.\nThis allowed the hospital to meet the needs of Covid-19 without impacting the quality of care for other patients.\n\"As the new CEO, Dr Quek will lead the JurongHealth Campus team in the next phase to achieve our aspiration to deliver 'incredible care' across NUHS to every patient, every day,\" said Prof Yeoh."}
