I am for peace and I don\u2019t want to have to shoot. But coming out now is very dangerous, otherwise there would be many more people,\u201d said protester Vasily Fedorov, a student wearing a pacifist symbol on his chest.\n\u201cI came out to the rally planning to participate, but it looks like they\u2019ve already arrested everyone. This regime has condemned itself and is destroying its youth,\u201d said Alexei, a 60-year-old resident who declined to give his last name.\n\u201cWhy are you serving Putin, a man who\u2019s been in power for 20 years!\u201d a young protester shouted at one policeman.\n\u201cI came to say that I am against war and mobilisation,\u201d Oksana Sidorenko, a student, told AFP.\n\u201cWhy are they deciding my future for me? I\u2019m scared for myself, for my brother,\u201d she added.\nAlina Skvortsova, 20, said she hoped Russians would soon understand the nature of the Kremlin\u2019s offensive in neighbouring Ukraine.\n\u201cAs soon as they really understand, they will come out on to the street, despite the fear,\u201d she said."}
