This is very likely due to the resilience built up through vaccination and previous waves of infection\".\nThe large majority of patients continue to report mild symptoms such as sore throat or slight fever, especially if they have been vaccinated, MOH added.\nThere were 11 intensive care unit (ICU) cases and 50 who need oxygen supplementation - a figure MOH said is \"just slightly higher than the level observed in the past few months\".\nIn comparison, at the peak of the previous Delta wave, 171 were warded and 308 needed oxygen supplementation, while during the height of the Omicron wave, 54 were warded in ICU and 242 needed oxygen supplementation."}
