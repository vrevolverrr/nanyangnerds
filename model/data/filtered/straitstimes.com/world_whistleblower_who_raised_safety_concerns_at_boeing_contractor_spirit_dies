A company spokesman said at the time it strongly disagreed with the assertions in the shareholder lawsuit.\nMr Dean had filed a complaint with the Department of Labour alleging his termination was in retaliation for raising safety concerns, according to the Seattle Times.\nBoeing\u2019s safety record and workplace culture are under intense scrutiny after a string of high-profile quality-control problems, including an almost catastrophic mid-air blowout earlier in 2024. No one was injured and the plane landed safely.\nThe incident on an Alaska Airlines flight saw the FAA order a temporary grounding of 171 planes for inspection, while carriers across the globe briefly took their Max 9s out of service.\nThe 737 Max has a troubled history. The jet was grounded by regulators worldwide after deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, which killed the hundreds of passengers on board.\nA 20-month span followed during which lawmakers and others denounced Boeing\u2019s safety culture, leading to billions of dollars in lost sales and other costs.\nThe model\u2019s flight prohibition order was lifted in November 2020 in the US after Boeing made a series of software upgrades and training changes.
