For the 2021-22 business year, the group reported a 2.8 per cent drop in turnover to 736 million euros (S$1,060 million).\nWith the job cuts, the group said it aims to transform into a \u201clean and powerful, internationally well-positioned company\u201d with strong investment in its core brands.\nIt said it would work with labour representatives to minimise the impacts on employees by encouraging early retirement or transfers to other business divisions within the group.\nIn 1958, the company launched the first hula hoop which went on to become a worldwide hit.\nWhen the oil crisis drove up the cost of plastic manufacturing in the 1970s, Brandstaetter asked the company\u2019s master mould-maker Hans Beck to develop a completely new toy system that could be continually expanded.\nBeck came up with the 7.5-centimetre play figures. The initial three models \u2013 a knight, a construction worker and a Native American \u2013 were introduced to the public in 1974.\nToday, the figures range from police and pirates to fairies and clowns.\nDanish competitor Lego said in August that its net profit fell in the first half of the year but its market share grew as sales rose slightly.\nIn contrast to Playmobil, Lego saw three years of record-breaking sales boosted by lockdowns during the Covid pandemic, a feat attributed to the success of its Star Wars and Lego Icons lines.
