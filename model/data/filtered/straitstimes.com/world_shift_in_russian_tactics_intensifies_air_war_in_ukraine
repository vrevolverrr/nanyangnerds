It is dangerous for them to send their fighter jets close to the front line, he added, but it can \u201cimpact Ukrainian positions effectively\u201d.\nThe Ukrainian army last week said it had shot down seven Su-34 fighter jets, nearly all operating in the east, just a few days after downing an A-50 long-range radar reconnaissance aircraft.\nIt was, according to Ukrainian officials, part of a series of successful strikes against the Russian air force, in which Ukraine claimed to have shot down 15 planes in as many days.\nThe majority of the shootdowns could not be independently verified, and a senior US official expressed scepticism at that number.\nThe official said the Ukrainians appear to be taking credit in some instances for planes they fired at, but which were not confirmed to have been downed.\nOryx, a military analysis site that counts losses based on visual evidence, and Russian military bloggers confirmed the loss of two Su-35 fighter jets. Britain\u2019s military intelligence services confirmed the destruction of the A-50 plane.\nMr Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defence Project at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the Russian losses probably were the result of \u201csome relationship between the Russian aircraft being put in harm\u2019s way\u201d, Ukraine\u2019s intelligence gathering on the movements of Russian planes and the deployment of air-defence systems \u201cto take them out\u201d.\nAfter the invasion in February 2022, Ukraine managed to keep Russia from controlling the skies through air combat and the skilful use of anti-aircraft missiles.\nAfter only a month and heavy losses among its warplanes, Russia stopped flying its aircraft beyond the front lines, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said in a report, turning instead to launching barrages of cruise and ballistic missiles from afar.\nBut that left Russia \u201cunable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower\u201d of its fighter bombers to strike Ukrainian front-line positions, the report said.\nThis began to change in early 2023 when Russia started using glide bombs, guided munitions that are dropped from a plane and can fly long distances to the front lines, limiting the risk to planes from anti-aircraft missiles.\nCarrying hundreds of kilograms of explosives, the glide bombs can smash through the underground bunkers that protect soldiers at the front.\n\u201cThese bombs completely destroy any position,\u201d Mr Egor Sugar, a Ukrainian soldier who fought in Avdiivka, wrote on social media. \u201cAll buildings and structures simply turn into a pit after the arrival of just one.\u201d\nUkrainian officials and military analysts said Russian aviation had played an important role in the capture of Avdiivka, one that required Russian jets \u201cto fly closer\u201d to the front line to maximise the effect of the glide bombs.\nAnd that exposed them to the risk of being shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defences.\nIn late December, the Ukrainian army said it destroyed three Su-34 jets near the Russian-controlled eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the south, where Ukrainian troops have secured small positions. Then came the shootdowns in the east.\nIt remains unclear which air-defence systems Ukraine has deployed. But some army officials and analysts have hinted at the use of the US-made Patriot, America\u2019s most advanced ground-based air-defence system.\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think-tank, said \u201cRussian forces appeared to tolerate an increased rate of aviation losses in recent weeks in order to conduct glide-bomb strikes in support of ongoing Russian offensive operations in eastern Ukraine\u201d.\nOne of Ukraine\u2019s biggest successes in the air battle was the destruction last week of one of Russia\u2019s A-50 radar planes \u2013 the second in 2024 \u2013 which are critical in coordinating aerial bombardments of Ukrainian positions on the front.\n\u201cTaking out their eyes, and taking out their targeting ability, that\u2019s a pretty good win,\u201d Mr Karako said.\nBritain\u2019s military intelligence said Russia had seven other A-50s but that it had \u201chighly likely grounded the fleet from flying\u201d in support of its military operations to prevent further losses, thus reducing the \u201csituational awareness provided to air crews\u201d.\nThe Ukrainian air force said Russian aviation activity in eastern Ukraine had significantly subsided by the evening of March 2.\nIt is unclear how long Russia can sustain air losses. Rusi analysts said in February that Russian air crew losses amounted to nearly 160 personnel, which they described as \u201ca serious loss of capability\u201d.\nThe Russian state news agency Tass said on February 27 that the state-owned defence conglomerate, Rostec, would resume production of the A-50 \u201csince it is needed by the Russian armed forces\u201d.\nMr Hrabskyi likened Russia\u2019s costly strategy in the air to its tactics on the ground, where it has sent wave after wave of troops in bloody assaults to capture cities, regardless of the human cost.\n\u201cThe Russians don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have an order, they will use all available capabilities, all available weapons systems to attack.\u201d NYTIMES"}
