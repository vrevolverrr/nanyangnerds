What are the economic costs and environmental impact, and will small businesses hit in the pocket be given help?\nThese were among the questions uppermost on MPs\u2019 minds during the Parliament sitting on July 2, as government leaders helming the response to the spill at Pasir Panjang Terminal delivered ministerial statements.\nTransport Minister Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, and National Development Minister Desmond Lee responded to 40 questions on the incident, filed by 23 MPs from both sides of the political aisle.\nThese ran the gamut. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked about the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for containing spills, while other MPs \u2013 including Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) and Mr Edward Chia (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) \u2013 wanted to know the estimated costs of the cleanup.\nThe high-level attention being paid to the issue was borne out not just by the one hour and 40 minutes of airtime it was given in the House.\nEight days before the parliamentary debate, the same three Cabinet ministers spent slightly more than an hour and 10 minutes at a press conference sketching out Singapore\u2019s cleanup efforts.\nOn June 14, at 2.18pm, a Netherlands-flagged vessel, Vox Maxima, lost engine and steering controls, hitting a Singapore-flagged bunker vessel, Marine Honour, which was berthed at Pasir Panjang Terminal.\nThe next day, the oil that escaped from Marine Honour had washed ashore in areas such as Sentosa and East Coast Park.\nThe response to the spill \u2013 in particular the time it took to lay containment booms around the damaged bunker vessel \u2013 came under scrutiny again in Parliament on July 2.\nIt took a contractor nearly 15 hours to complete the deployment of the booms, hampered by a thunderstorm and nightfall.\nWorkers\u2019 Party (WP) MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) asked about Singapore\u2019s required response times to oil spills of varying severity.\nIn response, Mr Chee said it was \u201cdifficult to have a precise, single number\u201d because \u201cevery oil spill is different\u201d.\nThe scale of the spill, the area\u2019s geography and oil density play a part.\n\u201cIn some instances, the oil may not float very far away. In some instances, it may float farther away.\n\u201cIn some instances... the oil density makes it easier to detect because it floats on the surface. In this case, it was an added challenge because this oil has (a) similar density (to) seawater, so it could go below the surface.\u201d\nFor these reasons, \u201cthere isn\u2019t a single number that you can say, Oh, did you meet this (number of) hours?\u201d, the Transport Minister said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite like that.\u201d\nAt several points in Parliament \u2013 as he did at the press conference \u2013 Mr Chee stressed that the authorities and their contractors followed international industry practices to contain the spill.\nIn the first instance, dispersant was sprayed to break down the spilled oil, to pave the way for cleanup efforts.\nBooms were then laid around the damaged vessel.\nContractor T&T Salvage Asia fully deployed 200m of booms at 5.15am on June 15. The contractor needed more time as it had to load its vessel with heavy equipment and set about the laborious task of laying the booms amid bad weather and nightfall.\nMr Chee said T&T did its best given the circumstances, and its response time was in line with industry practices internationally.\nHe explained that currents and waves would have carried the spilled oil away from the accident site, and hence, the booms were not meant to ring-fence the oil that has already leaked.\nRather, they were to prevent further spills from the vessel, which still had vast amounts of fuel in its tanks.\nWP MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) rose twice to ask if the booms could have been deployed more quickly.\nMr Chee replied that the practices used in response to the oil spill have been developed over the years by experts, and \u201cthis is how it is done internationally, not just in Singapore but also in other parts of the world\u201d.\nWhile the minister said \u201cthere is no disagreement that faster is better\u201d, he made the point that even in the best circumstances, there will be a gap between a large oil spill and when booms are fully deployed.\nWhat, then, is the most effective tool against large oil patches? Skimmers that lift oil from the water surface into storage tanks.\nIn this case, the challenge for the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and its contractors was in locating those patches \u2013 an effort also hampered by poor visibility and nightfall.\nThey were able to do so only on the morning after the spill, when the skimmers were dispatched, Mr Chee disclosed on July 2.\nAnother question was whether it made economic sense to have in-house capacity to contain oil spills, instead of engaging contractors.\nMr Chee said the MPA has in-house capabilities, such as vessels, for this purpose.\nBut, given the nature of spills, Mr Chee said the Republic wants to tackle them in two ways:\nFostering \u201cgood collaborations\u201d with its neighbours to ensure a coordinated response during spills; and\nWorking with contractors who are experts in various areas, including laying booms and skimming oil.\nCautioning against a binary view that \u201ceverything has to be in-house, or everything has to be outsourced\u201d, he said: \u201cWe need both.\u201d\nOne key takeaway from the debate was that it takes all hands on deck to contain an oil spill. It is impossible for the authorities to go it alone.\nAside from response times and SOPs, it was heartening to hear other MPs asking after the well-being of the cleaners driving the cleanup, who toil largely unseen.\nFor instance, Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) wanted to know if measures were in place to ensure cleaners get ample rest, while WP MP He Tingru (Sengkang GRC) asked if workers and volunteers had reported health concerns.\nResponding, Ms Fu said workers whom she spoke to said they were being given time to rest and hydrate. There has not been feedback on workers or volunteers suffering from the ill effects of oil inhalation.\nThe timeliness of the Government\u2019s communications on the spill was also a point of discussion.\nMr Chee said the MPA and other agencies issued five media statements in the first four days.\nMPA had first alerted the public to the spill at about 6pm on June 14 via a statement, after the incident happened at 2.18pm. The authority said some oil from Marine Honour\u2019s damaged tank had spilled into the water, but \u201cthe affected cargo tank has been isolated and the spill contained\u201d.\nWhile the authorities must be lauded for the regular updates in the days after the spill, some have suggested that more information could have been provided on the potential spread of oil to the beaches the day after.\nAs the cleanup moves into the next phase targeting hard-to-reach areas, attention is shifting towards the spill\u2019s impact on biodiversity.\nMr Lee said the authorities will, for instance, undertake scientific research with scientists, to better understand the spill\u2019s longer-term impact."}
