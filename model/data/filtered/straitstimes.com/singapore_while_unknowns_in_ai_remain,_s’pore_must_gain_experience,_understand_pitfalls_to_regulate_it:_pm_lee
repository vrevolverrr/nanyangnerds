But would it progress all the way to the point of having a conversation, said PM Lee.\nHe added: \u201cEither the chatbot can interview me, or I may interview the chatbot\u2026 Or two chatbots may be talking to each other better than us.\u201d\nPerhaps putting in 10 times more chips or 10 times more effort in computing, AI could reach that level, or it could also reach a limit, he said.\n\u201cThen you need another breakthrough conceptually, to take it to the next level where it\u2019s got insight, understanding, judgment, reasoning and empathy,\u201d said PM Lee.\nIn principle, there is no reason why a machine that can think, act, speak and look like it feels like a human being cannot be built, he added.\n\u201cSome philosophers think it\u2019s not possible. I don\u2019t believe that. I think it is possible but I don\u2019t know how long it will take,\u201d he said.\nBut when that happens, there will be some profound questions thrown up that are difficult to answer, he added."}
