But on Friday, she said that under the law she is required to impose the penalty, and the amount \u201cis not constitutionally excessive\u201d.\nMr Agnifilo said: \u201cWe are appealing several issues, including the court\u2019s recent forfeiture ruling. Nothing has shaken our belief in Mr Ng\u2019s innocence and we will fight this as long as necessary.\u201d\nNg, a 51-year-old Malaysian, was convicted of conspiring to violate US anti-bribery laws and taking part in a money-laundering scheme.\nHis former Goldman boss and 1MDB co-conspirator, Tim Leissner, previously pleaded guilty and was the government\u2019s star witness against Ng. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September.\nOn March 3, Judge Brodie ordered Leissner to forfeit US$43.7 million in cash and 3.3 million shares, valued at US$300 million as at Friday, in fitness drink company Celsius Holdings.\nWhile Ng argued that he was less culpable than Leissner or Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who the US said masterminded the fraud, Judge Brodie rejected his arguments, saying he \u201cwilfully engaged\u201d in the multibillion-dollar scheme.\n\u201cEven if Ng is less responsible than the others charged with similar offences, he played a role in one of the largest financial crimes of all time,\u201d she said in her ruling.\n\u201cThe scheme resulted in enormous tangible harm, the theft of US$3 billion, and intangible harm to the confidence in democracy and government.\u201d\nMr Agnifilo had argued that the Malaysian authorities had seized all of Ng\u2019s assets and accounts and those of his family members before he was arrested on US charges in late 2018.\nJudge Brodie turned down that argument.\n\u201cNg has failed to show that forfeiture would destroy his future livelihood,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThe fact that he already paid a large sum to the Malaysian government does not, on its own, render the forfeiture amount constitutionally excessive.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
