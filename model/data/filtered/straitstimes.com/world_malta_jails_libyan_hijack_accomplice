They landed in Malta instead because of a lack of fuel.\nThe hijackers had threatened to blow up the plane, but their weapons later turned out to be fake and the 109 passengers were released unharmed. The hijackers' demands were never made clear.\nThe hijack mastermind, Soko Moussa Shaha Ali, was jailed for 25 years in 2020.\nIn sentencing Saleh, the court said it had taken into account the fact that he had pleaded guilty, that the passengers were released quickly and unharmed, and that he was not the mastermind of the hijacking.
