Portions of the waterway, where US$3 trillion (S$3.9 trillion) worth of trade passes annually, are believed to be rich in oil and natural gas deposits, as well as fish stocks.\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 found China\u2019s sweeping claims had no legal basis, a ruling Beijing rejects.\nIn June, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Philippines\u2019 security, after Manila accused China of a \u201cdeliberate action\u201d to stop the resupply of Philippine troops stationed at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal."}
