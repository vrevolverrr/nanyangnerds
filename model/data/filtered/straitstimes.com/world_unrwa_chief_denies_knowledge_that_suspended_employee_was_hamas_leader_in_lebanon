He was suspended from his job at UNRWA in March following allegations concerning his politics, Philippe Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva.\n\u201cI never heard the word commander before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s obvious for you today, was not obvious yesterday.\u201d\nLazzarini, who briefed press after meeting with UN member states earlier on Sept 30, said he asked them to \u201cpush back on all the reputation attack on the agency and the ongoing drafting of bills which could be adopted in Jerusalem.\u201d\nHe was referring to a move by Israeli parliament to declare the organisation a \u201cterrorist body\u201d which has already received preliminary approval. Such a move would be \u201cabsolutely unconscionable\u201d, he added.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has for years called for UNRWA to be dismantled, accusing it of anti-Israeli incitement.\nUNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) was established in 1949 and provides relief to Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, including in Lebanon where it says up to 250,000 reside."}
