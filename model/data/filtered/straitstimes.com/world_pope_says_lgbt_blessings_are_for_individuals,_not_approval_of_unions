He first did so in an Italian television interview on Jan. 14\nHis latest comments were in an address to members of the Vatican's doctrinal department. Its head, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, has given a spate of interviews to clarify the intent of the document, known by its Latin title Fiducia Supplicans (Supplicating Trust).\nThe intentions of the blessings, Francis said were \"to concretely show the closeness of the Lord and the Church to all those who, finding themselves in different situations, ask for help to continue - sometimes to begin - a journey of faith.\"\nThe Church teaches that gay sex is sinful and disordered and that people with same-sex attractions, which are not considered sinful, should try to be chaste.\nThe pope said that while \"moral perfection\" was not required of people seeking such blessings, they were not intended to justify a relationship the Church considers irregular.\n\"When a couple comes forward spontaneously to ask for them, one does not bless the union, but simply the people who together\nhave requested it. Not the union, but the persons,\" Francis said.\nFrancis stressed that such blessings should not be given in a liturgical context. The document says they should be delivered discreetly and never with any of the pomp or ceremonial accoutrements found at weddings.\nSince his election in 2013, Francis has tried to make the Church, with its 1.35 billion members, more welcoming to LGBT people, without changing moral doctrine.\nIn his Friday address, Francis appeared to acknowledge the pushback the document unleashed, particularly in Africa, where bishops have effectively rejected it and where in some countries same-sex activity can lead to prison or even the death penalty.\nFrancis said that when the blessings are given, priests should \"naturally take into account the context, the sensitivities, the places where one lives and the most appropriate ways to do it\".
