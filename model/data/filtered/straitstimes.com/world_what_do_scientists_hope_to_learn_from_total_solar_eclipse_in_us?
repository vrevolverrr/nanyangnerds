They move people to feel a kind of reverence for the beauty of our universe,\u201d Nasa administrator Bill Nelson told reporters.\nResearchers studied this feeling of awe in 2017, using data from nearly three million users on Twitter, now called X.\nThose in the so-called \u201cpath of totality\u201d, under which the Moon will fully block out the Sun, tended to use the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d (as opposed to \u201cI\u201d) and express concern about other people, according to psychology professor Paul Piff from the University of California, Irvine.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that experiences that bring about awe... seem to attune people and connect us to one another, to connect us to entities that are larger than ourselves,\u201d Prof Piff said.\nIn 2024, he plans to study if the experience has any effect on political divisions in society."}
