What if the 14-year-old teen had taken a knife and went to an MRT station to kill people?\n\u201cThis is something parents need to think about. Love for their children is actually reporting them. They can\u2019t just leave their children be in such a situation.\u201d\nMr Abdul Halim Kader, president of Taman Bacaan, or the Singapore Malay Youth Library Association, said many parents are afraid of reporting their children.\nHe said: \u201cHaving spoken to some of the families of radicalised youth, we have to do more in educating them about coming forward.\n\u201cWe have to explain to them not to worry, the authorities are not going to put your child underground just because you reported them. Instead, they will be educated, counselled and rehabilitated.\u201d\nHe likened it to reporting one\u2019s child for drug addiction in the 80s, when most parents thought it would permanently ruin their lives.\nHe said: \u201cBut over time, we helped them understand that reporting gets their child the help needed to turn their lives around. And now, many parents will report their child to seek help for drugs. I think we can learn from this.\u201d\nMr Abdul Halim added that to reach out to parents, Taman Bacaan is considering initiatives on different platforms, including TikTok, podcasts and streaming services.\nOn July 17, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the West\u2019s role in the Gaza conflict has incensed the young in many countries around the world, not just Muslims.\nIt also risks radicalising another generation of would-be terrorists in Gaza and elsewhere, said the minister.\nAt the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado in the US, Dr Ng was asked about the mood among Muslims in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia in relation to the West\u2019s role in the conflict.\nHe used one word to describe the mood \u2013 \u201canger\u201d. He noted that the anger was not confined to only Muslims, but also prevalent among young people in many countries, including Singapore, who are particularly incensed about the violence and the fact that nothing seems to be done to stop it.\nDr Ng said the anger among the young towards the situation in the Middle East is difficult for countries to address, whether they have Muslim populations or not.\nSince 2015, ISD has dealt with 13 radicalised people aged 20 and below under the ISA.\nNational University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser, who is also adjunct principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies Social Lab, has spoken to several detainees.\nHe said it can be quite easy for young people to get views online relating to issues they are concerned about, which will eventually lead them down some radical \u201crabbit holes\u201d.\nDr Tan said: \u201cThis could serve to awaken the seed of radical views already present in them and, in turn, reinforce and strengthen those views, if left unchecked.\u201d\nHe said family members and friends who radicalised youth trust and respect have a role to play in helping them think through issues and nudge them towards accepting that there could be solutions other than terrorism.\nDr Tan added: \u201cI gather that for those deep into radical views, it would require the knowledge and wisdom of respected religious teachers over a long period of time to convince them about their errors, for which they may already have invested much time, effort and money.\u201d\nUstaz Mohamed said as violence around the world continues, there will still be the possibility of young people here being radicalised.\nHe said: \u201cWe can\u2019t stop foreign violence from happening. We can\u2019t immediately stop what is happening in the Middle East.\n\u201cBut what we can do is help our young people navigate their emotions, on how to respond in the Singaporean context.\u201d"}
