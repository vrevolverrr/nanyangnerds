It is what it is. I am not a scientist, but the pictures speak the truth.\u201d\nThe expedition veteran further warned that the temperature of the Antarctic has increased by 3 deg C over the last 50 years \u2013 much higher than the global average temperature rise of 1.2 deg C.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that you can go to the Antarctic and wear T-shirts in January or February,\u201d he added.\nThe showcase of ACE findings is part of a wider climate action exhibition put together by the National Parks Board (NParks), City Developments Limited (CDL) and Ocean Geographic.\nIt was launched on Friday by Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Indranee Rajah, alongside NParks chief executive Hwang Yu-Ning and CDL group chief operating officer Kwek Eik Sheng.\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Ms Indranee, who is also Second Minister for National Development and Finance, said the exhibition \u201ctakes visitors on a captivating journey to the Antarctic, where the impacts of climate change, rising temperatures and melting glaciers threaten the well-being of life across the globe\u201d.\nEntitled Melting Ice, Sinking Cities, the exhibition is housed at the refurbished net-zero energy CDL Green Gallery and will run until March 2024.\nThe exhibition features five zones, including displays of NParks\u2019 marine conservation efforts to enhance coastal resilience in Singapore and CDL\u2019s initiatives to reduce carbon emissions in its buildings.\nSaid Mr Kwek: \u201cIt is our wish that you, our guests, and all visitors from all parts of the world will leave the exhibition feeling empowered and inspired to effect change in their everyday lives, and that no act is too small.\u201d"}
