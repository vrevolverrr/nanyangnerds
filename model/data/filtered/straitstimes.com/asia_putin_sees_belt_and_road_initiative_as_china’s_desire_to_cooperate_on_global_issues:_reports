They only provide opportunities\u201d, he was quoted by Chinese state television as saying in Moscow.\n\u201cThis is the difference between President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and other projects pursued by countries with a colonialist flavour,\u201d Mr Putin was quoted as saying.\nHe also said the BRI was timely and is developing well, according to RIA.\nMr Putin is due to attend the third Belt and Road Forum, which will be held in Beijing from Tuesday to Wednesday.\nHe attended the two previous forums, in 2017 and 2019.\nThe BRI is a plan for global infrastructure and energy networks that China launched a decade ago to connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime routes.
