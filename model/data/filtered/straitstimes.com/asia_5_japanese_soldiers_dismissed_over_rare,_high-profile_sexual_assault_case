Two others then did the same.\nMs Gonoi reported the incident to an army sexual harassment counsellor and the case was investigated and sent to prosecutors on suspicion of indecent assault.\nBut the case was dropped on grounds of insufficient evidence earlier in 2022.\nMs Gonoi was recently chosen as one of the Financial Times\u2019 25 most influential women of 2022.
