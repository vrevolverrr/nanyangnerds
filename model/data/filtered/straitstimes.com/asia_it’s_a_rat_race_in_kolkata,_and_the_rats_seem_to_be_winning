But on Esplanade Row, the street next to the legislative building, humans have been waging \u2013 and seemingly losing \u2013 a battle that rages on a daily basis against a wily subterranean opponent.\nIn the daytime, people assert their authority on the street. They honk their cars to get through a maze of parked vehicles and pedestrians in the colonial-era neighbourhood dotted with 19th century neogothic buildings.\nLawyers, officious in their cloaks, pour out of the adjacent Calcutta High Court building and saunter through narrow pavements lined with busy food stalls.\nBut come night, when the cacophony dies down in this office district, an army of rodents \u2013 possibly hundreds or thousands of them \u2013 emerge from their underground bunkers and stake claim over the neighbourhood.\nThey loosen the earth under them, making footpaths cave in. They chew on underground cables, disrupting power supply. Not only that, they even upend record-keeping, gnawing through documents in the assembly building.\nLess privileged people who sleep on pavements at night are in their cross hairs too, with the pesky rats nibbling at their limbs and ears. Even patients \u2013 both dead and alive \u2013 in the city\u2019s hospitals have not been spared in a few cases.\nKolkata, once the second-largest city in the British empire and which commanded authority as far as Singapore, is today struggling to get a grip on a rodent problem.\nThe city\u2019s leading English daily, The Telegraph, dedicated an editorial to this crisis on Oct 8, describing how rats were \u201cnibbling away at the city\u2019s foundations\u201d as if they were \u201can army of ravenous locusts\u201d.\nFlyovers, roads, pavements and old buildings in several parts of the city are under threat as rats burrow through the ground under them and weaken their bases.\nKolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim told The Indian Express that rats are a \u201cmajor problem\u201d and blamed \u201cillegal squatters\u201d and \u201croadside eateries that throw waste food on the road\u201d for them.\nEnvironmentalists have attributed the surge in the population of rodents to unplanned urbanisation as the Kolkata Metropolitan Area, already home to more than 14 million people, struggles to find space for new residents.\nHigh-rise buildings and other residential units have expanded into natural habitats that once housed rats\u2019 predators such as owls, kites and jackals.\nThe Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has in recent years had to reinforce damaged structures and fill up holes on footpaths, roads and walls of bridges with a mix of concrete, sand and glass shards to restrict the mobility of rats.\nThis is something Mr Nepal Pal had to do as well to stabilise his tea stall under the Dhakuria flyover in south Kolkata.\n\u201cMy store was caving in,\u201d said the 37-year-old, who dug up the ground beneath his stall earlier this year and replaced the soil with the mixture.\nThe four-lane Dhakuria flyover, built in the 1960s, is one of several structures in the city that has weakened over the years as rats burrowed large holes through the earth underneath its approach ramps.\nThe rats continue to pester Mr Pal as they creep into his stall and chew through plastic jars that he uses to stock biscuits and cakes.\n\u201cI lose 30 to 40 rupees (50 to 65 Singapore cents) daily,\u201d he told The Straits Times, holding out three packets of cake that had been nibbled at by rats.\nHe is gradually replacing the plastic jars with more expensive glass ones that come with steel lids.\nBack at Esplanade Row, Mr Kundan Kumar, a roadside food stall vendor, faces a similar struggle to protect his supplies.\n\u201cThey tear into our potato sacks and eat the potatoes. They eat our wheat flour... They don\u2019t even let us sleep here at nights. They come from here, they come from there,\u201d he said.\nAs he served a customer rotis (Indian flatbread) along with dal and spiced chickpea curry, a rat helped itself to some dough stuck to the exterior of his large tin drum tandoor.\nMr Kumar has been fortunate enough not to get bitten, but Mr Subodh Kumar Shaw, who helps out at another stall and also spends the night on the pavement, has not been as lucky.\nHe has been bitten twice, including on his right ear as recently as six months ago.\n\u201cIf you throw a handful of rice here at night, 50 to 60 rats will gather to eat it,\u201d the 26-year-old said, gesturing to a spot alongside the pavement that was pockmarked with a few large holes created by rodents.\nNearby, plates from the stalls with leftover food were piled on the ground \u2013 easy pickings for rats that scurried in and out of their holes.\nThe authorities in Kolkata have conducted awareness campaigns on waste disposal, but bringing about behavioural change among residents remains a tall order.\nThe rodent species that have unleashed havoc in Kolkata include the small common house mice and the greater bandicoot that can grow as big as 30cm, not including the tail.\nA rodent onslaught, however, is not just Kolkata\u2019s bane; even better managed and affluent Western cities such as New York, Paris and London have struggled with them.\nWhile the problem is nowhere near as apocalyptic as in Albert Camus\u2019 novel The Plague, Kolkata Deputy Mayor Atin Ghosh told ST the issue is \u201cdefinitely a matter of concern\u201d.\nHe said that the KMC had reached out to its counterpart in Mumbai for an effective solution to exterminate the rats, but failed to find any.\nPoisoning them en masse can lead to unintended results such as spreading the poison to other animals that feed on rats.\n\u201cOur experts are always searching all over the world for ways to control the population of rats, but we are not getting any solution from others,\u201d he added."}
