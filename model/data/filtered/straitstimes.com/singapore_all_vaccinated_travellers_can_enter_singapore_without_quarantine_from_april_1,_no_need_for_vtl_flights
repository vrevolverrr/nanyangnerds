Iswaran said at a press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 that there will be several other changes with the reopening to all vaccinated travellers.\nAir crew can resume normal activities in Singapore or overseas. They will be subject to similar testing requirements as vaccinated travellers.\nAirport workers only need to put on surgical masks, except for those in higher-risk roles who will be required to wear a face shield and gloves. They will no longer be required to undergo regular Covid-19 testings.\nThe airport will no longer be segregated into zones, thus allowing all travellers to move around freely in the transit area.\nBut Mr Iswaran cautioned that Singapore must be prepared to quickly re-establish public health protocols if the Covid-19 situation changes suddenly.\nHe added: \u201cThis shift to the Vaccinated Travel Framework is a decisive step for Singapore and an important signal to the world \u2013 that Singapore has fully reopened its borders, that we are reconnecting with the world, and reclaiming Changi\u2019s status as an international aviation hub.\u201d\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a televised speech on Thursday morning that the move to reopen to vaccinated travellers will give a much-needed boost to businesses, particularly those in the tourism sector, and help Singapore reclaim its position as a business and aviation hub.\nThe Government had earlier announced a target to restore air travel to 50 per cent of the levels before the Covid-19 pandemic this year.\nThe total number of passenger movements through Changi in February this year was 13.7 per cent of the levels in February 2019 prior to the pandemic.\nMOH on Thursday also updated its policy for billing travellers infected with Covid-19 for treatment, with immediate effect.\nUnder the old system, Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders were required to pay for Covid-19 treatment at hospitals and Covid-19 treatment and recovery facilities, if they tested positive for Covid-19 within 14 days of their return to Singapore.\nBut this policy has now been changed, with the new Vaccinated Travel Framework, said MOH.\nThe International Air Transport Association (Iata) regional vice-president for Asia-Pacific Philip Goh said the reopening will enable airlines to ramp up their services. He added that the removal of pre-departure testing in time to come will also boost the aviation sector\u2019s journey towards a full recovery.\n\u201cWe have seen other significant moves in the region to reopen borders recently, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam,\u201d said Mr Goh.\n\u201cThis means many key markets in Asia will become more accessible to each other, restoring crucial air connectivity to the rest of the world.\u201d\nRead next: What you need to know about Singapore's latest Covid-19 rules"}
