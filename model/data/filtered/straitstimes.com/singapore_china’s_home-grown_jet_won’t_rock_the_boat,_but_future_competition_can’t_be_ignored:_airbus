So I expect to see more of it, not less,\u201d he said.\nAs for Airbus, Mr Scherer said the Asia-Pacific region is important for the firm, making up about a third of its business activity.\nHe added that demand for passenger and cargo aircraft in the region will continue to grow.\n\u201cWe see no reason for it to slow down,\u201d he said.\nOn Singapore specifically, Mr Scherer said Airbus will continue to invest here, especially when it comes to sustainability.\nOn Feb 20, the company signed an agreement with the Economic Development Board to facilitate the establishment of a Sustainable Aviation Hub, which will be hosted on the Airbus Singapore Campus in Seletar Aerospace Park and focus on technology, research and innovation.\nMr Scherer said the Republic is fertile ground for developing sustainable solutions, and Airbus already has some initiatives here with local players.\nThese include a study on the feasibility of using hydrogen as an alternative aviation fuel announced in 2022, which he said is going well.\nGiving his reaction to Singapore\u2019s aviation sustainability plan announced on Feb 19, Mr Scherer said the Government has been one of the strongest endorsers of decarbonisation and Airbus welcomes this.\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely determined to play a pivotal role in the transition of this industry towards decarbonised flying. We view it as our social mission, beyond even our commercial mission, and we put our money where our mouth is.\u201d"}
