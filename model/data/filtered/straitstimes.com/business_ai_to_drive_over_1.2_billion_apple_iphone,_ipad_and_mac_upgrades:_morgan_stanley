Shares hit their first record high of 2024 following the reveal.\nShares in Apple rose 1.7 per cent to close at US$234.40 on July 15 Through its July 12 close, the shares had risen 17 per cent since the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, outpacing the Nasdaq 100 Index\u2019s 7 per cent gain over the same period.\n\u201cWe believe that there is a record level of pent-up demand entering the iPhone 16 cycle later this year,\u201d wrote Mr Woodring, who has an overweight rating on the stock. \u201cComing out of the Worldwide Developers Conference \u2013 where Apple debuted Apple Intelligence \u2013 we have even greater conviction that financial year 2025 could be the start of a multi-year device refresh cycle.\u201d\nApple Intelligence will \u201cdeliver much improved, and unique to the Apple ecosystem utility value\u201d for more than 1.3 billion users, Mr Woodring said, adding that it will force device upgrades and accelerate product replacement cycles \u2013 a key catalyst that has historically driven Apple stock outperformance.\nOnly 15 per cent Apple\u2019s total installed user base will be able to support Apple Intelligence because the technology will be limited to devices using A17 Pro and M-Series chips, Mr Woodring said.\nWhile a majority of Mac users will be able to use it, just 8 per cent of current iPhone and iPad users will be able to power the AI platform.\nUnder the analyst\u2019s estimates, more than 1.2 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs will need to be upgraded.\nInitial adoption of Apple Intelligence will be limited to US English iPhone users when it launches this autumn.\nStill, Mr Woodring sees factors such as the broadening of non-English functionality adding even more value to users over the next 12 to 24 months.\nIn Mr Woodring\u2019s view, it sets Apple up for a return to year-over-year unit growth in financial year 2025, followed by a potential for a major cycle in financial year 2026.\nApple\u2019s annual sales in India hit a record of nearly US$8 billion (S$10.75 billion), Bloomberg News reported on July 15, underscoring a rapidly growing market where the iPhone maker now assembles more of its devices and operates two flagship stores.
