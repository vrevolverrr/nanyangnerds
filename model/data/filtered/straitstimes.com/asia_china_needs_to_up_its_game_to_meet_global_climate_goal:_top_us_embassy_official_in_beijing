(But) we are not where we need to be. No countries are where we need to be,\" said Mr David Meale, charge d'affaires at the American Embassy in Beijing. President Joe Biden's nominee for ambassador, career diplomat Nicholas Burns, has not been cleared by the US Senate for his appointment.\nSaid Mr Meale: \"The 1.5 deg C goal that the world is working towards is in danger. And if we're going to get to where we need to go, we're going to have to keep raising our ambition, keep taking new steps, and nowhere is that going to be more important than what China does.\"\nChina is the world's largest polluter, accounting for 27 per cent of total global emissions.\nWhile President Xi Jinping has vowed to control the country's coal-fired power plants and phase down coal consumption, it has in recent months hiked production to ease a power crisis and prepare for the winter months.\nThe highly polluting energy source fuels nearly 60 per cent of the country.\nBut US officials say they do not see this as a step back.\n\"While there are increases in coal production, there is also equal effort to find alternatives. And we're hopeful,\" said Ms Forest Yang, the environment counsellor at the embassy.\nA combination of hydro, nuclear and other renewables is expected to make up a quarter of China's primary energy demand by the end of this decade.\nEven so, China has continued to build coal-fired power plants domestically, as well as overseas for which contracts have already been signed.\nIn a September address to the United Nations, President Xi promised not to build new plants abroad, but Beijing has so far not provided details on this particular commitment, such as on the financing of these projects.\nMr Meale said that the US and China's climate envoys John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua have met three times, spoken dozens of times and developed \"a very collaborative relationship\".\nBut there is an \"extraordinary need for engagement, exchange of expertise, collaborative thinking, to ask ourselves: How can China step up its ambition and step up its timeline, so that we can rescue the 1.5 goal\", said Mr Meale, who was speaking to reporters as the embassy launched an outdoor art exhibition featuring American street art with a climate change theme."}
