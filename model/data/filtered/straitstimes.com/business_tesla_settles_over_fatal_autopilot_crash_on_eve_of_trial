That has triggered false advertising claims against Tesla by consumers, as well as civil and criminal government investigations.\nTesla has also faced increasing regulatory scrutiny over the safety of Autopilot and the company\u2019s more sophisticated system, Full Self-Driving, including multiple investigations into alleged defects.\nIn December, Tesla rolled out over-the-air software updates for more than two million vehicles after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Autopilot does not do enough to guard against misuse.\nMr Huang\u2019s widow and children claimed in their lawsuit that he believed his 2017 Model X \u201cwas safer than a human-operated vehicle\u201d, but that it failed to perform as it should have.\nThe family alleged that the Autopilot software became confused and caused the car to swerve out of its lane because it had not been trained to detect barriers in areas where one highway merges with another.\nLawyers for the Huangs were also expected at the trial to make a bigger point that Mr Musk, as the face of Tesla, has for years aggressively promoted Autopilot to the public as better than human drivers despite its limitations.\nThey claimed the marketing of the driving-assistance features set \u201creasonable expectations\u201d among consumers \u2013 even if they did not understand the technology \u2013 that the system would not affirmatively steer their cars into barriers or fail to deploy emergency braking.\nTesla argued the sole cause of the crash was Mr Huang\u2019s \u201chighly extraordinary misuse of his vehicle and its Autopilot features\u201d so that he could play a video game while driving.\nThe company contended that Mr Huang knew Autopilot did not make his Model X autonomous, but chose during morning rush-hour traffic to play Sega\u2019s Total War: Three Kingdoms.\nDuring the 19 minutes he was driving in Autopilot mode before he crashed, Mr Huang\u2019s hands were not detected on the steering wheel 34 per cent of the time, including the final six seconds, Tesla has said in court filings.\nTesla\u2019s website describes Autopilot as \u201can advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety and convenience behind the wheel\u201d.\nThe company says that Autopilot enables its vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically, but that the system\u2019s features require \u201cactive driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous\u201d.\nTesla and a spokesperson for the Huang family\u2019s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
