The company, one of China\u2019s top food processors, said it was not involved in the fraud.\nChinese commodity trading has been hit by a series of scandals in recent years, including cases where fraudulent financial documents and warehouse receipts were used as proof of collateral and credit. The filing by the unit of Singapore-listed Wilmar, co-founded by billionaire Kuok Khoon Hong, gives a rare insight into commodity trading in the world\u2019s largest consumer.\nThe case focuses on state-owned trader Anhui Whywin International and its palm oil deals with private feed trader Yunnan Huijia Import and Export, according to the indictment cited in the filing. The prosecutor alleges that Huijia used forged documents to obtain palm oil deliveries from Whywin without paying the full amounts, the indictment said. The prosecutor alleges that the Yihai Kerry unit was also involved in the case.\nYihai Kerry said all transactions conducted by its Guangzhou unit in the trades were in compliance with normal practices and contractual agreements. The company did not obtain any improper benefit from Huijia, nor did it participate in the alleged fraud against Whywin, according to the filing. BLOOMBERG"}
