The negotiations must put it front and centre,\u201d Mr Stiell told reporters.\n\u201cAt the end of next week, we need COP to deliver a bullet train to speed up climate action. We currently have an old caboose chugging over rickety tracks.\n\u201cAll governments must give their negotiators clear marching orders. We need the highest ambitions, not point scoring or lowest common denominator politics,\u201d he added.\nThe conference got off to a positive start on Nov 30 with agreement on setting up a fund to help poorer nations cope with irreparable loss and damage from climate impacts, such as storms, floods and droughts.\nThe fund, to be initially hosted by the World Bank, has so far attracted pledges of more than US$700 million (S$938 million), but is far from the hundreds of billions of dollars experts say are needed.\nTrillions of dollars will also be needed to achieve a goal, backed by about 120 nations at COP28, to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Developing nations will need huge sums to fund the green transition, meet their energy needs, and switch away from fossil fuels.\nMr Stiell called for greater transparency on financing pledges and for promises to fund climate action across the world to be fully delivered.\nIn an update on pledges at the conference, the COP28 UAE presidency said on Dec 6 that more than US$83 billion had been announced in the first five days across a variety of initiatives.\nOn Dec 8, the talks shift into a higher gear, with ministers arriving to lead their negotiating teams and drive progress.\nA major focus for many nations is trying to reach a decision on phasing out fossil fuels \u2013 language strongly rejected by the fossil fuel industry and big fossil fuel exporting nations. For nearly 30 years, the industry has fought to keep out references to fossil fuels in final decision texts at UN talks.\nBut the key role of fossil fuels in driving the climate crisis dominates discussions at COP. And the UAE, as host of COP28, will need to find a way to include calls to switch away from coal, oil and gas, analysts say.\nThe UAE is also in the spotlight. It has ambitious expansion plans for oil and gas production, and the COP28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, is the head of the emirate\u2019s main oil and gas firm, drawing ongoing accusations of conflict of interest."}
