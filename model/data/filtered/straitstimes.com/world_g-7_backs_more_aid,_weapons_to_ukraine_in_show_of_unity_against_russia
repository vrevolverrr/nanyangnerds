Never before have we stood more united,\" she said on Twitter.\nPutin had no intention of stopping the war, Borrell said, adding that the new EU military support would be for heavy weapons such as tanks and artillery and take the bloc's aid to about \u20ac2 billion.\n\"(It will be) more pressure on Russia with economic sanctions and continuing the international isolation of Russia and countering misinformation,\" he said.\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba challenged the EU to impose the oil embargo, saying Putin would celebrate if the proposal fell through. Ukraine's neighbour Hungary has opposed the plan, which requires unanimity to pass.\n\"We do not interfere in their discussion, but it's a critical moment when we will see whether EU unity will continue to exist or whether it will be broken,\" he said.\nKuleba called on allies to seize Russian assets to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine, a proposal backed by Germany's Finance Minister Christian Lindner in an interview published by Germany weekly Der Spiegel on Friday.\nGermany this weekend separately will host ministers from Nato, as Sweden and Finland gear up to apply for membership of the transatlantic alliance, drawing threats of retaliation from Moscow and objections from Nato member Turkey.\nMoldova alarm\nThe war in Ukraine has sent global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser soaring, with United Nations agencies warning that the price hikes will worsen a food crisis in Africa in particular.\nRussia's invasion has disrupted shipping in the Black Sea, a major route for grains and other commodities, throttling exports.\nDiplomatic sources said the aim was for the seven countries to organise themselves better to find quick and efficient answers to the food crisis. With Russia blockading Ukrainian ports, efforts will likely centre on speeding up shipments of produce on goods trains to the rest of Europe."}
