While the Government uses TraceTogether data only for contact tracing, it cannot ignore provisions in the law to use the data for law enforcement, he said.\nLawyers The Straits Times spoke to echoed a point that Dr Balakrishnan had made on how the CPC applies not only to TraceTogether, but to other kinds of sensitive data protected by privacy laws such as phone or banking records.\nMr Jonathan Kok, a technology lawyer at Withers KhattarWong, said the police have always been empowered under the CPC to issue a written order to require a person to produce any document or data they believe are necessary for their investigations.\n\"So if the police require a person to produce his TraceTogether device for their investigations, they are already empowered to do so under the CPC,\" he said.\nLISTEN TO THE BIG STORY PODCAST"}
