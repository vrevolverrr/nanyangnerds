Of this figure, 66 per cent comes from forestry crime, illegal mining and waste trafficking.\nWhen asked what prompted the new laws, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said: \u201cAs a responsible member of the international community, we need to do our part to help tackle this global problem. The legislative amendments will allow us to do so.\u201d\nMr Thong Chee Kun, partner and co-head of fraud, asset recovery and investigations practice at law firm Rajah and Tann, said the expanded scope of the laws allows for greater cooperation with foreign counterparts, which could result in prosecutions both in Singapore and overseas.\nAdditionally, with wildlife trade offences listed as serious offences under the Organised Crime Act from Aug 30, offenders could receive enhanced penalties of up to 20 years\u2019 jail and will have their ill-gotten gains confiscated.\nMHA said while past cases did not show links to organised crime groups in Singapore, this change in laws would deter criminals from trading in wildlife here.\nEnvironmental groups have stressed going after the money as a vital step in stemming environmental crimes.\nMs Katarzyna Henn, assistant director of illicit markets at Interpol, said addressing money laundering targets what environmental criminals care about most: their profits. \u201cMoney laundering is the lifeblood of environmental crime networks, as it allows them to integrate illicit earnings into the economy. Without access to sophisticated financial mechanisms, criminals\u2019 ability to profit from such crimes is significantly hindered.\u201d\nMs Kanitha Krishnasamy, director for wildlife trade watchdog Traffic in South-east Asia, said following the money trail is vital to estimate the amount of money generated by criminal activity as a basis for asset recovery.\nIn its 2021 report, FATF called upon countries to assess their money laundering risks related to environmental crime.\nSingapore published its first-ever environmental crimes money laundering national risk assessment in May, which Ms Genevieve Pang, a lawyer from Shook Lin and Bok, said appeared to be undertaken for the country to align with FATF\u2019s standards.\nMr Joseph Chun, her colleague, said: \u201cTackling the illegal asset and financial flows hurts the behind-the-scenes kingpins of the trade rather than only the runners who may end up in prison.\u201d\nWhen precious stones fund bombs\nMost people might not know illegal gains from environmental crime are funding terrorists.\nThe World Atlas of Illicit Flows, published in 2018, found that the proceeds of environmental crime are the largest source of income for non-state armed groups and terrorist organisations. They account for 38 per cent of the financing of conflicts, even more than drugs, illegal taxation and extortion.\nThe FATF report found that insurgent and terrorist groups could use the gains from environmental crimes to pay for guns and drugs.\nIllegal mining, for example, generates precious metals and stones. These groups could use these as payment instead of moving money through official financial sectors.\nA BBC report in May said that in Mozambique, the al-Shabaab insurgent group, linked to ISIS, has been smuggling fauna and flora products and illegally logging the country\u2019s forests. The report estimated that these crimes generate about US$2 million monthly for the insurgent group.\nSo, by disrupting money flows from environmental crime, Singapore could stop organised crime on a larger scale.\nChasing the money\nBut following the money is an uphill task. Although Singapore has investigated money laundering related to environmental crime, there have been no successful convictions so far.\nMs Henn said criminals often use shell companies, cryptocurrencies and offshore accounts in jurisdictions with weak regulations to obscure their transactions.\nSenior investigation officer (IO) Mohamed Arshatharif Sultanul Arifeen from the Commercial Affairs Department\u2019s asset confiscation branch said they seek help from foreign counterparts to chase the money.\nBut cross-border cooperation might not always be smooth.\nHe said: \u201cSome operational challenges include working with certain jurisdictions, which may not be forthcoming or timely in providing assistance or responding to our information requests.\u201d\nSingapore remains vigilant against such threats. There were 49,846 suspicious transaction reports (STRs) in Singapore in 2022, 9 per cent more than the number of reports the year before.\nIO Arshatharif said red flags for environmental crime include shipments of wildlife with incomplete certificates or transactions with high-risk countries for illegal wildlife trade.\nMost of the STRs in 2022 came from the banking sector. Mr Daniel Ng, head of group compliance in UOB, said the bank once found questionable supporting trade documents linked to a customer who transacted with parties allegedly linked to illegal logging.\nOn another occasion, the bank reviewed the account of a customer who had been jailed and fined for illegal waste dumping, and found transactions inconsistent with its company profile.\nIn both cases, UOB reported the customers to the authorities and ended its relationship with them.\nMr Thong said: \u201cIt is always important to disincentivise crime. Depriving criminals of the fruits of their labour is part of a holistic strategy to prevent, deter and punish criminal activity.\u201d"}
