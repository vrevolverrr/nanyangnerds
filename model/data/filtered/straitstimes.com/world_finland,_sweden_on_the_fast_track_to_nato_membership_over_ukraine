This is a historic day. A new era is opening,\u201d Mr Niinisto said.\n\u201cI, or Finland, are not known to sneak around and quietly disappear behind a corner. It is better to say it straight what already has been said, also to the concerned party and that is what I wanted to do,\u201d he added, in reference to his call with Mr Putin.\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that \u201cPutin stressed that abandoning the traditional policy of military neutrality would be a mistake, since there are no threats to Finland\u2019s security\u201d.\nThe Finland President downplayed concerns of Russian aggression, asserting that while there would be pushback from Moscow \u201clittle by little, I\u2019m beginning to think that we\u2019re not going to face actual military operations\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Sweden\u2019s long-ruling Social Democrats dropped their decades-old policy of military non-alignment on Sunday to open the doors to Nato membership.\nWhile the senior leadership was in favour of reversing their party\u2019s traditional opposition to joining Nato, some dissenting voices had emerged to label any such move as hasty.\nBut an even greater number of MPs \u2013 some of whom had made their support contingent on Finland joining the bloc \u2013 threw their support behind the proposal, creating a large parliamentary majority in favour.\nThe two Nordic nations are now likely to submit a formal application within days, with Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin stating: \u201cHopefully, we can send our applications next week together with Sweden.\u201d\nNato foreign ministers holding talks over the weekend in Berlin that were focused on the membership bids indicated that the accession process \u2013 which usually takes up to a year \u2013 would be expedited.\n\u201cGermany has prepared everything to do a quick ratification process,\u201d Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said, adding that security guarantees must be extended to assuage fears of Russian retaliation.\n\u201cWe must make sure that we will give them security guarantees, there must not be a transition period, a grey zone, where their status is unclear,\u201d she said."}
