Lo also pointed out other recurring issues, such as booking a seat on the bus from Hong Kong to Shenzhen.\nLo noted that the opening of the border between Hong Kong and mainland China would depend on Hong Kong's epidemic situation and the reduction of community infections.\nHong Kong on Monday reported 1,645 local coronavirus infections, and 196 imported infections.\nLo's post generated some discussion on China's Weibo social media platform, with some users expressing opposition to the measure due to fears of imported infections and the resulting lockdowns that could trigger in mainland China.\n\"You can't open up so much ... the moment there is a problem it will implicate a lot of people, the transmission rate of the virus is so high right now,\" wrote user Ci1027.\nOther Weibo users expressed hope that Lo's blog post signalled a reopening soon, while reserving skepticism that the Aug 4 deadline was feasible. \"If this actually comes true it would be the best piece of news this year,\" one user from neighbouring Guangdong province wrote."}
