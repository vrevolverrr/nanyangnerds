Tokyo Electron, Japan\u2019s leading chip manufacturing equipment maker, relies on China for about a quarter of its revenue.\nThe other top producers of chip-making gear are the United States and the Netherlands, home to ASML, another of the world\u2019s biggest makers of chip-making tools.\nSeeking a deal\nUS officials are quick to play down the differences between the United States, Japan and other allies.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a very, very similar vision of the challenges,\u201d a senior US administration official told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that Japanese export restrictions may not be exactly the same as the US controls.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Japanese question the basic premise that we need to be working closely together on this.\u201d\nA US Commerce Department official said in October he expected a deal with allies in the near term.\nNetherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte will travel to Washington to meet Mr Biden on Jan 17 and discuss \u201ccooperation on critical technologies and shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d the White House said on Thursday.\nStill, said Mr Daniel Russel, a former top US diplomat for Asia, a gap remains between the US and Japanese positions.\n\u201cKishida wants the US to take a Goldilocks approach that is tough enough to deter Chinese assertiveness, but cautious enough to allow Japan\u2019s business interests to thrive,\u201d he said.\nBehind the US drive for high-tech export controls is rising alarm about China\u2019s military buildup and its effort to outpace the United States in technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\nFearing that this will yield a military edge for an increasingly assertive China, US officials hope that keeping the most sophisticated chips - and the tools needed to make them - out of China\u2019s hands will slow the country\u2019s progress on advanced technologies.\nBut unless Japan and the Netherlands impose their own export controls, China will soon perfect other ways of getting the equipment it needs, even as American companies stand to lose market share.\nA US deal with the Netherlands could also be within reach. One toolmaking industry executive familiar with that country\u2019s sector said that if the Dutch government imposed similar export controls on its industry, ASML would probably not suffer a severe impact due to its extensive network of customers beyond China.\nIf US diplomacy succeeds, its policies could have the intended impact, argues Chris Miller, author of \u201cChip War\u201d and an associate professor at Tufts University.\nWith Japan on board, particularly in terms of chip manufacturing tools, the United States could put up \u201ca really large number of road blocks to China\u2019s ability to advance its own domestic chipmaking,\u201d Assoc Prof Miller said.\nThat would have knock-on effects for Beijing\u2019s other tech ambitions, including in artificial intelligence.\nJapanese companies can make up for lost China business by expanding elsewhere, such as South-east Asia, a chip industry source familiar with internal discussions about export restrictions said.\n\u201cFor better or worse, Japan\u2019s semiconductor strategy is moving in accordance with what the United States wants.\u201d REUTERS"}
