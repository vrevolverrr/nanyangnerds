It is stable and offers a lot of investment opportunities,\u201d Mr Zhang told Reuters at a business and philanthropy forum here late last year. His family might establish a Singapore family office to manage its wealth in the future, he added.\nHosting discussions on topics like family wealth and sustainable investing, the forum at Singapore\u2019s Shangri-La hotel was attended by hundreds of wealthy people, many bedecked in designer gear from Hermes belt buckles to monogrammed Gucci shawls to the latest Dior bags. Several Chinese attendees said they had recently relocated to Singapore or were thinking of doing so.\nWith its tax-friendly regime and seen as politically stable, Singapore has long been a haven for ultra-rich foreigners.\nBut it has seen a fresh influx of wealth since 2021 after it became one of the first Asian cities to significantly ease pandemic restrictions and as many Chinese became disillusioned with their country\u2019s draconian Covid-19 policies.\nThis disenchantment propelled Mr Zhang, who gained Hong Kong residency in 2021, to look at Singapore.\n\u201cWe just lost patience over time,\u201d he said, describing the lengthy quarantines he had to endure when travelling between Hong Kong and mainland China. Political turmoil in Hong Kong had also been disheartening, he added.\nFamily office boom\nSingapore\u2019s number of family offices \u2013 which handle investments, taxation, wealth transfer and other financial matters for the super rich \u2013 surged to about 700 in 2021 from 400 the year before.\nWell-known Singapore family offices include those set up by British billionaire inventor James Dyson, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and Mr Zhang Yong, founder of China\u2019s Haidilao hotpot restaurant chain.\nAlthough fresher statistics are not available, those involved in the industry said interest in family offices picked up in 2022 and is expected to continue unabated in 2023.\nChina\u2019s abandonment of its zero-Covid policies is not expected to change the trend, given concern among the country\u2019s rich about President Xi Jinping\u2019s common prosperity drive that aimed to reduce inequality, they added.\nMr Chung Ting Fai, a lawyer who helps set up family offices, said that in late 2022, he had one inquiry a week from people who wanted to move at least US$20 million (S$26.3 million) into Singapore. That was up from about an inquiry a month in 2021, while in January 2023, he received two inquiries a week.\nMany were parents looking to obtain permanent residency for their children, he said, noting that inquiries also came from Japanese and Malaysian potential clients apart from the Chinese.\nPart of Singapore\u2019s attraction for the rich is its government-administered global investor programme, under which people who invest at least $2.5 million in a business, fund or family office can apply for permanent residency.\nMs Grace Tang, executive director at Phillip Private Equity, which operates one of two global investor programme funds in Singapore, said her new year had been filled with meetings with potential investors, most of them Chinese.\nWhile some were setting up family offices, others were setting up business headquarters in Singapore or investing in funds domiciled in Singapore, she said.\nWealth management hub\nSingapore\u2019s assets under management grew 16 per cent to $5.4 trillion in 2021 \u2013 the latest year for which data is available. More than three-quarters of that originated outside the country, with just under a third coming from other Asia-Pacific countries.\nThe influx of wealth is part of a wider trend of people returning to Singapore after an exodus of expatriates during the pandemic.\nLast year, the city had 30,000 more permanent residents and 97,000 more foreigners on a work or other long-term visa, boosting its population to 5.64 million.\nThe new additions sent rents surging 21 per cent in the first nine months of 2022.\nHome prices have also jumped over the past two years, with mainland Chinese buyers continuing to be the top foreign buyers of expensive private properties.\nAnother telling sign of how private wealth is flowing in is skyrocketing golf club memberships. The cost of membership to Singapore\u2019s prestigious Sentosa Golf Club has hit $880,000 for foreigners, more than double 2019 levels, according to club membership brokerage Singolf Services.\nMr Desmond Teo, Asia-Pacific family enterprise leader at consulting firm EY, said the inflows of money supported Singapore\u2019s financial services sector and start-ups, creating a \u201crich ecosystem\u201d that made the country more attractive to new stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you hit a certain critical mass, the critical mass itself is an attraction,\u201d he said.
