It said it was introducing an \u201canti-terror regime\u201d in Belgorod, a first since the start of Moscow\u2019s campaign in Ukraine in February 2022.\nMonday\u2019s incursion, apparently involving armoured vehicles, was the biggest raid into Russia since the war began 15 months ago, though details including the number of fighters involved, their affiliation and the extent of any clashes, could not be independently confirmed.\nMr Gladkov said on Tuesday that the \u201cdefence ministry and law enforcement are continuing to clear the area\u201d.\nHe previously said eight people were injured, adding that the authorities were helping people leave the scene of the fighting.\nHe added on Tuesday that it was too soon for residents who had fled to return to their homes, and said the authorities would give the all-clear when it was safe.\nMembers of the anti-Kremlin Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) have claimed responsibility for the incursion into Belgorod, but Kyiv has denied any involvement.\nIn a video released by a Telegram channel claiming to represent the group, a camouflaged spokesman, surrounded by armed men in fatigues, said: \u201cRussia will be free!\u201d, a slogan frequently used by Russian opposition activists.\n\u2018Guerrilla groups\u2019\n\u201cWe want our children to grow up in peace and be free,\u201d the spokesman added, with the channel claiming that two settlements, including Graivoron, were attacked.\nThe RVC published video footage late on Monday showing what it said was a fighter inspecting a captured armoured vehicle, putting a sticker with the group\u2019s logo over the \u201cZ\u201d symbol used to identify Russian forces.\nAnother video showed what it said were fighters operating an armoured vehicle on a country road. Other videos posted on Russian and Ukrainian social media channels showed pictures and video of what were described as captured Russian servicemen and their identity documents.\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mikhaylo Podolyak suggested that Russian \u201cguerrilla groups\u201d could be responsible.\n\u201cThe only driving political force in a totalitarian country of tightened screws is always an armed guerrilla movement,\u201d he said on Monday."}
