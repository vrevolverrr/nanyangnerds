The Indianapolis-based company is now testing its drug in a 1,500-person trial with volunteers in China, Taiwan, South Korea and the European Union, a spokesperson said.\nThe size of Eisai\u2019s planned China roll-out and the filing of Eli Lilly\u2019s approval application have not previously been reported.\nLeqembi, which works by removing a toxic protein called beta amyloid from the brain, is the first Alzheimer\u2019s treatment proven to alter the course of the fatal, brain-wasting disease. China approved Leqembi in January.\nEisai and US partner Biogen have already rolled out Leqembi in the United States and Japan, and it is under review in Europe.\nThe treatment, given by infusion twice a month, slowed progression of the disease by 27 per cent for patients in the earliest stages of Alzheimer\u2019s in a clinical trial.\nCurrent treatments available in China have limited effect, and Eisai\u2019s trial results give patients \u201ca lot of hope\u201d, said Alzheimer\u2019s expert Dr Liu Zhou of Guangdong Medical University.\nEisai said it expects to start using the drug in China by September, and forecast a total of 1,500 patients there by March 2025, a number limited by the country\u2019s diagnostic capabilities.\nLeqembi\u2019s sales could \u201cincrease significantly\u201d in 2025, the company said, with the expected introduction of blood tests to assess a patient\u2019s amyloid burden rather than PET scans or invasive lumbar punctures, which require access to specialists.\n\u201cIf treatment were to become possible based solely on blood tests, we think it would generate significant interest,\u201d Citi analyst Hidemaru Yamaguchi said in a research note. He did not have an estimate for China but expects Leqembi sales outside of Japan and the US to peak in 2030 at 126 billion yen (S$1.1 billion).\nRates of Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis and treatment in Asia\u2019s biggest economy remain low, and medical specialists and public awareness of the disease is limited, according to The China Alzheimer Report 2022, published in the BMJ General Psychiatry journal.\nChina\u2019s Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.\nExperts said the country has been ramping up imaging capacity.\nSiemens Healthineers, which sells imaging equipment in China, said the market in China for molecular imaging has grown more than 45 per cent over the past four years.\n\u2018Ill prepared\u2019\nEisai plans to launch Leqembi on China\u2019s private market, where it is priced at about 200,000 yuan (S$37,000) a year, about US$2,000 more than in the US.\nEisai said it will decide whether to seek government coverage after it assesses private market demand.\nInclusion on China\u2019s National Reimbursement Drug List typically means a steep price cut. A 2023 analysis estimated the average negotiated price cut ranged from 44 per cent to 61 per cent.\nTo be eligible for treatment, patients undergo cognitive testing, genetic testing to assess whether they carry a gene that increases the drug\u2019s adverse side effects, and testing to confirm abnormal levels of amyloid, the sticky substance in the brain targeted by Leqembi.\nOnce on treatment, suitable patients undergo a series of MRI scans to monitor for potentially fatal swelling and bleeding in the brain.\nEconomist Soeren Mattke, director of the University of Southern California Brain Health Observatory who has consulted for both Eisai and Biogen, said China lacks a system of primary care physicians to do preliminary testing and refer appropriate candidates to specialists.\nDr Mattke and colleagues published an assessment of China\u2019s readiness for disease-modifying treatments in July in the Journal Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia that concluded that China is \u201cill-prepared to provide timely access to an Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\u201d.\n\u201cIn China,\u201d he said, \u201cspeciality care is almost absent in the rural areas.\u201d REUTERS"}
