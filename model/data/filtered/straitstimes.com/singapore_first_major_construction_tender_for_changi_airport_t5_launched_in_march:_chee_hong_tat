T2C will provide baggage and inter-terminal links to ensure a seamless connection between T5 and the existing terminals at Changi,\u201d Mr Chee said at the ceremony, which honoured Changi Airport\u2019s airline partners for their contributions to its growth as a global air hub.\nWhen operational in the mid-2030s, T5 will be able to handle up to 50 million passengers a year. This is more than the current capacities of Terminals 1 and 3 combined.\nT5 will be located within the new 1,080ha Changi East development, Changi Airport\u2019s largest expansion project to date that will be three times the size of Marina Bay.\nIt also includes the Changi East Urban District, a business and lifestyle hub next to the terminal.\nPart of ongoing infrastructural works at the Changi East development, the 2.5km-long T2 Connection will link T5 with Changi\u2019s existing terminals when the mega terminal opens.\nIt will comprise tunnels for an automated people-mover system \u2013 similar to the Skytrain, which takes travellers between Changi\u2019s existing terminals \u2013 and a separate system to handle baggage.\nEarlier in February, construction work for the underground link at Changi East appeared as a new line item in the Government\u2019s projected development expenditure for Budget 2024, with a total project cost exceeding $722 million.\nPreparatory work for the new underground link is already under way.\nAccording to stock exchange filings, the Singapore subsidiary of Chinese construction firm Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co was awarded a $622 million contract in October 2023 by CAG to design and build underground structures for the new T2 underground link.\nThe contract, which also includes the restoration of airport infrastructure and road surfaces that are affected by the works, is slated to be completed in October 2028.\nConstruction work on Changi Airport\u2019s fifth and biggest terminal, announced in 2013, was meant to start around 2020.\nThe project was paused for two years, however, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWork resumed in 2022.\nDuring the two-year downtime, the mega terminal was redesigned to be more resilient \u2013 in particular, to operate more safely and flexibly during a pandemic.\nIt can be split and operated as smaller sub-terminals when needed, with spaces that can be converted into quarantine or testing facilities.\nIt will have contactless passenger touchpoints and ventilation systems that can increase fresh air or minimise mixing of air when there is a threat of an airborne disease.\nThe new terminal will also be greener and more energy-efficient. Autonomous vehicles and robotics could be used to support cargo transport and baggage handling."}
