In the early 1930s, when the banks were calling in their massive loans to his businesses, family members were cast out into the streets from their mortgaged homes.\nDuring the Japanese invasion in 1942, his open resistance to the Japanese Occupation in China forced him into hiding in Java, with the Japanese placing a ransom of a million Dutch guilders on his head.\nHis family broke into two groups and fled to China and India. Some unmarried sons were left behind in Singapore to fend for themselves.\nA new book by his granddaughter, Ms Peggy Tan, now gives intimate insights into the quiet resilience of the businessman, his family and descendants.\nTitled Descendants Of Tan Kah Kee And Their Stories, it was launched at Ee Hoe Hean Club on March 22.\nThe 304-page English publication includes chapters on Tan\u2019s famous and powerful in-laws, such as businessmen Lee Kong Chian and Lim Nee Soon, as well as those who moved in his world, including businessman Tan Lark Sye and physician Lim Boon Keng. These Singapore pioneers were also philanthropists.\nIt also features essays contributed by several of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nBorn in 1874 in a fishing village in Fujian, China, Tan sailed to Singapore around 1890 to help his father, who owned a rice trading business in Singapore.\nIn 1903, after his father\u2019s business collapsed, Tan started his own company and built a multifaceted business empire that included rubber plantations, manufacturing, pineapple canneries and shipping.\nHe was known for his passion for eliminating poverty among the masses by establishing schools, including Xiamen University in China and The Chinese High School in Singapore. He also donated to Tao Nan Primary School and Anglo-Chinese School.\nHe died in 1961 in Beijing, aged 86.\nHis granddaughter, Ms Tan, who was born in 1949 in Singapore, is the daughter of Mr Tan Guan Kai, the sixth son of Tan Kah Kee and the first son of his second wife Goh Shiok-Neo. She never met her grandfather, as he had left Singapore for China by the time she was born.\nThis is the 74-year-old\u2019s first book, and it took the retired managing director of an advertising company about four years to complete, after her retirement.\n\u201cI should have embarked on this project 15 to 20 years ago, when more of my cousins were alive... and my book would be thicker by 100 pages,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI honestly felt that I could qualify for a detective\u2019s certificate after this book was done.\u201d"}
