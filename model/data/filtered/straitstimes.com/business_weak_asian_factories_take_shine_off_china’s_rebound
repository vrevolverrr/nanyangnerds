That means other Asian countries must compete with China for demand that\u2019s not growing.\n\u201cWith no clear driver of global growth, it\u2019s hard to paint a rosy outlook for Asia.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s final au Jibun Bank PMI stood at 48.2 in March, the highest level since November and recovering from February\u2019s 47.2, which marked the fastest pace of contraction in over 3\u00bd years.\nBut activity contracted for a 10th straight month as new export orders slumped, reflecting souring sentiment in key markets like China and North America, the survey showed.\nSouth Korea\u2019s manufacturing activity also weakened in March as slowing domestic demand offset robust overseas sales, with the PMI falling to 49.8 in March from 50.7 in February.\nVietnam\u2019s PMI dropped to 49.9 in March from 50.4 in February, and Malaysia\u2019s declined to 48.4 from 49.5, the surveys showed. Taiwan\u2019s PMI also contracted in March, coming in at 49.3, although this was an improvement from 48.6 in February. By contrast, manufacturing activity expanded in March in the Philippines and Indonesia, the surveys showed.\nIn revised forecasts issued in January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected Asia\u2019s economy to expand 4.5 per cent in 2024, driven by robust US demand and the boost from expected stimulus measures in China. But it said the recovery would be divergent across economies, with Japan likely to see growth slow to 0.9 per cent, in contrast to an expected 6.5 per cent expansion in India.\nThe IMF expects China\u2019s economy to expand 4.6 per cent in 2024, slowing from 5.2 per cent in 2023.
