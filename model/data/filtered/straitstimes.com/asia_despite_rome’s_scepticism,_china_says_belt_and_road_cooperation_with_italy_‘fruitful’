Otherwise, it will be extended for another five years.\nAny loss of the erstwhile terminus of the old Silk Road would be diplomatically embarrassing for China, which has expected to mark the achievements of the Belt and Road initiative at an international forum in Beijing in October.\nChina and Italy should adhere to the right way of getting along with each other through mutual respect, openness and cooperation, Mr Wang told Mr Tajani.\nHe stressed that in the face of \u201cnew situations and new opportunities\u201d, China is willing to adhere to openness and a win-win for both sides.
