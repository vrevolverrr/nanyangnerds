Both companies saw their shares soar in the first few days of trading.\nProfessional services firm EY noted in an April 8 report that there has been significant growth in the number of AI and AI-associated businesses backed by venture capital. \u201cThis suggests there could be a surge in IPOs in future years as these companies mature in the private domain before making a public debut.\u201d\nBut research manager Peggy Mak at brokerage Phillip Securities Research noted that tech and AI companies wanting to launch IPOs are likely to choose exchanges in the US, Hong Kong or London over Singapore.\nOne reason is the lack of variety in the industries in Singapore in which listed companies are involved.\n\u201cThe Singapore market lacks companies that operate in the internet, software and communications segment. We cannot exactly name a listed company that is a direct beneficiary of AI. We have only a small video game art studio, Winking Studios, listed on the SGX.\u201d\nInstead, \u201cwe have a high concentration of asset-heavy companies on the SGX. These tend to deliver lower return on equity, and are less-attractive in a higher interest rate environment\u201d.\nThis year, only one company has listed on the SGX so far \u2013 Singapore Institute of Advanced Medicine Holdings, a cancer-treatment provider, which raised around $21.7 million in net proceeds.\nAnother Singapore firm, ride-hailing and carpooling firm Ryde, took its listing to the New York Stock Exchange, joining a growing number of Singapore-based tech companies tapping the US stock market for funds.\nThe SGX, however, is not the only bourse contending with a decline in IPOs. For the first three months of the year, the number of deals in mainland China and Hong Kong decreased by more than half, while deal size contracted by nearly two-thirds, according to EY.\nIn March, Chinese-owned Swiss agrichemicals and seeds group Syngenta withdrew its bid for a multibillion-dollar listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange that had been postponed several times since it was first proposed in 2021, owing to unfavourable market conditions.\nChinese internet company Alibaba Group also cancelled the planned listing of its logistics arm, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network, citing challenging IPO market conditions as one of the reasons for the pullback.\nLondon has also lost its appeal as an IPO destination, with companies raising just US$1 billion on the London Stock Exchange in 2023, the least since 2009.\nSome experts reckon the local bourse will eventually come to a level playing field with its international peers.\nSaid SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye: \u201cIn this new environment where interest rates are normalising, astute investors with wider investment choices will look for quality companies, which SGX\u2019s international capital-raising platform is well poised to support.\u201d\nHe added that as the economy continues to grow, \u201cmany more companies will consider (listing) or eventually come to list here over the medium to long term\u201d.\nIt could be just a matter of time before a listing for a company, noted Ms Tay of Deloitte, who added that \u201cthere is a wealth of high-calibre local companies with excellent fundamentals and sound business models in Singapore\u201d.\n\u201cWith various private fund-raising opportunities available locally, these companies are able to hold off tapping the Singapore equity capital markets until the right window for an IPO.\u201d\nKPMG Singapore\u2019s partner and head of deal advisory Stephen Bates noted that with more IPOs in regional emerging markets such as Indonesia coming up, Singapore also stands to gain should these companies seek dual listings outside their domestic market."}
