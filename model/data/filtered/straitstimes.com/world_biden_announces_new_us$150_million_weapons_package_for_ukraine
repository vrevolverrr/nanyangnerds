House of Representatives and Senate leaders have said they want to move quickly, but have not yet said when they will vote on Biden\u2019s request.\nBiden urged lawmakers to work quickly, saying the latest weapons authorisation \u201cnearly exhausted\u201d drawdown authority funding. \u201cCongress should quickly provide the requested funding to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,\u201d his statement said.\nThe United States has been training some Ukrainian forces, outside Ukraine, on how to use systems like the howitzers.\nThe new package was announced as Biden prepared to join other Group of Seven leaders in a video call on Sunday in a show of unity with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky a day before Russia marks its Victory Day holiday.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin casts the war in Ukraine as a battle to protect Russian speakers there from persecution by Nazis and to guard against what he calls the US threat to Russia posed by Nato enlargement.\nUkraine and the West reject the fascism claim as baseless and say Putin is waging an unprovoked war of aggression.\nUkraine and its allies say that after failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, Russian forces have made slow progress in their goal of capturing the country\u2019s east and south but bombardments have affected more and more civilians.\nRussia denies the allegations and says it targets only military or strategic sites, not civilians."}
