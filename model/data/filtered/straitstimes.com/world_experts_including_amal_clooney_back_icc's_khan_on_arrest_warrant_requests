The court has no means to enforce such warrants, and its investigation into the Gaza war has been opposed by the United States and Israel.\nMore than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the enclave's health ministry, and aid agencies have warned of widespread hunger and shortages.\nIsrael began its military offensive in Hamas-governed Gaza after a raid led by the Palestinian Islamist militant group in which 1,200 people were killed in Israel and more than 250 taken hostage on Oct. 7 last year, according to Israeli tallies.\nClooney is an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School and the panel also included Israeli-American Theodor Meron, who is the former president of the U.N. tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and lived through the Holocaust as a boy in Poland.\nAlso on the panel were former ICC judge Adrian Fulford, international law and human rights expert Danny Friedman, British House of Lords member Helena Kennedy, and Elizabeth Wilmshurst, a former deputy legal adviser at the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\nThey were supported by international law professors Marko Milanovic and Sandesh Sivakumaran, who acted as academic advisers.
