We maintain that we do not prescribe any form of flexible working arrangements, because it really doesn\u2019t help in opening up the space for employers and employees to push boundaries and discuss what works for themselves and the business.\u201d\nMr Ng said: \u201cWhen employers accommodate flexibility, employees have to be flexible too, as businesses evolve, and sometimes some of the flexible work that\u2019s accorded may not be a permanent feature.\u201d\nMr Sim said: \u201cEven for the same job role, it may not be the case that every individual gets the same kind of flexibility, partly because the moment one staff member is given a certain flexibility, the constraints that the employer now faces is different.\u201d\nOne example of an arrangement that does not neatly fit into the three categories is a four-day work week with shorter total work hours but no reduction in pay, which the panellists urged caution on.\nMs Gan said workers seeking such an arrangement need to consider if net output from the employer would be affected if more people were not hired.\nShe added: \u201cIf there\u2019s no negative impact, then, if the employer wants to accommodate that kind of flexibility, carry on. If there\u2019s no drop in the productivity, the remuneration should also not be affected.\n\u201cBut if that form of four-day work week some people are asking for results in the employer having to go hire more people, (with an) increase in business costs, then, surely, the remuneration package will have to be reviewed for the person who wants to go on that form of four-day work week.\u201d\nMr Sim said of the guidelines: \u201cIt is meant to maximise our workforce potential and not to try to reduce our overall capacity.\u201d"}
