The model has been in service since the 1980s but is being phased out in the French military.\nThe tanks are light and six-wheeled, rather than on tracks. They were designed for reconnaissance missions and have been deployed in France\u2019s most recent overseas military operations in the Sahel region of West Africa and in Afghanistan.\nThey are \u201cvery mobile... perhaps old but high-performance\u201d, a French official said.\nWhile the official said these would be the first Western armoured vehicles delivered to Ukraine, Australia has given Kyiv 90 of its Bushmaster vehicles, an armoured unit hardened against landmines and other threats.\nUS President Joe Biden said later on Wednesday that Washington was considering sending Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Ukraine, which is fighting Europe\u2019s biggest land conflict since 1945. Cities have been destroyed, millions of people displaced and tens of thousands killed since Russia\u2019s invasion in February.\nThe Bradley armoured vehicle, which has a powerful gun, has been a US Army staple to carry troops around battlefields since the mid-1980s. The US Army has thousands of Bradleys, and they would give Ukraine more firepower on the battlefield and strengthen its ability in trench warfare.\nMr Biden\u2019s move, however, would fall short of sending the Abrams tanks that Ukraine has sought. Kyiv has repeatedly asked Western allies for heavier fighting vehicles such as the Abrams and German-made Leopard tanks.\nIn an evening video address, President Zelensky thanked Mr Macron for the announcement and said it showed the need for other allies to provide heavier weapons.\n\u201cThis is something that sends a clear signal to all our partners. There is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with Western tanks,\u201d he said.\nA senior US administration official on Wednesday gave a sobering assessment of fighting in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, especially around the largely ruined, Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut. Fierce combat is likely to persist for the foreseeable future, although Russian forces have made incremental progress, the official said.\n\u201cThe fighting is still quite hot... I think what we\u2019re seeing in Bakhmut we should expect to see elsewhere along the front that there will be continued fighting in the coming months.\u201d\nIn his video address, Mr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops outside Bakhmut were inflicting numerous losses on the Russians and said Moscow was building up its forces in the region.\nReuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts."}
