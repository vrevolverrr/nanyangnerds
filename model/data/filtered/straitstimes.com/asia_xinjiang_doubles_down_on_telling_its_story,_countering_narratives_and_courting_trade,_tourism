All are members or observers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional defence grouping spearheaded by China and Russia.\nThe move to open its doors \u2013 at least partially, since the foreign journalists had no access to meetings \u2013 was apparently well-supported by Xinjiang party chief Ma Xingrui, a former governor of Guangdong province whom political pundits believe was moved to the far-flung north-western region to steer its economic development.\nHe had replaced Mr Chen Quanguo, who was widely blamed for a crackdown targeted at extremism among the region\u2019s Uighur ethnic minority. Xinjiang came into international focus during his tenure from 2017 to 2021 for its re-education camps and other anti-terror measures that have branded China as a human rights abuser.\nThat portrayal is one that Mr Ma and the Xinjiang government have been eager to change, as officials up and down the chain of command persist in \u201ctelling the Xinjiang story well\u201d.\nXinjiang\u2019s political advisory body chairman Nuerlan Abudumanjin told delegates \u2013 made up of representatives from across sectors \u2013 that they should \u201cstick to positive publicity\u201d and \u201cresolutely oppose the smear and sanctions involving Xinjiang by the United States and other Western countries\u201d.\nThe body had sent delegations to countries in Africa and South-east, West and Central Asia in 2023 to promote Xinjiang and to \u201cenhance the international community\u2019s correct understanding of the real Xinjiang\u201d, he said while delivering his annual report.\nOfficials hosting the visiting diplomatic and media groups also arranged for visits to grassroots organisations, with the view to showcase how Urumqi residents are taken care of. In one local community, a bakery sits next to a cut-and-sew workshop that is beside a flower shop, all providing employment for residents on flexible working hours.\n\u201cWe have Uighurs, Kazakhs, Hui, Han all living here together. There\u2019s no talk of religion. We sometimes visit each other\u2019s homes or eat and play together,\u201d said 30-year-old Ayshemgul Yasin, putting together a bouquet of red roses in the flower shop. She works up to eight hours a day for between 3,500 yuan (S$660) and 6,000 yuan a month.\nAsked if she felt satisfied with her life in Urumqi, she said: \u201cI\u2019m very happy here\u2026 I\u2019m getting a good income.\u201d\nMr Li Xuan, party secretary and deputy director at Xinjiang\u2019s commerce department, said the region\u2019s exports have been hampered by a global trade contraction, but it will roll out policies to help boost its foreign trade.\nThis year, Xinjiang has set a more modest gross domestic product (GDP) target of around 6.5 per cent, although this figure is still higher than the GDP targets of nearly all the other 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions except for Tibet and Hainan, which are both gunning for 8 per cent.\nEconomists expect China\u2019s growth to slow in 2024, with projections averaging 4.6 per cent. In 2023, it expanded by 5.2 per cent. It will announce its GDP target in March, when it convenes its annual parliamentary session.\nMeanwhile, Xinjiang officials are hoping that its \u201cXinjiang is a nice place\u201d campaign will also bring a targeted 300 million tourists in 2024, as it banks on tourism to contribute to its growth. The number of tourists in 2023 reached 267 million.\nXinjiang governor Erkin Tuniyaz told delegates at the recent legislative meeting that the government will aggressively develop its tourism industry by building infrastructure and drawing investors to build new tourist attractions.\nBut even as the autonomous region of 25 million trains its focus on bolstering its economy and cleaning up its sullied image, it is at the same time still on guard, pledging to \u201ccurb extremism, resist infiltration\u201d and \u201cactively guide religions to be compatible with socialist society\u201d, said Mr Tuniyaz.\nMadam Li Juan, who heads the legal affairs commission of Xinjiang\u2019s legislature, said Xinjiang\u2019s social stability after combating terrorism has \u201ccome at a high price to everyone\u201d.\n\u201cBut the situation is dynamic, and we need to adjust it at any time according to the different circumstances, to solve the contradictions and problems at any time,\u201d she told ST."}
