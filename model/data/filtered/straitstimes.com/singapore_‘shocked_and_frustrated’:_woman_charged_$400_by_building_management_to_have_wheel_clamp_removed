There was no negotiation, and the building\u2019s management refused to release my car until I made the payment,\u201d said the analyst. \u201cIn the end, I called the police, who advised me to pay the fee first and then appeal, as the management was adamant not to let me off with a warning.\u201d\nOn the day of the incident \u2013 and after paying the fee \u2013 she e-mailed the Chiap Chuan Building\u2019s management office to lodge an appeal.\nOn June 7, a representative responded that the appeal would be discussed during a council meeting on June 11 and that Ms Ong would be updated on the outcome.\nBut when Ms Ong tried to contact him subsequently on three different days, there was no reply.\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m upset at the lack of transparency and accountability. It\u2019s not just a personal grievance... other vehicle owners might encounter the same thing.\u201d\nWhen contacted, the building\u2019s management office did not give details of the incident. Meanwhile, the representative who communicated with Ms Ong did not respond when ST tried to contact him.\nA check on the Building and Construction Authority\u2019s (BCA) website shows a guide for strata management, which is intended to \u201chelp subsidiary proprietors, council members and managing agents better manage their estates\u201d.\nThis includes a sample list of common additional by-laws set by MCSTs, including those that outline when wheel-clamping devices would be used.\nSuch devices are commonly employed if an unauthorised vehicle is found on the premises, if a vehicle is parked in a particular parking space that it is unauthorised to be in, or if it is found to be parked indiscriminately.\nIn response to queries, a BCA spokesperson said these by-laws are made by MCSTs.\n\u201cSuch by-laws may include where and how vehicles should be parked in the common areas of the development, and the actions that would be taken by the MCST, including the administrative costs that may be recovered by the MCST, if vehicles are parked in breach of the by-laws,\u201d the spokesperson added."}
