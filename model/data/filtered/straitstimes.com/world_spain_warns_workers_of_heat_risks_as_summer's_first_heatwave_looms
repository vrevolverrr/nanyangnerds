The peak of this episode will be on July 19, when most areas will warm up to 40 deg C.\nAEMET has issued a heatwave warning for a large part of Spain, including the Balearic islands in the Mediterranean.\nThe National Institute for Safety and Health at Work launched the campaign \"With sun it's time for caution\" on July 17 to address the risks such as heat stroke and solar radiation.\nAEMET's orange-level severe heat alert in parts of the country will also trigger a ban on some outdoor working in the afternoon under a government decree approved last year to cope with more and more frequent heatwaves as a result of fossil fuel-driven climate change.\nThe measure affects outdoors working such as street cleaning and agriculture.\n\"There are people who are highly affected by such high temperatures, by exposure over many hours and no proper hydration... so my main advice is don\u2019t underestimate them because the body is not prepared to withstand those conditions too long,\" AEMET spokesperson Luis Banon told Reuters.\nThe heatwave is expected to last until July 20 although heat could persist until the middle of next week and will be accompanied by haze coming from Africa, which often exacerbates health problems during heat episodes.\nIn Madrid, where thermometers registered 36 deg C on July 17, people tried to cool off at parks and fountains.\n\"I cope by using a fan if I'm in the street, and if not, by going to places like a shopping centre, or somewhere where it's cooler,\" retired Madrid resident Angela de la Vega told Reuters.
