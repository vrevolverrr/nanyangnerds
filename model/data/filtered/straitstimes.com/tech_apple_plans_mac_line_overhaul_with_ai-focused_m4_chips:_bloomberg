Reuters has reported that Nvidia also plans to use its strength in AI chips to jump into the PC market with a new chip as early as 2025.\nApple is planning to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the new chips, and how they will integrate with the next version of macOS, according to the Bloomberg report.\nApple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe news comes ahead of Apple\u2019s annual developers conference in June, and reports said the iPhone maker could announce new AI partnership and unveil significant changes to the iOS.\nMac sales fell 27 per cent in Apple\u2019s most recent fiscal year ended September. Apple in October unveiled the current-generation M3 chips and new MacBook Pro and iMac computers that were getting them. REUTERS"}
