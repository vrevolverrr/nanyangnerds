We have spoken a lot\u2026 to encourage process, dialogue and architecture that enable de-escalation,\u201d she added, referring also to the South China Sea.\nBeijing has been asserting its expansive claims in the South China Sea, leading to skirmishes between its coast guard and Filipino vessels. Beijing has rejected a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that struck down its claims, saying they lack legal basis.\nChina sees the Australian navy\u2019s movements in the South China Sea as an effort to contain the east Asian nation. Australia, which has rejected this, says it respects the right of all states to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight in accordance with international law.\nMs Wong has been Australia\u2019s foreign minister since the current Albanese administration came into power in 2022. She has worked to help stabilise Australia\u2019s relationship with the world\u2019s second-largest economy and introduce some form of predictability in trading arrangements.\nBeijing has since abolished most tariffs imposed on Australian exports in 2020-21 after the previous Australian government called for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.\nStill, Australia walks a tightrope in its relationship with China.\nAustralia is reliant on export demand from China, its largest trading partner. But Australia is also a touchstone US ally and part of the Aukus trilateral defence partnership with the US and UK, which will eventually equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.\nPartly as a result, Canberra announced on May 14 plans to dramatically increase defence spending.\n\u201cI have spoken about Australia using all elements of our national power; they should complement each other and work together,\u201d Ms Wong said. \u201cDiplomacy is underwritten by military capability. With all that we do, in all those domains of national power\u2026 Australia always seeks peace, stability and prosperity.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about assuring our interests contribute to the strategic balance or equilibrium in the region,\u201d she added."}
