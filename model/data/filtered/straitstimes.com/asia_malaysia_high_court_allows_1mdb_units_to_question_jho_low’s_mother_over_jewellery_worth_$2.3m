She has 14 days to provide her written reply through an affidavit.\nShould she fail to comply with the order, she will be barred from defending herself in the proceedings, reported The Edge.\nGoh is now unrepresented. The court in November 2022 allowed law firm Messrs Valen, Oh & Partners to discharge itself from representing Goh.\nThis case is part of a broader lawsuit initiated by 1MDB and its subsidiaries to recover millions of dollars from Low, his parents, two siblings and close associate Eric Tan Kim Loong."}
