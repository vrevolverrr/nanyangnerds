By the time of the final harvest, the rice straw yields the portrait of Cooper, the cat on which it was modelled.\nViewing towers are being built in the surrounding area to give visitors a glimpse of the artwork, which is based on a Thai saying, \u201cThere is fish in the water and rice in the fields\u201d.\nThe world\u2019s second-largest exporter of the grain after India, Thailand aims to ship 8.5 million metric tonnes in 2023.\nYoung people wanting to learn more about the interaction of art and technology could also benefit from visiting the site, Mr Tanyapong said.\n\u201cPreviously, rice was considered mainly for consumption,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis approach allows us to develop tourism and agriculture simultaneously.\u201d REUTERS"}
