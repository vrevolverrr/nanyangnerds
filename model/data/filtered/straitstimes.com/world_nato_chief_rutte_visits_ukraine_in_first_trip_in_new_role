Wary of Russia\u2019s response, Ukraine\u2019s allies have held off on making such a move.\nMr Rutte affirmed Nato\u2019s commitment to Ukraine eventually becoming a member.\n\u201cUkraine is closer to Nato than ever before, and it will continue along this path until it secures Nato membership,\u201d he said.\nRussia, which began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, has long opposed Ukraine\u2019s accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.\nMr Rutte voiced strong support for Ukraine on Oct 1 after taking over as Nato chief from Mr Jens Stoltenberg.\nMr Rutte served as prime minister of the Netherlands until earlier in 2024, and was regarded in this role as an ally of Kyiv, approving the transfer of Dutch F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.
