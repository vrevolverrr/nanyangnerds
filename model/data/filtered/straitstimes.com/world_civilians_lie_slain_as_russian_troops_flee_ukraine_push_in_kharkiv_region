We can see that there is almost no distance between the vehicles,\" said \"Filya\", a Ukrainian soldier who guided AFP to the scene.\n\"And obviously they were attacked by gunfire because you can see the bullet holes... One car was set on fire and it's impossible to recognise the people without an expert,\" he said.\nUkrainian troops recaptured Kupyansk - a rail hub once used by the Russians to supply their troops - and a crossing point on the Oskil river in early September after a lightning counteroffensive.\nBut villages like Kyrylivka on the east bank of the Oskil were not secured until four or five days ago, and the slaughtered civilian convoy was close to an area where both sides had fought.\nRussian forces have often been accused of murdering civilians in occupied areas during the seven-month-old war, and on Friday a Russian strike killed 25 civilians in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia.\nBut when Ukrainian forces recaptured eastern Kupiansk they shot up civilian model cars daubed with the Russian occupier's \"Z\" symbol and driven by uniformed men, leaving now bloated bodies by the roadside.\nIn all, AFP reporters counted 11 bodies at the scene, which has yet to be cleared or visited by prosecutors or forensic investigators.\nA short distance away in Kyrylivka, confident Ukrainian forces are now in charge and a thin but steady stream of refugees are filing through on foot towards the bridge across the river and safety.\n'Kamikaze drone'\nSmoke is still curling up from the front left tyre of a Russian APC that Ukrainian troops say was destroyed by a \"kamikaze drone\", and three Russian tanks have been captured more-or-less intact.\nOne, a T-90A, is seen as a great prize.\nThe model entered service in 2004 and is the most modern tank fielded by Russian forces in Ukraine. This one wasn't destroyed, but seems to have been left behind after it was crashed in a ditch."}
