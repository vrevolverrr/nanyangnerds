Rescuers recovered 71 bodies, with one unaccounted person presumed to be dead.\nAnalysis of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder showed that the propellers of both engines went into \u201cfeather in the base leg of descending\u201d, the panel said in a statement.\nAviation expert K.B. Limbu said propellers going into feather means there was \u201cno thrust\u201d in the engine, or that it did not produce any power. REUTERS"}
