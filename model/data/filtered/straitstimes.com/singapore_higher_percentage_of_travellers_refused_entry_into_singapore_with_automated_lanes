Shanmugam said in Parliament that every month, about 2,500 visitors are refused entry at Singapore\u2019s checkpoints for various reasons.\nMr Shanmugam was responding to parliamentary questions about border security measures, which were prompted by the case of extremist Bangladeshi preacher Amir Hamza. He had entered Singapore on Aug 9 and preached to migrant workers at a dormitory here without a permit.\nMs Sun said pre-arrival, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) uses advance passenger information to conduct data analytics and a risk assessment of travellers.\nAll arriving travellers are screened against a watch list of persons of interest, and those flagged by ICA to be of higher risk. They are then stopped for more stringent checks.\nICA\u2019s automated lanes also use biometrics, said Ms Sun.\nShe said: \u201cRepeat travellers, including those who had committed crimes in Singapore, who try to enter via a different identity, will be flagged by our biometric database, because we would have captured their biometrics on their previous visit.\u201d\nMr Shanmugam said Amir Hamza was on the Internal Security Department\u2019s watch list, but he applied for a visa to enter Singapore using a passport with a different name. As this was Amir Hamza\u2019s first visit to Singapore, the authorities did not have his biometrics.\nSaid Mr Shanmugam: \u201cIf he tries to come back again, regardless of what other passport he uses, he will be picked up because we now have his biometrics.\u201d\nMs Sun said that with more automated processes, more ICA officers can be deployed to spot suspicious travellers at the automated immigration lanes.\nSince May, all foreigners arriving in Singapore, regardless of nationality, can use the automated lanes at Changi Airport to clear immigration.\nICA plans to install about 800 such automated lanes across all of Singapore\u2019s checkpoints by 2026.\nMr Leong also asked if the number and percentage of social visit pass holders from China who have been arrested had increased since the 30-day visa exemption arrangement came into force on Feb 9.\nUnder the arrangement, holders of ordinary passports issued by the People\u2019s Republic of China will be exempted from visa requirements for a stay of up to 30 days in Singapore.\nMs Sun said Mr Leong\u2019s question may have been prompted by the recent burglaries allegedly linked to foreign syndicates involving Chinese nationals. Three have been arrested, while another 14 are at large.\nMs Sun said there has been no increase in the number or percentage of short-term visitors from China getting arrested in Singapore since the new arrangement began.\nShe added that visa regimes are not a foolproof way to keep unwanted characters away; neither would they stop these people from committing crimes here.\nThe only way to stop that would be to close our borders to foreigners, but this would destroy the country\u2019s economy, she said."}
