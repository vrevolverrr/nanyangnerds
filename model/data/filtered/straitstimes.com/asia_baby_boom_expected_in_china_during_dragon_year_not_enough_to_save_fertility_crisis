As soon as we signed our papers, I started getting ready,\u201d said the 27-year-old, who lives in Beijing with her 30-year-old husband, an investment manager.\nChina\u2019s birth rate has been on a worrying decline for seven straight years, despite efforts by the government to persuade its young people to have more babies. The Year of the Dragon, however, has traditionally meant a baby bump for the country.\n\u201cAlthough the dragon symbol doesn\u2019t have a personal meaning for either of us, we have been taught from childhood that Chinese people are the descendants of the dragon,\u201d said Ms Ma, who added that she has many friends who are now trying to conceive.\nMajority ethnic Chinese societies, including Singapore and Taiwan, also tend to have baby booms during dragon years, as those born under this zodiac sign are believed to bear desirable traits such as intelligence, leadership and good fortune.\nChina\u2019s birth rate in the last Dragon Year, in 2012, increased from 13.27 per cent the year before to 14.57 per cent, before dipping to 13.03 per cent in 2013.\nExperts say there will also be more babies from couples who had put off getting married or having children during the Covid-19 pandemic, which ended in 2023.\nBut expectations are lower this time around.\n\u201cYes, I think there might be a rise, but it may be very moderate,\u201d said Assistant Professor Mu Zheng, a sociologist who studies China\u2019s fertility at the National University of Singapore.\n\u201cChildbearing is still a big decision, involving extensive considerations. The auspicious connotations of the Year of the Dragon may motivate those who intend to have children to act on it, but for those who are reluctant, it may not be very effective.\u201d\nThe blip will not be enough to reverse the rapid slide in the country\u2019s birth rate, which its leaders have tried to stem with fertility-friendly policies ranging from extended maternity leave to cash rewards.\nIn 2022, China\u2019s population declined for the first time since the 1960s, with India overtaking its lead to become the most populous nation in the world in 2023.\nStatistics released in January 2024 showed its population continuing to dwindle. Deaths outnumbered births by two million in 2023, with just nine million babies born in a country of 1.4 billion people.\nIts total fertility rate is now estimated to be about 1.0, well below the 2.1 that is required to maintain a stable population.\nIt is a crisis that is plaguing other Asian countries, such as South Korea, Singapore and Japan, which have total fertility rates ranging from 0.72 to 1.26.\nChina\u2019s births have plunged in recent years \u2013 dropping dramatically by 50 per cent since 2016, the year after Beijing abandoned its 35-year-old one-child policy, and even after it revised it to a three-child scheme in 2021.\nLast year\u2019s birth rate was just 6.39 per cent, the lowest on record since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949."}
