The local authorities had not reported any damage there as of July 31 morning.\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia.\nKyiv and most of central and eastern Ukraine were under air raid alerts from 2000 GMT on July 30.\nAir defence systems were engaged on the approaches to Kyiv and the region outside the region several times in the night, Mr Popko said.\nReuters reporters heard numerous blasts that sounded like air defence systems engaging targets.
