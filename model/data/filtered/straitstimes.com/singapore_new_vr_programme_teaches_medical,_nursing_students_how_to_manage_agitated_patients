Instead, they learn the appropriate action to take, which will then help them manage real-life scenarios well and avoid threatening consequences for both patients and healthcare workers,\" Prof Goh said.\nWork on the programme started in March 2020, with trials conducted from August 2021 on 65 medical and nursing students.\nThe compulsory programme will be rolled out from next month for fourth-year medicine and second-year nursing students as part of a larger module called Managing Aggression using Immersive Content .\nThe three-hour module also includes a lecture on the theories related to verbal de-escalation and a hands-on workshop on how best to physically restrain patients.\nStudents in the trial said they found the VRAM programme effective.\nSecond-year nursing student Isaac Soh, 22, said: \"The simulation is tactile in the sense that you feel a shake when the patient throws objects at you. In a situation like this, one might freeze up, so the simulation helps me to think on the spot.\"\nAnother second-year nursing student, Miss Chloe Chia, 20, said to avoid getting hurt, students are not allowed to handle agitated patients during their hospital postings.\nSo this programme provides them a safe space to make mistakes without the worry of getting harmed.\n\"The programme allows me to be exposed to things that I cannot be exposed to while still in school. I made a lot of wrong choices on purpose to see what will happen, and to learn from it,\" she added.\nProf Ho said: \"Moving forward, we will see more distressed patients, and healthcare workers need to have an empathetic response while collaboratively making decisions under pressure.\n\"With the blended learning approach, we hope to provide more holistic learning to help future generations of healthcare workers learn the skills of managing agitation while practising empathy and compassion.\""}
