The US is also contracting for more parts under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI).\n\"We're using a number of tools to move funds and accomplish the contracting process quickly,\" the Pentagon said in a statement Tuesday. \"We're focused on acquisition speed, and this is one example of our ability to work quickly with industry to accelerate delivery, by using some existing parts, and contracting under the USAI for additional parts.\"\nZelensky has said that air defence is Ukraine's top priority in the battle against Putin's forces, a call that gained urgency after Russia escalated missile barrages in recent days, including with attacks on the capital Kyiv and other civilian targets.\nIn a call Monday with Zelensky, President Joe Biden said the US would continue providing Ukraine the support it needs, \"including advanced air defence systems\", according to the White House.\nThe White House statement did not specify what systems Biden was talking about, but the exchange highlighted the pressure the US has come under from Ukraine to supply the country with longer-range anti-air and anti-missile systems.\nThe Nasams, developed with Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace of Norway, is one of Nato's most widely used air-defence systems and protects the Washington region. It will be delivered within several weeks, the Pentagon said.\nRaytheon spokesman Chris Johnson said components for the Nasams are made in a number of locations, including Mississippi, California, Arizona and Norway.\nAn additional two systems were put on contract in August but are being built new and will take until 2024 to complete. Four more, to be built at a later date, have also been committed for Ukraine.\nThe Nasams fires AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles - one of the world's most widely sold air-to-air weapons for fighter jets - from ground-mobile canisters.
