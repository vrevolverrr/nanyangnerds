It left him with a small cut above his eyebrow.\n\u201cThe blast wasn\u2019t too loud, but I felt a ringing in my ears afterwards. Some debris flew to the adjacent building,\u201d the Chinese national said in Mandarin.\n\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018How could an explosion like this happen?\u2019 I decided to crouch and then run away from the blast as I feared there would be another explosion.\u201d\nThe incident happened at about 8.55am as Mr Pan was walking on a path by the fence that separates the Audi service centre from the Oxley BizHub building.\nA fire had broken out in the motor room on the ground floor of the building that houses the service centre before a blast sent debris flying in all directions.\nMr Pan, who ran to a nearby bus stop, said: \u201cI was the only person in the immediate vicinity when the blast occurred. A security guard ran over from Oxley BizHub to see what happened.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had been a little closer, the shockwave might have knocked me over. It caught me off guard.\u201d\nAn employee of Cafe Limonci at Oxley BizHub was opening the eatery for business when she heard the blast.\n\u201cI heard and felt the explosion. I thought something large had fallen at first.\n\u201cWhen I stepped outside to take a look, I saw glass shards scattered everywhere,\u201d said the employee, who declined to be named.\nA security guard who works in the same building said he saw flames shooting out from the motor room."}
