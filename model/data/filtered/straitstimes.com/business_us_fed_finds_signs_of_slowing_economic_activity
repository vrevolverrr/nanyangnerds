The remaining six noted \u201cslight declines in activity\u201d.\nAt the same time, \u201cdemand for labour continued to ease\u201d, the Fed said, adding that most districts reported \u201cflat to modest increases in overall employment\u201d.\nRetention appears to have improved in many districts, while some reported reductions in headcounts through layoffs or attrition.\nSome employers even \u201cfelt comfortable letting go low performers\u201d, the Fed said.\nWhile this would normally be concerning for the central bank \u2013 which has a dual mandate to tackle inflation and unemployment \u2013 it comes at a time when the US unemployment rate remains close to historic lows.\nPolicymakers at the Fed have indicated they expect that some softening in the labour market will be required to get US inflation to come down firmly to the 2 per cent target.
