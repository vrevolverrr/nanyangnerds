Announced in 2020, the plan sets the direction for Singapore\u2019s research and development priorities to focus on renewing the country\u2019s commitment to research while scaling up tech innovation capabilities for businesses.\nThe Phase 1 Delta-NTU partnership yielded impressive results that led to about 15 patents and innovative solutions, such as a universal smart navigation system for automated guided vehicles used to transport goods in factories, said Professor Lam Khin Yong, vice-president for industry at NTU.\nThe second phase of research aims to refine and redefine existing robotic capabilities.\nOne area of focus will be to improve the dexterity and flexibility of robots, so that they mimic human movements, and integrate this into each part of the robotic system.\nThis could significantly improve automation within the warehousing, healthcare and service industries.\nFor example, one of the robot grippers integrates touch and force sensors that are flexible, which allows the robot to pick up small and delicate objects, something conventional grippers are still unable to do.\nAnother new device is a robot arm that can be controlled remotely, which could prove useful in unpredictable events with severe consequences, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIt could also increase workplace safety, with workers packing heavy goods by controlling the robot arm from a distance.\nSuch improvements are made possible with novel machine learning methods."}
