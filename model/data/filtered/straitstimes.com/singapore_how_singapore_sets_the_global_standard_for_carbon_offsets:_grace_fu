And not always for the right reasons, with concerns about whether they really do help reduce emissions.\nYet carbon credits can be a useful tool in tackling climate change. Paying investors for every tonne of carbon emissions they take out of the atmosphere or avoid from being emitted can help developing nations ramp up climate action.\nWhat is needed is tougher standards and more careful vetting of carbon offset projects. And Singapore, which is positioning itself as a global hub for carbon offset trading and project financing, is helping drive efforts to boost the quality and integrity of carbon offsets.\nFor instance, the government recently announced the eligibility criteria for carbon offsets that can be used by big polluters under the nation\u2019s carbon tax regime.\nIn this episode, ST\u2019s climate editor David Fogarty hosts Singapore\u2019s Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, to find out more about this.\nHighlights (click/tap above):\n1:05 Why are carbon credits a useful tool and how can they help Singapore meet its climate targets?\n5:26 Yet concerns remain about carbon offsets.
