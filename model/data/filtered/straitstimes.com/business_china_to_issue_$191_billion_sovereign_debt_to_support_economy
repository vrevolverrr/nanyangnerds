These new steps will keep it supportive but not deliver any additional boost.\u201d\nThe world\u2019s second-largest economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, improving the chances that Beijing can meet its growth target of around 5 per cent for 2023. But economists say persistent drag from the property sector still weighs on the economic outlook.\n\u201cIt is rare for the central governments fiscal plans to be revised outside the usual budget cycle, so this move signals clear concern about near-term growth,\u201d Mr Williams said.\nChina has previously let local governments issue bonds ahead of the annual session of Parliament, which approves government budget plans and is usually held in March.\nLocal governments had been told to complete the issuance of the 2023 quota of 3.8 trillion yuan in special local bonds by September to fund infrastructure projects. The government has not disclosed the size of local governments\u2019 2024 front-loaded bond quotas. REUTERS"}
