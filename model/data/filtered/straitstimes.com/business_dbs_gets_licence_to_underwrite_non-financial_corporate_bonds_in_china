It underwrote the first green financial bond issued by a foreign bank.\nIn December 2023, DBS said it obtained the requisite regulatory approvals to increase its stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corporation (SRCB) to 16.69 per cent from 13 per cent.\nThen, the bank said it would acquire Shenzhen Huaqiang Asset Management\u2019s stake of 383.6 million SRCB shares for 5.25 yuan per share.\nAs for its financial results, DBS posted a record full-year net profit of $10.06 billion, up 23 per cent year on year.\nFull-year total income grew 22 per cent to $20.18 billion, also an all-time high, driven by a higher net interest margin, increased fee income and record treasury customer sales. This brings the bank\u2019s full-year return on equity to a record 18 per cent.\nDuring a media briefing on its fourth-quarter results, DBS chief Piyush Gupta said he expects the bank to sustain its underlying profits in a $10 billion range in 2024, notwithstanding headwinds from interest rate changes.\nThe macroeconomic outlook around the world is looking brighter than it did during the bank\u2019s last briefing in November for its third-quarter results, he said.\nSpeaking on his outlook for China, Mr Gupta expects it will remain a challenge as growth stays slow."}
