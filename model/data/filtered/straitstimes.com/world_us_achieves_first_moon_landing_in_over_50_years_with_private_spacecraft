The spacecraft was not designed to provide live video of the landing, which came one day after it reached lunar orbit and a week after its launch from Florida.\nFeb 22\u2019s landing represented the first controlled descent to the lunar surface by a US spacecraft since Apollo 17 in 1972, when Nasa\u2019s last crewed Moon mission landed there with astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.\nTo date, spacecraft from just four other countries have ever landed on the Moon \u2013 the former Soviet Union, China, India and, mostly recently, just in January, Japan. The United States is the only one ever to have sent humans to the lunar surface.\nOdysseus is carrying a suite of scientific instruments and technology demonstrations, for Nasa and several commercial customers, designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the polar landing site.\nThe Nasa payload focuses on space weather interactions with the Moon\u2019s surface, radio astronomy and other aspects of the lunar environment for future landing missions.\nOdysseus was sent on its way to the Moon on Feb 15 atop a Falcon 9 rocket launched by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s company SpaceX from Nasa\u2019s Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nDawn of Artemis\nIts arrival marked the first \u201csoft landing\u201d on the Moon by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle, and the first under Nasa\u2019s Artemis lunar programme, as the US races to return astronauts to Earth\u2019s natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft there.\nNasa aims to land its first crewed Artemis in late 2026 as part of long-term, sustained lunar exploration and a stepping stone towards eventual human flights to Mars. The initiative focuses on the Moon\u2019s south pole, in part because a presumed bounty of frozen water exists there that can be used for life support and the production of rocket fuel.\nA host of small landers like Odysseus is expected to pave the way under Nasa\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme, designed to deliver instruments and hardware to the Moon at lower costs than the US space agency\u2019s traditional method of building and launching those vehicles itself.\nLeaning more heavily on smaller, less experienced private ventures comes with its own risks.\nIn January 2024, the lunar lander of another firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak on its way to the Moon shortly after being placed in orbit on Jan 8 by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket.\nThe malfunction of Astrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lander marked the third failure of a private company to achieve a lunar touchdown, following ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan.\nAlthough Odysseus is the latest star of Nasa\u2019s CLPS programme, the IM-1 flight is considered an Intuitive Machines mission. The company was co-founded in 2013 by Mr Stephen Altemus, former deputy director of Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Centre in Houston and now the company\u2019s president and chief executive. REUTERS"}
