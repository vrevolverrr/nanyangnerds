It calls for a ban on recreational use of cannabis and hefty penalties for offenders.\nThe legislation is being drafted with participation from all stakeholders, Dr Cholnan said.\nThe public and industry stakeholders have until Jan 23 to submit feedback on the Bill.\nMedical marijuana has been legal in Thailand since 2018, but in June 2022, it became the first country in Asia to declassify marijuana as a narcotic.\nThe move came before lawmakers could agree on how to regulate the industry.\nSince then, thousands of weed shops have opened across the country and have been operating in a grey area.\nThey sell various products, from cannabis buds to oil extracts, that contain less than 0.2 per cent tetrahydrocannabinol \u2013 the psychoactive compound that gives users a \u201chigh\u201d sensation.\nBefore the May 2023 election, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin made a pledge during his campaign to restrict the use of marijuana due to concerns over addiction and misuse.\nHis Pheu Thai Party promoted a hardline anti-drug campaign ahead of the polls, vowing to again classify cannabis as a narcotic.\nBut the party is now in a coalition with Bhumjaithai Party, which had spearheaded the move to decriminalise the crop.\nCivil society groups say the definition of recreation in the proposed Bill is still unclear.\nMr Prasittichai Nunual, secretary-general of the Thai Cannabis Future Network, pointed out that the interpretation of what is considered recreational use is based on judgment calls by the authorities.\nHe said the Bill should add a clause giving the right to people to use cannabis in the family based on the knowledge of traditional Thai medicine.\nMr Prasittichai also pointed out that the Bill seems to emphasise taking legal action against those who violate the law, reinforcing a perception that cannabis continues to be seen as a dangerous drug.\nHe said penalties should be similar to those for cigarette or alcohol use.\nThe Bill will be \u201ca compass to set the direction of cannabis in the future in the country, with a principle to preserve its use under Thai traditional medicine wisdom\u201d, Mr Prasittichai said."}
