They were the last of 12 Nasa astronauts to walk on the Moon during a total of six Apollo missions starting in 1969.\nThe Artemis programme, named after the twin sister of Apollo, marks a major turning point for Nasa, redirecting its human spaceflight programme beyond low-Earth orbit after decades focused on space shuttles and the International Space Station.\nRe-entry marked the single most critical phase of Orion\u2019s journey, testing whether its newly designed heat shield can withstand atmospheric friction and safely protect astronauts who would be on board.\n\u201cIt is our priority-one objective,\u201d Nasa\u2019s Mr Sarafin said at a briefing last week. \u201cThere is no arc-jet or aerothermal facility here on Earth capable of replicating hypersonic re-entry with a heat shield of this size.\u201d\nNasa officials have stressed the experimental nature of the Artemis I mission, marking the first launch of the Boeing-built SLS and the first combined with Orion, which previously flew a brief two-orbit test launched on a smaller Delta IV rocket in 2014. The capsule was built by Lockheed Martin.\nCompared with Apollo, born of the Cold War-era US-Soviet space race, Artemis is more science-driven and broad-based, enlisting other countries and commercial partners such as Mr Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and the space agencies of Europe, Canada, and Japan.\nOrion\u2019s European Space Agency (ESA)-supplied service module, a housing for its propulsion system that was jettisoned before the capsule\u2019s descent into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, \u201cperformed beautifully\u201d, ESA\u2019s mission manager Philippe Deloo said in a statement.\n\u201cThis is a great day not only for America, but it\u2019s a great day for all of our international partners \u2013 that\u2019s the difference from 50 years ago,\u201d Mr Nelson said.\nREUTERS"}
