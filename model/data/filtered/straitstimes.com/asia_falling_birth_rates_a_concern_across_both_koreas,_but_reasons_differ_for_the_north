But the cause is starkly different: famine and persistent economic hardship.\nThe communist state\u2019s total fertility rate, the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime, stood at 1.9 in 2022, according to a report titled State Of World Population 2022, published by the United Nations Population Fund.\nThe figure was higher than the South\u2019s 0.78 estimated in the same year. But it is still below the replacement level of 2.1, which would keep its population stable at just under 26 million, the report said.\nNorth Korea saw a gradual fall in births after a catastrophic famine in the mid- and late 1990s, during which about two million people reportedly died from hunger.\nDeclining fertility rates led to an ageing population.\nThe number of North Koreans aged 65 and older accounted for 9.75 per cent in 2022, up 0.1 percentage point from a year earlier, US Central Intelligence Agency data showed. This makes North Korea an \u201cageing society\u201d where the share of the population aged over 65 is above 7 per cent.\nLow births and a fast-ageing population are a worry for the North\u2019s regime, as a shrinking workforce could take a toll on the country\u2019s labour-intensive industries.\nAccording to DPRK Today, a propaganda website for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (the North\u2019s official name), the country has introduced multiple policies to encourage more births, focused on cash grants and affirmative action.\nIt says mothers of three or more children are entitled to priority in receiving medical treatment at local hospitals, as well as government subsidies until their youngest child graduates from high school at the age of 17.\nThey are also allowed to \u201cfreely request\u201d childcare leave if their children are aged 17 or under, according to the website.\nNorth Korean watchers in the South tend to play down the effectiveness of pro-natal policies.\nThis is due to the country\u2019s poor nurturing conditions that have worsened in recent years due to global sanctions for its nuclear and missile programmes, unfavourable weather and border lockdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic."}
