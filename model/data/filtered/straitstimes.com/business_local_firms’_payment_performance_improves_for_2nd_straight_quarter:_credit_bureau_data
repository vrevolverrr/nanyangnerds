Slow payments fell by 0.1 percentage point to 44.2 per cent in the fourth quarter.

Slow payments remained unchanged, while partial payments climbed 0.1 percentage point year on year to 14.8 per cent in the fourth quarter.\nFirms across all sectors registered improvements in slow payments, which is defined as less than 50 per cent of total bills being paid within the agreed terms.\nSuch overall improvement in slow payments occurred for the first time in two years since the fourth quarter of 2021, SCCB\u2019s CEO Audrey Chia noted.\nSlow payments fell further within the construction sector, down 0.08 percentage point quarter on quarter, and by 0.28 percentage point year on year, to 55.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. The heavy construction sector registered the biggest improvement on the quarter.\nIn the manufacturing sector, slow payments dropped 0.1 percentage point in the fourth quarter to 39 per cent after six consecutive quarters of increase, due to a decrease in payment delays by manufacturers of electronics, chemicals and transportation equipment. On the year, however, slow payments among manufacturers jumped by 0.5 percentage point.\nPayment delays in the retail sector also fell further, led by retailers of general merchandise, apparel and accessories and building materials. It slid by 0.04 percentage point quarter on quarter to 43.2 per cent, and by 0.14 percentage point year on year.\nMeanwhile, the services sector continued to register improvements in slow payments, led by decreased payment delays by business, health and consumer services.

The sector\u2019s payment delays fell 0.15 percentage point on the quarter, but increased 0.1 percentage point on the year to 40.4 per cent.\n\u201cOverall, firms have continued to make more prompt payments for the final quarter of 2023.\n\u201cHowever, the average payment delays have continued to increase further, for the second consecutive year in 2023,\u201d Ms Chia added.\nThe annual average proportion of slow payments rose further to 44.24 per cent in 2023 from 44.15 per cent in 2022. Prompt payments decreased to 41 per cent, while partial payments inched up to 14.8 per cent.\n\u201cFirms will have to continue to exercise more prudence in cashflow management and credit control in the months ahead,\u201d said Ms Chia."}
