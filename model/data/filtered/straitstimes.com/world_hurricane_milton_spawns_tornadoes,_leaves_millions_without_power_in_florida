That saved a lot,\u201d Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said during a news conference.\nUS President Joe Biden was briefed on the \u201cinitial impacts\u201d of Milton, the White House said.\nThe series of hurricanes has quickly become an election campaign issue as Republican candidate Donald Trump spreads conspiracy theories claiming Mr Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris are abandoning victims.\nThat prompted a furious response from Mr Biden, who on Oct 9 called Trump \u201creckless, irresponsible\u201d.\nBy the morning of Oct 10, Milton weakened to a Category 1 storm but was still registering powerful winds of up to 140kmh, according to the National Hurricane Centre.\nScientists say extreme rainfall and destructive storms are occurring with greater severity and frequency as temperatures rise due to climate change. As warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapour, they provide more energy for storms as they form.\nMilton struck just two weeks after another major hurricane, Helene, devastated Florida and other south-eastern states, with emergency crews still working to provide relief.\nKilling at least 235 people, Helene was the second-deadliest hurricane to hit the continental US in more than half a century after Katrina, which ravaged the state of Louisiana in 2005, claiming nearly 1,400 lives.\nDespite mass evacuations, pool business owner Randy Prior said he planned to ride out Milton at home, as he was still recovering from Helene.\n\u201cI am nervous. This is something we just went through with the other storm \u2013 ground saturated, still recovering from that,\u201d said Mr Prior, 36.\nIn Sarasota, Ms Elizabeth expressed the feelings of many that despite the violent night, Hurricane Milton was not quite as bad as had been feared.\n\u201cI felt like our building was very secure. So it turned out to be fine, but it was very nerve-racking,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI feel that we\u2019re very lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a long time to clean up, but it could have been much worse. So I feel like we\u2019re lucky.\u201d\nAs at the morning of Oct 10, 2,209 US flights had been cancelled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware, with the highest number of cancellations from Orlando, Tampa and south-west Florida.\nWhile human evacuees jammed the highways and created petrol shortages, animals including African elephants, Caribbean flamingos and pygmy hippos were riding out the storm at Tampa\u2019s zoo.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency had moved millions of gallons of water, millions of meals and other supplies and personnel into the area. None of the additional aid will detract from recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene, the agency\u2019s administrator, Ms Deanne Criswell, said on Oct 9.\nMr DeSantis said on the morning of Oct 10 that crews across the state spent the night clearing debris.\n\u201cOur state is a peninsula in the middle of a tropical environment. I mean, we are just built to be able to respond to hurricanes,\u201d Mr DeSantis said. \u201cWe\u2019ll survey the damage and get people on their feet. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d\nMilton spawned at least 19 tornadoes, the governor said, causing damage in numerous counties and destroying around 125 homes, most of them mobile homes.\nAFP, REUTERS"}
