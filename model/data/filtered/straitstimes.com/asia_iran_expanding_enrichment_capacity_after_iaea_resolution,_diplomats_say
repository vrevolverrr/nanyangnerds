IAEA inspectors observing Iran\u2019s progress plan to issue a report to member states on June 13, three of the diplomats said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as much as I would expect,\u201d one Vienna-based diplomat said, referring to the scale of Iran\u2019s escalation.\n\u201cWhy? I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019re waiting for the new government,\u201d they said, referring to the deaths in a helicopter crash in May of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, and the presidential election due to be held on June 28.\nThe IAEA board passed a resolution a week ago calling on Iran to step up cooperation with the agency and reverse its recent barring of inspectors despite earlier US concerns Tehran would respond with atomic escalation. Only Russia and China opposed it.\nDiplomats did not go into specifics on the number or type of centrifuges being added or what level they would enrich to, though one diplomat said they would not be used to quickly expand Iran\u2019s production of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent, close to the 90 per cent of weapons grade.\nThe diplomats said they would wait to see what the IAEA said Iran had actually done but they were aware of Iran\u2019s plans.\nThe move is \u201cat the lower end of expectations and something we\u2019re pretty sure they were going to do anyway\u201d, one diplomat said, meaning it would have happened even without the resolution.\nIran did not fully follow through on its November 2022 announcement after the previous resolution. While it installed all the centrifuges that it said it would at its underground enrichment plant at Natanz, 12 cascades of one advanced model, the IR-2m, are not yet in operation.\nIran is only enriching to up to 60 per cent at an above-ground pilot plant at Natanz and its Fordow site, which is dug into a mountain. In November 2022, it started enriching to up to 60 per cent at Fordow but it has yet to install all the additional cascades it said it would. REUTERS"}
