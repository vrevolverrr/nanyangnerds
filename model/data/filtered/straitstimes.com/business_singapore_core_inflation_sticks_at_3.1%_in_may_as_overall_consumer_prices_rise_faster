It was up 0.3 per cent in April.\nBoth inflation measures came in slightly higher than forecast. A Reuters poll of economists tipped core inflation at 3 per cent and headline inflation at 3.05 per cent.\nOn a month-on-month basis, which represents how much momentum there still is in prices, core inflation edged up 0.1 per cent in May, while headline inflation went up by 0.7 per cent.\nDBS economist Chua Han Teng said core disinflation, or the reduction in the rate of core inflation, is still on track.\nDespite year-on-year core inflation remaining steady, the month-on-month annualised change on a three-month moving average basis trended lower in May than the February 2024 peak, he said.\nMr Chua expects average core inflation to cool in 2024 as imported price pressures are contained due to manageable global commodity prices, and with the Singapore dollar staying strong.\nOCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said that at this juncture, the last-mile disinflation trajectory remains somewhat bumpy, but it is not unique to Singapore.\nShe said there is room for both core and headline inflation to go below the 3 per cent level in the coming months to average around 2.8 per cent and 3 per cent for 2024.\nCentral banks around the world are keeping a close watch on inflation.\nThe European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank have started to cut their policy rates, the Bank of England is sending dovish signals, while the United States Federal Reserve is in a wait-and-see mode but has pencilled in one cut in 2024, with four tentative cuts each in 2025 and 2026.\nSaid Ms Ling: \u201cFor the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the bar to a further monetary policy tightening is relatively high, while the time for an easing may also be some time away given the downward sticky core inflation prints. Our baseline view is no change to MAS\u2019 monetary policy stance for the July meeting and the October meeting as well.\u201d"}
