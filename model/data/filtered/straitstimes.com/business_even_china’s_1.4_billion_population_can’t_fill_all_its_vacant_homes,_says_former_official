Each expert gives a very different number, with the most extreme believing the current number of vacant homes to be enough for three billion people,\u201d said Mr He Keng, 81, a former deputy head of the statistics bureau.\n\u201cThat estimate might be a bit much, but 1.4 billion people probably can\u2019t fill them,\u201d Mr He said at a forum in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan, according to a video released by the official media outlet China News Service.\nHis negative view of the economically significant sector at a public forum stands in sharp contrast to the official narrative that the Chinese economy is \u201cresilient\u201d.\n\u201cAll sorts of comments predicting the collapse of China\u2019s economy keep surfacing every now and then, but what has collapsed is such rhetoric, not China\u2019s economy,\u201d a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said at a recent news conference.
