Greater transparency will help to improve confidence in carbon markets, which is something the markets are struggling with amid concerns about the quality of carbon credits.\n\u201cWithin 12 months, we managed to onboard six registries, and the six registries represent 85 per cent of carbon credits issued to date,\u201d said Mr Chia.\nThe six include Verra, the world\u2019s largest carbon credit issuer for the voluntary carbon market, Qatar-based Global Carbon Council and the Kingdom of Bhutan.\nThe aim is to expand this by bringing on board most of the large independent registries by the end of June, Mr Chia added.\nThere are at least 26 carbon credit registries in the world, each with its own system of tracking the issuance, transfer and retirement of carbon credits from various project developers. Registries can be operated by governments, non-profit organisations or private companies.\nDiscussions are ongoing with Gold Standard in Geneva, and three United States-based groups: the American Carbon Registry, Architecture for Redd+ Transactions and Climate Action Reserve.\nNational registries, many of which are still in development, will also be brought on board over time, Mr Chia said.\nCAD Trust\u2019s purpose is to improve transparency in the often opaque world of carbon credit trading by tracking the full life cycle of carbon credits \u2013 from the projects that generate the credits, to who buys them and who finally \u201cretires\u201d them by using the credits to offset their carbon footprint.\nThe retirement of carbon credits takes them out of circulation, preventing the same credit from being claimed by more than one party.\nEach carbon credit represents one tonne of planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) that is either removed from the atmosphere \u2013 such as through technology that directly removes CO2 from the air \u2013 or prevented from being emitted, such as when a forest is saved from the axe.\nEmitters can meet their climate change targets, such as the goal to taper planet-warming emissions to net zero by the middle of the century, by buying credits from carbon projects around the world and counting the emissions savings from those projects as their own.\nAs many carbon projects tend to be located in developing countries, the revenue from carbon credits also helps to channel investments into climate-friendly projects in these areas.\nBut the diversity of carbon credit registries makes it difficult to ensure that the same carbon credit is not counted twice, since each credit could be cross-listed on multiple registries.\nWhat CAD Trust does is to link, aggregate and harmonise the data from major carbon credit registries using blockchain technology. This provides an integrated platform that will improve transparency of the market, and increase trust and confidence that the global trade in carbon credits truly benefits the climate, said Mr Chia.\nTo help visualise the data, CAD Trust also developed an interactive data dashboard. This took a year to develop and was launched during the COP28 United Nations climate change conference in Dubai in December 2023.\nThe dashboard allows users to track carbon offsets generated by more than 17,300 projects approved by the six registries.\nCAD Trust executive director Dinesh Babu said: \u201cCAD Trust is unique. Nobody has attempted to do this before.\u201d\nUsers can track where the credit is, where it originated, who is holding the offset right now and what purpose it is being used for.\nMr Chia, one of CAD Trust\u2019s three board members, said: \u201cThat injects transparency in the market, and we feel that transparency is absolutely critical if you want carbon markets to work well.\u201d\nBut the US$2 billion (S$2.7 billion) carbon market has been overshadowed in recent years by criticism about poor-quality offsets from projects that failed to achieve the emissions reductions as planned, double counting and limited co-benefits, such as excluding local communities from a protected forest or monoculture forest plantations having no beneficial biodiversity outcome.\nGoing forward, the market is set to focus more on high-integrity offsets that have clear climate, social and biodiversity benefits.\n\u201cIt is becoming increasingly important that credits, when they are being generated, result in benefits that flow through more widely,\u201d said Mr Chia.\nThe issues of transparency and integrity are only going to become more important as the carbon market expands, he noted.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries are allowed to buy carbon credits to meet their national climate pledges.\nThis means that other than taking steps to cut emissions within their borders, such as by investing in renewable energy infrastructure, countries can purchase carbon credits generated elsewhere and count these savings towards their target.\nCountries can either purchase these credits from another country through a bilateral agreement or buy them from a new carbon credit market administered by the UN. The mechanisms for this UN market are still being negotiated but could be finalised in the next year or two.\n\u201cYou have credits generated by different registries, which are then transferred to maybe a private sector company, transferred to a country, and they move all over the place. This underlines the importance of CAD Trust because it shines a light and makes it very transparent where all the credits are flowing and being used within this more diverse landscape,\u201d said Mr Chia.\nLeading market participants ST spoke to said CAD Trust is playing an important role.\n\u201cCAD Trust has had a good start,\u201d said Mr Law Heng Dean, managing director at Pollination, an international climate change investment and advisory firm, and co-leader of its Singapore office.\n\u201cGoing forward, CAD Trust will need to get more national registries on board \u2013 especially those from major demand and host countries \u2013 to be more effective.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAll of us will benefit if it works as intended in building trust in carbon markets, the lack of which is a challenge that all of us operating in those markets can face at this point in time.\u201d\nMr Duncan van Bergen, co-founder of carbon credit ratings company Calyx Global, said: \u201cThe transparency and interoperability that CAD Trust is creating between registries is another key building block towards a more accessible and scalable global carbon market.\u201d\nFunding for the platform remains a question mark. Mr Chia said that as the service is a public good, it must remain free. The Government has helped fund CAD Trust from the start and continues to provide support, he added.\n\u201cWe need to demonstrate that the product is valuable. And we also need to work with different stakeholders to see how best they are able to support this platform,\u201d said Mr Chia, adding that these stakeholders could include foundations and other governments.\nMr Dinesh said he is in discussions with potential funders. He said CAD Trust had received a grant from Google.org, the charitable arm of Google, to help fund early development of the platform, and he is looking for similar support from other foundations and governments.\nHe also pointed to the strong interest in the platform, with the data dashboard receiving 730,000 visits since its launch in December 2023. The top five source countries for visitors are the US, Britain, Singapore, India and Canada.\nThis reflects the strong international interest in Asia and Singapore because of growing investment in carbon credit projects, especially nature-based projects, in this region, he added."}
