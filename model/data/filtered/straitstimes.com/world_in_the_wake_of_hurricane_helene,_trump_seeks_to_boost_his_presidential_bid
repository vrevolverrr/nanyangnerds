Ms Harris is also Mr Biden\u2019s vice-president.\nTrump said he brought \u201ctruckloads of things\u201d to Georgia, including oil, water and equipment, and that he partnered evangelical Christian leader Franklin Graham\u2019s relief organisation to deliver them.\nNatural disasters have damaged US administrations in the past and Trump is trying to tie Ms Harris to this hurricane, which tore through the US South-east including the battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina, said Professor Andrew Reeves from Washington University in St Louis who has studied how natural disasters affect US politics.\n\u201cIf there is a massive screw-up in the response, it could come back to bite her,\u201d Prof Reeves said. \u201cTrump is trying to look presidential and trying to create a media story around his attention to the crisis.\u201d\nGeorgia and North Carolina will play a key role in the outcome of the Nov 5 election between Trump and Ms Harris. North Carolina\u2019s hardest-hit area, Buncombe County, voted for Mr Biden in 2020, while most of the other counties in the western part of the state picked Trump.\nGeorgia\u2019s Lowndes County, where Valdosta is located, voted for Trump in 2020. But even a few thousand votes in each state could decide which presidential candidate wins those states and potentially determine the outcome of the White House race.\nMore than 3,500 federal workers are involved in response efforts in the affected states, according to the White House.\nAnalysts said it was abnormal for a presidential candidate who is not in office to visit a disaster area.\nNatural disasters, especially hurricanes, have shaped US politics in recent years and could alter the course of the race in 2024 as well, said Mr Stuart Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.\n\u201cIt gives Donald Trump an opportunity to ride into the rescue as the savior,\u201d he said.\nIt is not the first time Trump has sought to use a disaster for political gain. While visiting the site of a toxic train derailment in Ohio in 2023, he criticised the Biden administration\u2019s response as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d.\nPresidents and presidential candidates usually do not visit a storm-hit region immediately because of fears that they will distract from rescue efforts and drain resources from local law enforcement officials and emergency responders.\nMr Biden said he would visit North Carolina on Oct 2, and Georgia and Florida soon after. He may also ask Congress to return to Washington for a special session to pass supplemental aid funding.\nMs Harris is planning a visit to Augusta, Georgia, on Oct 2 and a trip to North Carolina in the coming days, the White House said.\nShe spoke with local leaders by phone and cut short a West Coast campaign swing to participate in a hastily arranged briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters on Sept 30. There, she grimaced and shook her head when a reporter asked whether the crisis was being politicised. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Oct 1.\nTrump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \u201cWhile Biden and Harris abandon Americans in times of crisis, President Trump leads.\u201d\nThe storm killed more than 100 people across North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia, and the death toll is expected to rise.\nSurvivors will be eligible for federal disaster aid, but Trump has also authorised a GoFundMe fund-raising campaign \u201cas an official response for Maga supporters\u201d. The campaign has raised over US$2 million (S$2.58 million) so far. Maga refers to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan.\nMs Leavitt declined to say how the funds will be spent.\nIn 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay US$2 million for misusing his namesake charitable foundation, resulting in funds being used to advance his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump defended the charity at the time, saying it was an \u201cincredibly effective philanthropy\u201d that had made \u201csome small technical violations\u201d.\nIn Georgia, Trump falsely claimed that Mr Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, \u201cwas having a hard time\u201d getting Mr Biden on the phone.\nMr Kemp told reporters that the President had called him the evening before and said he was grateful for the federal assistance Mr Biden had offered. Mr Biden said Trump had been lying.\nProf Reeves\u2019 research has found that sitting presidents received a modest bump of half a percentage point when they approved disaster aid close to their re-election.\nDuring Trump\u2019s 2017 visit to San Juan, Puerto Rico, after Hurricane Maria, the then President threw rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents impacted by the storm. The move drew criticism from some local officials.\nWhile campaigning for re-election in 2012, President Barack Obama joined Republican Governor Chris Christie to tour parts of New Jersey that were affected by Superstorm Sandy. Mr Christie was at the time a top defender of Mr Obama\u2019s Republican rival, Mr Mitt Romney.\nRepublican President George W. Bush\u2019s approval ratings fell after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 and never recovered.\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres said disasters can be make-or-break events for office-holders, but not necessarily for candidates. \u201cCandidates have no responsibility for handling major disasters,\u201d he said.
