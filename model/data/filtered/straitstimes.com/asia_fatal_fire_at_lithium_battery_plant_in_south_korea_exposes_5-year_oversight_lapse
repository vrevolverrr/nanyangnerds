They consider the incident a disaster caused by comprehensive negligence rather than isolated factors.\nHead of the Labour Ministry\u2019s special investigation team Min Gil-soo said at the June 28 briefing that the government had completed work to prevent further damage. The explanation given was that the \u201cdisposal of the waste electrolyte, which was left on the first floor of the affected building, was safely completed to prevent additional harm\u201d.\nThe electrolyte used in the batteries, which facilitates the movement of electrons between the cathode and anode in batteries, was highly flammable and could pose a significant risk.\nIt was also confirmed that the remains of all 23 victims had been identified as at June 28. The final DNA results confirmed the identities of 17 Chinese nationals, five Koreans and one Laotian among the dead, according to Mr Min.\nChinese Consul-General Zhong Hongnuo on June 28 visited the memorial altar at Hwaseong City Hall to pay his respects to the victims. After that, he had a brief meeting with Hwaseong Mayor Jeong Myeong-geun to discuss the incident and extend support to the grieving families.\nAfter the meeting, Mr Zhong said: \u201cWe will assist the bereaved families in managing the aftermath of the accident and work with the relevant departments of the Korean government to ensure proper compensation is provided.\u201d\nHe further told reporters: \u201cWe hope the Korean government will promptly investigate the cause of the fire and thoroughly explain the findings to the families, implementing effective measures to prevent future incidents.\u201d\nMr Zhong also emphasised: \u201cWe must value and protect the lives and property of all workers, including Chinese nationals, and take steps to prevent such tragedies from happening again.\u201d THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK"}
