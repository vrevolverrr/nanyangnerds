The number of people with kidney failure here has gone up by 40 per cent over the past 10 years.\nCurrently, more than 470,000 adults in the Republic live with diabetes, and about half of them have CKD.\nWith the number of Singapore adults with diabetes projected to double to one million by 2050, doctors here want to be able to detect CKD early to manage it effectively.\n\u201cWhen you look at (patients with) Stage 5 or end-stage kidney failure among all the dialysis patients, about 70 per cent have diabetes as the underlying contributing factor.\n\u201cWhen they reach Stage 5, the lifespan is shortened by up to 16 years,\u201d Prof Bee said.\n\u201cIn terms of the trend from 2010 to 2019, we see a large increase in the prevalence of end-stage kidney disease. I think part of this is because our diabetes patients are surviving longer with better treatments,\u201d he added.\nDr Andrew Wu, chief executive of Mesh Bio, a health technology start-up focusing on the digital transformation of care delivery, said: \u201cWe believe this technology will be instrumental in reducing the burden of diabetes complications and advancing personalised care strategies.\u201d\nUsing data from two hospitals and selected polyclinics under SingHealth and NHG, Mesh Bio developed HealthVector Diabetes, the world\u2019s first foundational digital twin model of human biology.\nThe metabolic digital twin software uses data analysis and artificial intelligence to predict the risk of CKD onset in diabetes patients over three years.\nAt present, patients with diabetes need to be monitored for diabetic kidney disease through yearly blood and urine tests, as early kidney disease usually does not have any symptoms. Testing is the only way to know how well the kidneys are working.\nData of 7,000 patients from SGH, TTSH and selected polyclinics was assessed to derive a risk score to predict worsened kidney function.\nUsing information such as fasting blood sugar levels, cholesterol measurements, body mass index and blood pressure, the software estimates the three-year risk for CKD development in Type 2 diabetes patients who do not have pre-existing kidney issues.\nAssociate Professor Rinkoo Dalan, an endocrinologist at TTSH, a member of NHG, said that work done using HealthVector Diabetes has shown that the predictions of the software outperformed other prediction models such as the annual blood and urine tests.\nThe study into the development and validity of HealthVector Diabetes was published in npj Digital Medicine journal in May 2024.\n\u201c(From there), we developed this algorithm further and subsequently fine-tuned and validated it by adding the SingHealth diabetes registry,\u201d Prof Bee said.\nProf Rinkoo said the improved software can potentially transform the care of patients with diabetes, as doctors use the information to prioritise and intensify treatments to delay the progression of kidney failure.\nOnce the pilot programme is launched in early 2025, Prof Rinkoo said its predictions will allow doctors to create personalised treatment for sugar and blood pressure control, which will in turn delay the onset or progression of CKD and its complications.\n\u201cThis way, patients with diabetes will have an additional 15 years free from having to deal with end-stage kidney failure, and will have a better quality of life,\u201d she added."}
