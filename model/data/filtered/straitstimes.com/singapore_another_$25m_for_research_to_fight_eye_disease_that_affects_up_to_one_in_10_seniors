The condition can make it difficult for patients to read, recognise faces or drive safely. It is one of the leading causes of blindness affecting those 50 years or older, in Singapore and worldwide.\nAbout 5 per cent to 7 per cent of people aged 40 and above in Singapore have this disease in varying degrees of severity. For those aged 70 and above, AMD can affect up to one in every 10 people.\nBy 2040, AMD is projected to affect 288 million people across the world, of which 113 million are in Asia.\nSeri\u2019s AMD programme concluded its first phase at the end of July. During this phase of their research, the team discovered new genes linked to AMD.\nProf Cheung said the research team will study how these genes affect the body\u2019s metabolism and how other factors, including environmental ones, contribute to the development of AMD.\nThe team is working with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) on developing an antibody that can block a chemical substance which is elevated in individuals with AMD.\nThe new injection of funds for the programme will go towards the work in the second phase, which will focus on the development of earlier detection methods and better treatments.\nThere are four key areas in phase two of the programme \u2013 personalised treatment strategies, identification of high-risk individuals, development of better diagnostic tools and the study of the new genes linked to the development of AMD.\nWorking together with Seri and SNEC in the second phase are A*Star, Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital.\nAMD patients typically receive eye injections to treat the condition. Patients can expect about six to nine such injections in the first year of treatment, followed by three to four every year thereafter.\nProf Cheung said the team is developing new treatments that last longer and can cater to patients with varying degrees of severity of AMD.\nThe team also hopes to focus on early detection and preventive intervention in high-risk individuals in the community.\nProf Cheung said risk factors include smoking or having a family history of AMD. But these explain only a small proportion of cases.\nWhile there is no cure for AMD, early diagnosis and treatment can help preserve more vision by preventing permanent tissue damage.\nSeri is teaming up with SingHealth to screen patients for AMD in community hospitals from early 2025. They hope to find 300 people with early AMD and monitor them for symptoms of advanced AMD over three to five years.\nOther than a dim, blurry spot in one\u2019s vision, symptoms also include crooked vision (straight lines appearing wavy) or patchy loss of vision.\nA common complication that can occur in the later stages of AMD is fibrosis \u2013 the formation of scar tissue in the eye. It occurs in an estimated 50 per cent of patients with AMD.\nMadam Sng, who works as a sales promoter, has received six intravitreal injections since August 2023 and is scheduled for another in November. She said the injections were painless and that the blurry spot she used to see is now gone.\n\u201cThis disease is no joke. If you detect any blurry spot in your vision, it is best to get it checked as early as possible. Now I am fine and I can see things clearly,\u201d she added.\nProf Cheung noted that there is a lack of public awareness about the disease in many Asian countries, including Singapore, although there has been progress in recent years.\n\u201cDistortion and patchy vision may be early symptoms. Delaying until there is severe blurring can lead to worse outcomes even with treatment,\u201d she added.\nSNEC is organising an upcoming webinar on Oct 12 for the public to learn more about AMD.\nFor more information, visit str.sg/rEmQ"}
