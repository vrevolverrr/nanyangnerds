We have since made a police report.\u201d\nMOH said that, notwithstanding its apology, the allegations published by WUSG are serious and have been circulated to various other platforms. \u201cThis could lead to the erosion of public trust in the credibility and professionalism of our healthcare system and institutions.\u201d\nUnder the correction direction, WUSG is required to publish correction notices as specified by the Pofma Office for each webpage and social media post containing the falsehoods.\nWUSG published the correction notices shortly after MOH\u2019s statement was put out, at 12.24am on Facebook and subsequently on Instagram.\nOn Saturday afternoon, WUSG sought to provide an account of how it had come to publish the allegations, and published more than 50 screenshots that it said documented its exchanges with the pregnant woman.\n\u201cWe are sorry to our readers and the good people of KKH. We will face the consequences of our actions and take responsibility,\u201d it said. \u201cAs mentioned yesterday, we will co-operate with investigations and do what is necessary.\u201d\nMOH said: \u201cThe Government takes a serious view of these falsehoods, which appear to have been fabricated. The matter has been referred to the relevant authorities for investigation.\u201d"}
