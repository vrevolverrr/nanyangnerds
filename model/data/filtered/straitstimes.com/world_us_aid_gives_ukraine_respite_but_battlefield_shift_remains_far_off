(S$81.67 billion) in aid throws a lifeline to Ukraine\u2019s beleaguered military, though it is unlikely to turn the tide in the war on its own.\nMuch will depend on how quickly US assistance can get to the front line after the House of Representatives approved the military and economic assistance on April 20.\nAs the package was stalled for six months in Congress, Kyiv\u2019s military has grappled with an ever-more acute shortage of ammunition and manpower, while Kremlin forces press their advantage.\nThe aid offers a respite to Ukraine\u2019s military and will help it slow the Kremlin\u2019s advances, conduct an \u201ceffective defence\u201d and minimise losses, according to Mr Mykola Bielieskov, research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kyiv.\nBut more aid is needed to go further, he said, a difficult prospect in the US with Republican resistance in Congress.\n\u201cThe question is whether there will be aid and in what volume in 2025 and beyond \u2013 as Putin\u2019s strategy is to wait it out,\u201d he added.\nRussia has escalated its barrages of missile and drone attacks as the war crossed over into a third year, decimating swathes of Ukraine\u2019s power-generating infrastructure and destroying residential buildings in city centres.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the US legislation, which should clear further hurdles this week, will bolster his military.\n\u201cWe did lose the initiative,\u201d Mr Zelensky told NBC\u2019s Meet The Press on April 21. \u201cNow we have all the chance to stabilise the situation and to overtake the initiative.\u201d\nThe legislation is set to make it to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk this week after the Senate takes up the package as soon as April 23.\nThe US Defence Department could get weapons moving to Ukraine \u201cvery quickly\u201d once the aid flows, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said last week.\nMs Oksana Markarova, Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to the US, said on April 19 that delivery logistics have been in the works all along.\n\u201cThe Pentagon and our Defence Ministry didn\u2019t stop working daily together at finding weapons, identifying them and such packages are being prepared,\u201d Ms Markarova told Ukrainian television.\nSome of the equipment, which will likely include longer-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, could be on the way by the end of the week, Democrat Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CBS\u2019s Face The Nation.\nElsewhere, Germany will keep pressing European allies this week, including France and Italy, to supply air defence systems and components for Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.\nBerlin, which has also been urging Nato countries to figure out what they can send, has committed to providing Ukraine with a third Patriot battery as well as other systems and ammunition.\nPainful shortages in weapons and manpower along the 1,200km front, along with a dire need for more air defence systems, have pushed Ukraine\u2019s fighting forces close to a breaking point, raising the risk of a Russian breakthrough.\nMoscow has also escalated its bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, in what Ukrainian and Western officials see as a bid to force an evacuation of the city, less than an hour\u2019s drive from the Russian border.\n\u2018Seriously damaged\u2019\nEven if US material moves quickly, transport logistics will likely mean the aid \u201cwill not begin to affect the situation on the front line for several weeks\u201d, according to analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War.\n\u201cThe front-line situation will therefore likely continue to deteriorate in that time, particularly if Russian forces increase their attacks to take advantage of the limited window before the arrival of new US aid,\u201d the analysts said.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces, seeking to benefit from the widening gap in ammunition supplies, have ratcheted up their firepower all along the front, and made marginal gains since capturing the eastern city of Avdiivka in February.\nKremlin troops are focusing on strategically key spots, such as the town of Chasiv Yar, west of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, as they currently out-gun Ukraine\u2019s army in artillery on the battlefield 10-to-one.\n\u201cThe Ukrainians have been seriously damaged, and their armed forces are weaker than they would have been otherwise,\u201d Professor Phillips O\u2019Brien, a strategic studies expert at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, wrote after the US House vote. \u201cAt least now, however, with a major infusion of US aid, the Ukrainians should be able to stabilise the line.\u201d\nIn contrast with a year ago, when spring weather brought with it hopes for a successful counter-offensive by well-armed Ukrainian forces, the failure of that campaign and dwindling assistance from allies in the months since have darkened the public mood.\nMr Zelensky signalled that there is no time to lose after the package is disbursed, with Ukrainian and US officials in continuous contact to ensure the deliveries are made.\n\u201cThe time between political decision and real hitting of the enemy on the front line must be as short as possible,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said in his regular address to the nation on April 21. \u201cNow, every day matters.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
