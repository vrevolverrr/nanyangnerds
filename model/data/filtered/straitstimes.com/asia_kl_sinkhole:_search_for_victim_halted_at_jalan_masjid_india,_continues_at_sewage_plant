Datuk Seri Anwar, during a visit to Penang, told reporters that a geotechnical study had established the cause of the incident and found that it was safe.\nHe said that any areas considered at risk of turning into sinkholes should be dealt with right away, adding that Dr Zaliha should monitor those areas closely."}
