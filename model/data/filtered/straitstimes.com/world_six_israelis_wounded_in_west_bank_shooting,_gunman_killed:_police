He said he saw a man wearing a yellow vest and holding a pistol.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he was the terrorist,\u201d the officer, whose identity was not revealed, said in a video released by police.\n\u201cI yelled at him to stop and cocked my gun. He began firing at me, and I realised he was the terrorist.\u201d\nPolice said the officer then managed to shoot the gunman dead in return fire.\nIsrael has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967.\nExcluding annexed East Jerusalem, the territory is home to nearly three million Palestinians and around 490,000 Israelis who live in settlements considered illegal under international law.\nThe Palestinians, who seek their own independent state, want Israel to withdraw from all land it occupied in the Six-Day War and to dismantle all Jewish settlements.\nHowever, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who took power in December in a coalition between his Likud party and extreme-right and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies, has pledged to \u201cstrengthen settlements\u201d.\nHe has expressed no interest in reviving peace talks, which have been moribund since 2014.\nSeparate incident\nIsrael\u2019s hardline Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who himself lives in a settlement, praised the officer who killed the gunman and also the government policy to distribute weapons to citizens.\nIt \u201cis an important policy that proves itself\u201d, he said after visiting the site of the attack.\n\u201cI think that (distributing weapons) to this combination of citizens, border policemen, fighters, policemen who defend the state of Israel is the right combination,\u201d Mr Ben-Gvir said.\nSince being appointed in December, Mr Ben-Gvir has worked to streamline the licensing process for private guns in Israel to enable people who meet the country\u2019s strict criteria to bear arms.\nIn a separate incident later on Tuesday in the southern West Bank, soldiers questioned a Palestinian who aroused their suspicion at a bus stop.\n\u201cThe suspect attempted to stab them. One of the soldiers neutralised the assailant,\u201d the army said in a statement, sharing a picture of a knife.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said Mohammad Farid al-Zaarir, 15, was shot dead in the incident.\nViolence linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has in 2023 killed at least 205 Palestinians, 27 Israelis, one Ukrainian and one Italian, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources on both sides.\nThey include, on the Palestinian side, combatants as well as civilians and, on the Israeli side, three members of the Arab minority.
