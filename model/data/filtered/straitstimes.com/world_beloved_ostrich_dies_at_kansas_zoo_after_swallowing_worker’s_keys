She did not immediately respond to requests for further information and an interview on April 22.\nThe zoo said on social media that it had conducted an investigation into the episode and was \u201ctaking appropriate actions regarding the team member involved\u201d. The zoo will also establish new protocols to avoid similar occurrences in the future, it said.\nOstriches, while flightless, are known for their impressive speeds: A frightened bird can run about 72.4kmh and, if cornered, can deliver fatal kicks to predators. They can live to about 40 years old in the wild and longer in captivity.\n\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of Karen,\u201d Ms Moser said in the social media post.\n\u201cShe was not just an animal,\u201d she added, \u201cshe was a beloved member of our community.\u201d NYTIMES"}
