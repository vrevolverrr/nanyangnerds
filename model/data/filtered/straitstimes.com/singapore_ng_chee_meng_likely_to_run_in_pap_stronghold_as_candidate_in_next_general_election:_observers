Bukit Batok\u2019s sitting MP, Mr Murali Pillai from the PAP, was also at the event.\nHowever, Mr Ng told reporters on April 25 that people should not \u201cread too much\u201d into the event, and that such appearances are part of NTUC\u2019s regular groundwork.\nA Cabinet minister has traditionally held the post of NTUC secretary-general. The practice began with Mr Lim Chee Onn, who was the first labour chief to be appointed minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in 1980.\nMr Ng \u2013 who has been NTUC secretary-general since 2018 \u2013 is the first labour chief in decades who is not also a sitting MP.\n\u201cDespite not being a current PAP MP, his continuing as NTUC secretary-general in the past four years indicates that the ruling party leadership has significant plans for him should he be elected,\u201d said Singapore Management University associate professor of law Eugene Tan.\n\u201cThe symbiotic relationship between the PAP and NTUC makes it imperative for Mr Ng to be elected if he is to continue as the labour chief.\u201d\nProf Tan added: \u201cThere are options for the PAP as to where he could be fielded, but it is unlikely he will be fielded in an SMC and even more unlikely to be fielded again in Sengkang GRC.\u201d\nObservers suggested that Mr Ng is likely to be fielded in a PAP stronghold instead.\nDr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore, said that as Mr Ng is seen as being a member of the 4G team, there is a high likelihood that he may be fielded in one of the safer GRCs for the coming election.\nWith Mr Ng being spotted in Bukit Batok, one possibility is that he may lead the Jurong GRC team, which is without an anchor minister after Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam stepped down in June 2023 to contest, and subsequently win, the presidential election.\nWhile they are separate constituencies, both Bukit Batok and the five-member Jurong GRC come under Jurong-Clementi Town Council, together with the single seat of Yuhua.\nIn the 2020 General Election, a PAP team led by Mr Tharman secured almost 75 per cent of the vote in Jurong GRC \u2013 the highest of any electoral constituency.\nIn contrast, in Bukit Batok SMC, Mr Murali scraped a win with 54.8 per cent of the votes.\nBased on the 2020 General Election results, Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, Ang Mo Kio GRC and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC are also relatively safe seats for the PAP, noted Prof Tan.\nThe PAP secured 64.16 per cent of the vote in Pasir Ris-Punggol, 67.23 per cent in Bishan-Toa Payoh, and 71.91 per cent in Ang Mo Kio, where Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is anchor minister.\nProf Tan added: \u201cMr Ng was an MP in Pasir Ris-Punggol between 2015 and 2020, so he would still be fairly familiar to voters there. He could also be regarded as the possible successor to PM Lee in Ang Mo Kio GRC... (otherwise he could be) portrayed as the new anchor in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC should Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen not contest or relinquish his anchor role.\u201d\nThis week, when The Straits Times visited some of the constituencies where Mr Ng could be fielded, residents said it will be an uphill task for the NTUC secretary-general to replace former or current MPs who have served the community for a long time.\nResidents and merchants at shops and eateries in Bukit Batok spoke effusively of how Mr Murali \u2013 who has been serving the single seat ward since the 2016 by-election \u2013 is a consistent presence and a friendly one.\nAmong them was actor Ebi Shankara, 36, who lived in Bukit Batok for most of his life and still visits family in the area on a regular basis.\nHe described Mr Murali as \u201cmild-mannered, amiable and someone who is always in touch with the people\u201d, whether or not it is election season.\nA resident who wanted to be known only as Mr Lim, 66, said: \u201cHe comes around (the neighbourhood) quite a lot, so I appreciate it, because I have been staying here for over 30 years.\u201d\nOther Bukit Batok residents, like a retiree who wanted to be known only as Mr Tang, 65, welcomed the idea of a new face like Mr Ng.\n\u201cI think the Government needs him (to run) because he is a workhorse. They need people to do the work, and it\u2019s not just about managing the estate,\u201d said Mr Tang.\n\u201cHe is probably someone up and coming, and (the PAP) needs people, because the older ministers are tired after Covid-19,\u201d he added.\nIn Jurong GRC\u2019s Taman Jurong ward, where President Tharman was formerly MP, residents and stallholders were happy for Mr Tharman\u2019s success in the presidential election, but believe his successor will have big shoes to fill.\nMadam Fatimah Begum Sikander, 50, said Mr Tharman came by the three-storey Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre, where she has had a briyani stall since 2009, almost every week.\n\u201cHe took note of everything and cared for us... I\u2019m a single parent as well, so he always asked: \u2018What help do you need?\u2019\u201d said Madam Fatimah.\n\u201cIt feels empty now that he doesn\u2019t come by,\u201d she lamented.\nIt was a sentiment mirrored by Ms Ryn Hashim, 38, who owns Malay food stall Sinar Rezeki. She has run the stall for 13 years.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can replace him,\u201d she said.\nOn May 4, Mr Ng made another appearance in Serangoon North Avenue 3 at a FairPrice Group May Day block party that was also attended by PAP MP Ng Ling Ling.\nMs Ng is the representative for Jalan Kayu, which comes under Ang Mo Kio GRC.\nAt the event, Ms Ng said the labour chief had described residents in the area as \u201cvery warm\u201d and welcoming."}
