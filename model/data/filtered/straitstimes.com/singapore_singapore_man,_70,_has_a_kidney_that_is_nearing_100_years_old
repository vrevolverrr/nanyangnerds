Then I gradually lost the strength to kick the ball. After the game, I had to lie down on the field for an hour before I could get up to go home,\u201d he said.\nMr Kong said he became very lethargic and got exhausted easily \u2013 climbing the steps to an overhead bridge took him 15 minutes.\n\u201cI even had to sit up while sleeping, otherwise I would have difficulty breathing,\u201d he added.\nDr Sobhana Thangaraju, a senior consultant of renal medicine at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and SingHealth Duke-NUS Transplant Centre, said chronic glomerulonephritis develops silently over several years and can lead to severe damage, resulting in irreversible kidney failure.\nMr Kong\u2019s inability to breathe while lying down was due to fluid build-up in the lungs, she said.\nHis kidneys eventually failed in 1980 when he was 26.\nFor a period of five to six months, he underwent peritoneal dialysis, which removes waste and extra fluid through the blood vessels that line the walls of the abdomen.\n\u201cUntil the fourth day (of the dialysis), the pain became so excruciating that I needed morphine to relieve my suffering. I was also feeling so cold that the three blankets and hot-water bottle given to me did not help,\u201d he said.\nMr Kong underwent haemodialysis for the next three to four months. In this procedure, a machine removes blood from the patient\u2019s body, filters it through an artificial kidney and returns the clean blood to the body.\nHe said his doctor, Professor Woo Keng Thye, currently the emeritus consultant at SGH, then asked his siblings to come forward to undergo tests to see if they were suitable donors.\nMr Kong was fortunate that both his father and brother were found to be matches for donating a kidney to him. \u201cAlthough my brother was put on standby, it was my father who donated his kidney,\u201d he said.\nThat same year, a surgeon at SGH performed the transplant. The elder Mr Kong was then 54.\nIf no match had been found, Mr Kong would probably have needed to wait for eight to nine years before getting a kidney from a cadaveric or dead donor.\nHis father\u2019s selfless gift enabled Mr Kong to live a normal life. He married his girlfriend Vikki Tan, who had been with him since 1978 when they met at his first workplace. They have a son and a daughter.\nWhile Mr Kong has survived 44 years with his father\u2019s kidney, he is far from being the longest-surviving kidney transplant recipient. Ms Charlotte Markle, 81, for one, has lived longer, having had her transplant 58 years ago in 1966.\nDespite the changes to the Human Organ Transplant Act and technological advancement, there is still a long waiting list for an organ transplant. The longest wait is for cadaveric kidneys, with those who received a cadaveric kidney in 2023 having waited for around nine years on average.\nAs at end-2023, 400 patients were still on the waiting list for a cadaveric kidney transplant.\nData from the National Organ Transplant Unit at the Ministry of Health shows there were 39 kidney transplants from dead donors and 49 from living donors in 2023, compared with 33 and 56, respectively, in 2019.\nDr Sobhana said: \u201cWith the advancement in medical and surgical technology, surgery to remove the donor kidney can be done using laparoscopy (a form of keyhole surgery) and the donor is discharged from hospital three to four days after the operation.\u201d\nOnce a donor is discharged, he can resume normal activities and return to work within four to six weeks.\nDr Sobhana said most donors are able to lead long and healthy lives with one kidney, and their health outcomes are excellent. They also have regular follow-ups to ensure their kidneys are functioning normally.\nShe said that while a kidney from a dead donor lasts about 15 years and that from a living donor lasts for 20, Mr Kong\u2019s transplanted kidney, having lasted over 40 years, is \u201cone that occurs less often\u201d.\nMr Kong said his father continued to practise qigong after donating his kidney and was able to live a long and fruitful life until his death at the age of 83.\nMr Kong has also led a healthy life, returning to sports by taking part in the World Transplant Games. \u201cI was even the flag bearer in 1989,\u201d he said.\nApart from exercising to keep his father\u2019s kidney healthy, \u201cI drink red wine\u201d, Mr Kong said with a grin.\nHe is looking forward to visiting his daughter, who is working in Prague in the Czech Republic, in October.\n\u201cThat is when I will not only celebrate my 70th birthday, I will also be celebrating my 36th wedding anniversary with my wife, who has stood by me through everything,\u201d he added."}
