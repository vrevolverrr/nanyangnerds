Kyiv, which is currently the symbol and forward operating base of Europe\u2019s freedom and security, will not be given up by us.\"\nHe called on men who took wives and children to the relative safety of the west of the country earlier in the conflict to return to the capital to fight.\nSome have done so already, he and his brother Wladimir told Reuters in a recent interview.\nReuters witnesses saw a high-rise apartment block in flames after being struck by artillery. Firefighters tried to douse the blaze and rescue workers helped evacuate residents trapped inside using mobile ladders. A body lay on the ground in a bag.\nThe Artem weapons factory in central Kyiv was also hit, with footage taken by a local resident showing smoke coming from the roof.\nOutside kiosks nearby, shopkeepers and helpers swept up glass and other debris from the impact of the explosions.\nRussia said on Monday that it planned to attack Ukrainian arms factories in retaliation for what it said was a Ukrainian strike on the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, and urged workers and local residents to stay away.\nUkraine denied launching an attack.\nKyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24, but the Russian military is slowly closing in on the city and the shelling has intensified.\n\"What is happening right now in Kharkiv, in Mariupol and other cities \u2013 it was understandable that sooner or later it would happen in Kyiv,\" said local resident Igor Krupa.\nSitting on the ground outside the badly damaged apartment building, he described how he had cocooned himself with furniture and metal weights before going to sleep.\n\"This actually saved me because all the windows went out and all the debris went into the apartment, and I remained unwounded. Just a couple of scratches.\"\nIn another part of the city, residents cleared debris from their homes after shelling blew out windows, ruined balconies and left wreckage strewn across the ground.\nJust hours earlier President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 wearing his now-signature military-green T-shirt \u2013 issued a defiant video address claiming Russia was beginning to realise victory would not come on the battlefield.\n\u201cThey have already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war,\u201d Zelensky said, describing the latest round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators positively.\n\u201cPretty good, as I was told,\u201d he said of Monday\u2019s first day of discussions. \u201cBut let\u2019s see. They will continue tomorrow.\u201d\nThe two sides are far apart, with Moscow demanding Ukraine turn away from the West and recognise Moscow-backed breakaway regions.\nUkrainian negotiators say they want \u201cpeace, an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops\u201d.\nAlmost three weeks after vast columns of Russian forces marched across the border, Moscow\u2019s forces have bombarded and besieged several Ukrainian towns and cities.\nFighting has intensified in recent days around Kyiv, which is almost completely surrounded by Russian forces.\nMore than half of Kyiv's three million inhabitants have fled the city.\nOnly roads to the south of the capital remain open, and city authorities have set up checkpoints and residents are stockpiling food and medicine.\nThe United Nations estimates almost 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine and some 636 civilian deaths have been recorded, including dozens of children. The true toll is likely far higher.\nThousands of people have been killed in the conflict and millions more displaced.\nRussia, which denies targeting civilians, calls its actions a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to \u201cdenazify\u201d the country, a claim that Ukraine and its allies reject as a pretext for an unjustified and illegal attack.\n\u2018Hold back\u2019\nRussia\u2019s military progress has been slow and costly, with Moscow apparently underestimating the strength of Ukrainian resistance.\nMany military experts believe Russia\u2019s military now needs time to regroup and resupply its troops, paving the way for a possible pause or slowdown in fighting.\nThe head of Russia\u2019s national guard Viktor Zolotov has reportedly admitted the operation was \u201cnot going as fast as we would like\u201d but said victory would come step-by-step.\nMoscow has reportedly turned to Beijing for military and economic help \u2013 prompting what one US official said were several hours of \u201cvery candid\u201d talks between high-ranking US and Chinese officials.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his forces \u201cto hold back on any immediate assault on large cities\u201d according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who cited \u201ccivilian losses\u201d as the reason for stalling an attack.\nRussian troops have kept up their siege of southern Mariupol, where officials said nearly 2,200 people have been killed.\nIn a glimmer of hope for residents of the besieged port city, more than 160 civilian cars were able to leave along a humanitarian evacuation route on Monday after several failed attempts.\nUkraine plans to open nine \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d on Tuesday to evacuate civilians from areas besieged by Russian forces, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, adding that authorities will also try to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol.\nVitaliy Koval, the governor of the northern region of Rivne, said separately that the death toll from a Russian air strike on a television tower in his region on Monday had risen to at least 19.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s allies have piled pressure on Putin\u2019s regime with unprecedented economic sanctions, and the Kremlin faces domestic pressure despite widespread censorship of the war.\nDuring Russia\u2019s most-watched evening news broadcast on Monday, a dissenting employee entered the studio holding up a poster saying \u201cStop the war. Don\u2019t believe the propaganda.\u201d\nAn opposition protest monitor said the woman, an editor at the state broadcaster Channel One, was detained following the highly unusual breach of security.\nShelling in Kyiv\nAcross Ukraine, Russia\u2019s invasion has continued to take a bloody toll, destroying cities and ensuring that many lives will never be the same again.\n\u201cThey say that he is too severely burned, that I won\u2019t recognise him,\u201d sobbed Lidiya Tikhovska, 83, staring at the spot where a paramedic said the remains of her son Vitaliy lay following a missile strike in Kyiv.\n\u201cI wish Russia the same grief I feel now,\u201d she said, tears rolling down her cheeks as she clung to her grandson\u2019s elbow for support.\nA correspondent for Fox News \u2013 Britain\u2019s Benjamin Hall \u2013 was injured and hospitalised while reporting on the city outskirts, the network said, a day after a US journalist was shot dead in Irpin, a frontline Kyiv suburb.\nMeanwhile, Moscow-backed separatists said fragments from a shot-down Ukrainian Tochka-U missile ripped through the centre of the eastern city of Donetsk, killing 23 people.\nMoscow called it a \u201cwar crime\u201d and rebels published images of bloody corpses strewn in the street.\nBut Ukraine\u2019s army denied firing a missile at the city, with Ukrainian army spokesman Leonid Matyukhin saying in a statement: \u201cIt is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition.\u201d\nIn the neighbouring Luhansk region Ukrainian commander Sergiy Gaiday said the whole Ukrainian-held zone was being bombarded, including \u201chomes, hospitals, schools, water, gas and electricity networks\u201d as well as trains evacuating civilians.\nAt the other end of the country, in a village outside the western city of Rivne, local authorities said nine people died and another nine were injured when Russian forces hit a television tower."}
