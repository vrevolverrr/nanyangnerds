Some also suggest cuts in air pollution around the world could have accelerated global warming.\n\u201cThis cooling effect (of SO2) is well understood - and documented episodes have occurred as consequences of several major volcanic eruptions emitting SO2 during the past 2,000 years,\u201d said Stuart Haszeldine, director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute at the University of Edinburgh.\nHaszeldine, who was not involved in the paper, said while it was difficult to make exact predictions about the impact on global temperatures, the trend was \u201cvery clear, extremely worrying and very significant\u201d.\nOther scientists said the research might exaggerate the impact of the IMO fuel policy.\n\u201cResearch into why recent temperatures have been so high is ongoing and the reduced sulphur content in ship fuel is only one contributing factor,\u201d said Joel Hirschi at Britain\u2019s National Oceanography Centre.\nThe authors said their research showed that \u201cmarine cloud brightening\u201d could become a potential geoengineering solution to global warming.\nScientists have been looking into ways to reflect heat back into space, but proposals to inject SO2 into the atmosphere have been controversial. Other experiments have also been conducted to spray seawater into the air to thicken clouds. REUTERS"}
