Some even make reservations one to two months in advance,\u201d she said.\nUpon the launch of this service on July 6, the Shenzhen Evening News saw more than 800 inquiries. So far, hundreds of people have used it.\nAt the end of July, a metropolitan newspaper in north-west China\u2019s Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region also launched a tailored section for readers to publish their wedding announcements.\n\u201cAmid a digital transformation in media, the marriage announcement services have once again drawn public attention to print media, and offered new perspectives for future development,\u201d said Mr Ye Xiaobin, editor-in-chief of the Shenzhen Evening News.
