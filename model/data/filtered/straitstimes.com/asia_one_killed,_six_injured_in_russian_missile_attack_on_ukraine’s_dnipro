Three people were in severe condition.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky called on Ukraine\u2019s allies to step up supplies of air defences to help the military intercept Russia\u2019s regular aerial attacks.\nDnipro, which had a pre-war population of almost one million people, is a major Ukrainian city that lies on the road to the east of the country where the most intense fighting with Russian forces is raging.\nIt has been regularly targeted by missile and drone strikes since Russia launched its February 2022 invasion. Russia denies targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, but thousands of people have been killed. REUTERS"}
