He also said it can be highly effective in the hands of a good mediator, even among parties who are unwilling.\nMr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon GRC) asked if more could be done to make mediation settlements and orders more effective, noting that his residents have given feedback that they are often ignored.\nMr Tong said that to give mediation more standing and teeth, a mechanism will also be created for settlement agreements by the CMC to be registered and enforced as a CDRT order, provided certain conditions are met.\nThe ministry will study this matter and set out the conditions when the mechanism is rolled out, he added.\nSome MPs also asked for more to be done to make mediation more convenient and accessible, with Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok) suggesting that mediation be offered nearer to where people live, and Workers\u2019 Party MP Dennis Tan (Hougang) suggesting that the processes be simplified, such as the collection of evidence.\nAcknowledging that distance may deter some people from going for mediation, Mr Tong said the CMC has begun offering mediation services at six satellite locations at selected ServiceSG Centres and Community Clubs.\nOnline mediation is also being tried out at two group representation constituencies for suitable voluntary cases.\nAs for the more intractable cases, the CDRT will continue to be an avenue of last resort, and improvements will be made to address the difficulties that some people face in navigating the processes and procedures, Mr Tong added.\nHe said that stronger measures will be introduced to make sure people comply with CDRT orders. The ministry is also looking at how to better handle cases of nuisance involving underlying mental health conditions."}
