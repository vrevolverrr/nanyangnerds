Yet, the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) recent declaration that the current mpox outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern shows how hollow these promises have been.\nThe state of the outbreak highlights the complexity of the challenge, but it is an outcome that the global public health community has been warning about for years. Given that the first human case of mpox was identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo several decades ago, the current situation illustrates the need for a total overhaul of current systems and structures that have allowed this public health failure to unfold."}
