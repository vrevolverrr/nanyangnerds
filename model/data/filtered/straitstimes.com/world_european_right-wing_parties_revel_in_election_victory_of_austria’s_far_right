After the Czech Republic, another victory for the Patriots across the border... No war, no migration and no gender propaganda!\u201d\nDutch nationalist Geert Wilders, whose PVV party leads the Dutch government, responded to the FPO victory on X by saying: \u201cWe are winning! Times are changing! Identity, sovereignty, freedom and no more illegal immigration/asylum is what tens of millions of Europeans long for!\u201d\nItalian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini of the co-ruling League party said in a statement the Austrian vote was \u201ca historic day in the name of change\u201d.\n\u201cTo those who speak of the \u2018extreme right\u2019, let us remind them that in Vienna (as in almost all of Europe) there is only the desire for change by putting the values of work, family and security back at the centre,\u201d he added.
