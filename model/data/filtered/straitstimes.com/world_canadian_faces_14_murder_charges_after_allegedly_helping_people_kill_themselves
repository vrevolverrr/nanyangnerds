He also said he did not know how many people abroad might have died.\n\u201cWe continue to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and collaborate with them globally,\u201d said Insp James.\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corp, citing official records and statements, said Law could be linked to 117 deaths around the world, most of them in Britain. It said the authorities in New Zealand, France, Ireland, Italy, Germany and Switzerland all confirmed that Law shipped packages to their countries.\nLaw, who police allege used a number of websites to reach his victims, is in jail and will make his next court appearance on Dec 19.\n\u201cOne of the challenges that we face (is that) a number of these sites are located in other countries where Canadian law does not apply,\u201d said Insp James.\nIf Law is found guilty, he will go down as one of the worst mass murderers in Canadian history. In April 2020, a 51-year-old man shot dead 22 people in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia before being killed by police. REUTERS"}
