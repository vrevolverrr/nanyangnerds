But that model is no longer workable for the future that we are facing,\u201d High Commissioner of Malaysia to Singapore Azfar Mohamad Mustafa said at the forum.\nIskandar did not realise its full potential due to the strategies adopted for investment structuring and implementation, which adversely affected investment climate and investor confidence, according to industry feedback.\nDr Azfar said Singapore and Johor must now draw from each other\u2019s resources and skills and establish a single ecosystem with streamlined regulations and free movement of goods and people, as this will appeal to investors looking to invest or expand further in South-east Asia.\n\u201cThat is the whole idea of establishing the JSSEZ,\u201d he said.\nSupport and feedback from the private sector will be crucial to a deal on the JSSEZ, where Malaysia and Singapore officials are hoping to draw investments from sectors such as logistics and manufacturing amid geopolitical shifts away from China, as well as from data centres, healthcare and financial services.\n\u201cThe days when the government knows all are over. We can come up with good policies, but if they don\u2019t make sense to the private sector, then they will not be sustainable features for that project,\u201d Dr Azfar said.\nThe forum in Singapore took place a day after Malaysia\u2019s Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said at a similar forum in Kuala Lumpur that an agreement on the JSSEZ should be signed in September.\nIt was previously reported that the definitive full-fledged agreement between both countries is expected to be inked in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nSingapore\u2019s Ministry of Trade and Industry, which is negotiating with its Malaysian counterparts on the JSSEZ, has not provided a timeline on a deal.\nIn replies to parliamentary questions in May, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan noted that updates on the progress will be provided at a Singapore-Malaysia leaders\u2019 retreat later in the year.\nAt the forum, SBF shared the findings of a survey it conducted earlier in 2024 of 160 Singaporean businesses about the potential of an SEZ. This revealed that 93 per cent of respondents view Johor as an attractive investment destination, with 50 per cent already operating in the state.\nRecommendations from a JSSEZ working group comprising Singapore companies to address key pain points were also revealed at the forum. These include harmonising workforce regulations and streamlining tax and customs policies to ease the movement of goods.\nThere were also discussions with private-sector organisations, which included the Singapore Manufacturing Federation, United Overseas Bank and CapitaLand Development.\nAsked how the JSSEZ is different from previous initiatives, trade officials from Malaysia noted that engagement between the two governments as well as with the private sector has gained momentum in the six months since a memorandum of understanding to work on the JSSEZ was signed in January.\nThey added that there is strong buy-in from Malaysia\u2019s federal and state governments, and that the JSSEZ will not be starting from scratch, as it can leverage existing infrastructure at Iskandar to draw investors.\n\u201cCoupled with tax incentives, that will really attract businesses and investors to be based (in the SEZ),\u201d said Mr Vinothan Tulisinathzan, director of the Malaysian Investment Development Authority in Singapore."}
