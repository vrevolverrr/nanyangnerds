He walked slowly to the entrance, supported by aides.\nThe Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet. The Nobel Peace laureate has battled health problems for years.\nSome supporters arrived hours ahead of time to make sure they could catch a sight of a man making his first trip to the United States since 2017.\n\u201cI knew I had to come here for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And I think waiting outside for the past four or five hours is definitely worth it,\u201d said supporter Tenzin Kunkyi. \u201cThere is a strong sense of community when you\u2019re here, everyone\u2019s passing around bread... along with getting a blessing from seeing His Holiness, we also strengthen our Tibetan bond here outside.\u201d\nFollowers, many wearing traditional Tibetan outfits, danced in the streets outside the hotel.\n\u201cWe wish Dalai Lama long life. And we really wish Dalai Lama (would) visit China to say to the Tibetan community, \u2018Hi, hello\u2019,\u201d said supporter Byamba Suren, who left Virginia at 3am to drive to New York.\n\u201cOnce we saw him, it felt really powerful. And everyone was, like, emotional because he\u2019s, like, our leader,\u201d added 18-year-old, US-born Tenzin Pasang, who has now seen the Dalai Lama three times. \u201cSo it\u2019s very nice to see him in New York.\u201d\nShe welcomed the spiritual leader by joining in a performance of a traditional Tibetan dance.\nIt is unclear whether the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing sees as a dangerous separatist, will meet any US officials during his trip. He says he is not seeking independence for Tibet."}
