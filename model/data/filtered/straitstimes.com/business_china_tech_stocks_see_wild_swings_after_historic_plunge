The move follows the China tech gauge\u2019s biggest drop since its July 2020 inception on Monday.\nThe sudden bounce mid-morning came as China\u2019s economic data beat estimates, lifting sentiment and suggesting resilience before the country\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak forced lockdowns in major cities. Broader benchmarks such as the Hang Seng Index and CSI 300 also pared losses after the data dump.\n\u201cMarket is oversold and investors are looking for bargain hunting in the context of expected fiscal stimulus and monetary easing as Covid cases are rising,\u201d said Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX.\nSentiment toward Chinese tech had morphed into fear in recent days as new regulatory developments including possible US delisting and Beijing\u2019s ties with Russia alarmed investors.\nThe rout has pushed the valuation of MSCI China Index versus its global peers to a record low. JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts have even labeled some Chinese internet names as \u201cuninvestable\u201d.\nEarlier in the morning, the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s kept interest rates on its one-year policy loans steady, even as a majority of surveyed economists expected a cut. The central bank also injected a net 100 billion yuan (S$21.4 billion) into the financial system.\n\u201cMarkets were initially disappointed by the MLF rate hold, but more positive after economic data beat expectations across the board southbound stock connect has been relatively strong, indicating bargain hunting,\u201d said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe data on Tuesday showed China\u2019s economy started the first two months of the year on a strong footing, although risks are growing as the number of local coronavirus cases surge and global energy prices spike due to Russia-Ukraine tensions.\nIndustrial output grew 7.5 per cent in the two months through February, compared with 4.3 per cent in December. Economists had expected 4 per cent expansion.\nRetail sales rose 6.7 per cent, accelerating from 1.7 per cent in December and beating a 3 per cent increase projected by economists. Investment climbed 12.2 per cent during the two-month period, better than the 5 per cent estimate and last year\u2019s 4.9 per cent growth. The surveyed jobless rate rose to 5.5 per cent last month, mainly due to seasonal factors.\n\u201cOverall the economy had good recovery momentum in January and February,\u201d NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said in a statement. However, the \u201cexternal environment still remains complex and grim, and there are many risks and challenges faced by China\u2019s economy,\u201d it added.\nData in the first two months are usually distorted by the Lunar New Year holidays and also complicated by the high base of comparison from last year.\nChina\u2019s state-run papers have been trying to talk up sentiment, a tactic that\u2019s so far proved insufficient in stemming the market sell-off. The Chinese stock market will remain on a positive trend over the long term despite low investor confidence resulting from the conflict in Ukraine and the latest Covid-19 outbreak, China Securities Journal said in a commentary."}
