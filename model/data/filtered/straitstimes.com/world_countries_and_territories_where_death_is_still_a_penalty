The countries include Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Israel and Peru.\nSo far, there have been 108 nations that do not allow the use of death penalty by law.\nIn terms of state-sanctioned executions, there were 579 in 2021, according to Amnesty International. That same year, at least 2,000 death sentences were served.\nIran was the biggest executioner, with 314 people executed, followed by Egypt (83), Saudi Arabia (65), Syria (24), Somalia (21) and the US (11). No records were available for China, where data on the death penalty is classified as a state secret.\nIn Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest mass execution in years, 81 men were executed in one day in March.\nMost of these countries use hanging or shooting as their execution methods. China, the US and Vietnam prefer lethal injection, while Saudi Arabia continues to use beheading with a sword."}
