Countries were unable to advance on an issue that has eroded trust at climate talks for years.\nIn a letter to the roughly 200 nations that have signed up to the UN\u2019s Paris Agreement \u2013 the world\u2019s main climate pact \u2013 COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev lamented the absence of \u201cnecessary progress\u201d.\n\u201cWe clearly need a rapid increase in the pace of our work,\u201d wrote Mr Babayev, a government minister and former executive at Azerbaijan\u2019s national oil company.\n\u201cTime lost is lives, livelihoods and the planet lost,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe call on all parties to increase the pace of their work and move on from their early negotiating positions.\u201d\n\u2018Supercharge\u2019 efforts\nMr Babayev\u2019s appeal comes in the hottest year on record and as extreme heatwaves, floods and wildfires batter communities around the globe.\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, whose own homeland of Grenada was devastated by hurricane Beryl earlier in July, urged countries to put the fight against global warming back on the political agenda.\n\u201cRather than just counting the costs of climate carnage, all governments must supercharge efforts to prevent them,\u201d said Mr Stiell.\nHe was speaking during a visit to the island of Carriacou, where his grandmother\u2019s house was among many destroyed.\n\u201cStanding here, it\u2019s impossible not to recognise the vital importance of delivering climate finance,\u201d he added.\nWealthy nations have been under pressure to commit to new financing targets that go well beyond the US$100 billion (S$134 billion) a year they promised in 2009.\nDeveloping nations excluding China will need about US$2.4 trillion a year in climate investment by 2030, according to an expert assessment commissioned by the UN.\nThat is nearly 25 times more than the present levels.\nBut nations are nowhere near agreeing on a dollar aid figure, with talks bogged down over who should pay, what form the money should take and who should receive it.\nInformal talks\nUnder a 1992 climate accord, only a handful of the wealthiest industrialised nations at the time were obligated to pay climate finance.\nSome want the pool of contributors widened, most notably to include China, which is today vastly wealthier than 30 years ago, and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\nBut this has been a non-starter for developing nations, who have accused wealthy countries of trying to shirk their responsibility.\nTo break the ice, Azerbaijan will host the negotiating teams for an informal two-day retreat starting July 26.\nThey have named two experienced diplomats \u2013 Dan Jorgensen of Denmark and Yasmine Fouad of Egypt \u2013 to help the parties make headway.\nMr Babayev said the impasse would \u201cnot be solved by negotiators alone\u201d, calling for political leadership on the sidelines to help move discussions toward consensus.
