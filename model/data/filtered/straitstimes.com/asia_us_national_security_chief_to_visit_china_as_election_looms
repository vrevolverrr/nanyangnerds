This will be the first visit to China by a US national security adviser since one by Ms Susan Rice under former president Barack Obama before the 2016 US election.\nMr Sullivan\u2019s trip comes ahead of the Nov 5 US presidential election that pits current Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris against former Republican president Donald Trump, in which US competition with China is a key foreign policy issue.\nThe US and China have sought to stabilise rocky ties in the past year since they sank to a historic low point after the US downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon in 2023.\nUS news website Axios reported earlier that Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang are expected to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting with US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later in 2024, to follow up on their California summit in November 2023.\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said he had no specific information on this but called US-China \u201cthe most important bilateral relationship in the world right now\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep trying to manage this relationship in a way that\u2019s consistent with our national security priorities,\u201d he told a regular briefing.\nShortly after the trip announcement, Washington said it was imposing sanctions on more than 400 entities and individuals for supporting Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine, including Chinese companies US officials believe are helping Moscow to skirt Western sanctions and build up its military.\nTough points\nThe senior administration official said Mr Sullivan\u2019s visit should not be associated too closely with the election.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. We\u2019ve tried to do these Wang Yi-Jake Sullivan touchpoints about once a quarter,\u201d the official said.\n\u201c(The election) is always in the background in any engagement we have with foreign officials concerned about what comes next or what the transition will be like, but this meeting will be focused on the topics and the issues that we are dealing with,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can get done before the end of the year in terms of just managing the relationship. I think that will be the focus.\u201d\nThe official added that Mr Sullivan would push for a resumption of theatre-level military-to-military talks with China, and was also likely to raise US concerns about China\u2019s \u201cincreased military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taiwan\u201d.\nHe would also be looking to hear China\u2019s assessment of the situation in the Middle East, where the two sides have different approaches but some shared concerns about instability.\n\u201cIt really is about clearing up misperceptions and avoiding this competition from veering into conflict more than anything else,\u201d the official said.\n\u201cThe fight against illicit precursor chemicals and fentanyl is... a constantly evolving trade, and so there are always things we need to push forward.\u201d\nCritics in Washington argue that the Biden administration has not put enough pressure on Beijing over fentanyl-related substances, which are the leading cause of US drug of overdoses.\nChina says it is cracking down on fentanyl and precursor chemicals and that the US crisis is a problem of demand, not supply.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Mr Wang and Mr Xi in Beijing in April. That visit brought little progress on contentious issues, although there was some effort to ease the mood by emphasising educational and other cultural exchanges.\nMr Blinken reiterated Washington\u2019s concerns over Beijing\u2019s actions towards Taiwan and its support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine when he met Mr Wang in Laos in July.
