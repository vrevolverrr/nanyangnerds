He said he had done so to look for evidence of Dr Chen\u2019s non-compliance with the HODs\u2019 instruction to stop attending the ENT clinic and to check if Dr Chen had stopped misbehaving.\nThe COI recommended that Dr Tan be issued a warning.\nGiven that the case involved data breach, it was escalated to the SingHealth disciplinary council, which is chaired by the group CEO, with the deputy group CEOs as its members.\nThe council decided to dismiss Dr Tan. Ms Kuah said the council members will testify on the reasons why each of them decided to do so.\n\u201cIt was SingHealth\u2019s prerogative as an employer to reject his self-proclaimed justifications for his misconduct, and well within SingHealth\u2019s contractual right to terminate his employment,\u201d she said."}
