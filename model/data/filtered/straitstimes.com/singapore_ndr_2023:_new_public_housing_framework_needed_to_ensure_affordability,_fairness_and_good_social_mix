{"title": "NDR 2023: New public housing framework needed to ensure affordability, fairness and good social mix", "tags": "singapore", "timestamp": "2023-08-20", "content": "SINGAPORE - A new classification framework for public housing is needed to ensure homes here remain affordable, with a good social mix in towns, and the system is fair for all, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday.\nThis is because the distinction between mature and non-mature estates, under the current classification framework, is blurring as non-mature estates are increasingly more developed.\nIn his National Day Rally speech, PM Lee said the Government will gradually provide more housing grants \u2013 especially grants that are means-tested \u2013 to keep costs down while providing the most support to lower- and middle-income households.\nHowever, as the housing landscape here evolves, there is still the issue of how to value housing projects in \u201cchoicer\u201d locations, which has posed a dilemma for the authorities, he said.\nTo resolve this, there will be a new Plus category for Build-To-Order (BTO) projects in locations deemed to be attractive, such as those close to MRT stations and town centres, PM Lee announced.\nThis new category will have more subsidies and stricter sale conditions, such as a 10-year minimum occupation period and an income ceiling on resale buyers. The idea is to enable the Housing Board (HDB) to moderate the prices of these flats and put them within reach of more people.\nBlurring of lines between mature and non-mature estates\nPM Lee noted that HDB has, since the 1990s, used the simple framework of mature and non-mature estates to guide public housing purchases here.\nMature estates are usually more centrally located, better connected and have more amenities, like Toa Payoh, and their popularity among homebuyers is reflected in the prices of the flats there.\nNon-mature estates lose out in terms of location and convenience, but they make up for it in lower BTO prices.\nThe issue now is that the distinction between these two categories is blurring, with the non-mature estates of today becoming much more developed than in the past, PM Lee said.\n\u201cWe imagine non-mature estates as being very bare-bones. Blocks of flats surrounded by empty, barren ground... But look around you now. Towns like Jurong East, Woodlands or Punggol... These towns have matured, and now have excellent connectivity and a full suite of amenities,\u201d he added.\nNoting that some BTO projects in non-mature estates are even more popular than those in mature estates, PM Lee said this shows that what matters to homebuyers are the specific attributes of a housing project, not whether the estate it is in has been called mature or non-mature.\nIn addition, he said there are fewer tracts of undeveloped land available to build new towns and estates.\nTengah, which was the first HDB town to be developed since Punggol more than two decades ago, will be the last new town here for some time \u2013 at least until Paya Lebar Air Base moves out to Changi and the site is cleared and redeveloped.\nSingapore will increasingly need to build new HDB flats within or near existing estates, and these will often be more centrally located. PM Lee cited previously announced plans to build 5,000 new homes on the Old Police Academy site in the Mount Pleasant area as an example.\nHe added that many more BTO developments in the future will be in estates and locations that are effectively considered \u201cmature\u201d.\n\u201cThat means the framework of mature and non-mature estates will no longer work,\u201d he said.\nTackling affordability and the \u2018lottery effect\u2019\nIn announcing the new classification framework for HDB flats here, PM Lee said new BTO projects nestled in older, more developed areas will be more popular and naturally cost more.\nThis is also the case for projects in choicer locations within a region, such as those near an MRT station or town centre.\nSuch flats see the highest demand during BTO exercises because people know that it is a good deal, and the properties will fetch much higher resale prices later on, PM Lee added.\nHowever, he warned that this turns the BTO exercise into a lottery as those who are lucky enough to ballot such flats stand to gain a windfall, which is not fair to the many more who miss out.\nHe added that the dilemma with projects like this is that if HDB prices them higher, it would shrink potential windfall gains, reduce the lottery effect and moderate demand \u2013 but also make these flats so expensive that they would be unaffordable for most families. The precinct runs the risk of becoming a higher-income enclave.\nOn the other hand, if HDB prices such projects lower to make them more affordable and get a better social mix, this would exacerbate the lottery effect and even more families would try for these flats.\n\u201cFor every one happy successful buyer, there will be maybe 20, maybe more unsuccessful buyers, and they will be understandably and justifiably frustrated and very unhappy. And this is not fair,\u201d PM Lee said.\nHe gave the example of Central Weave @ AMK \u2014 a BTO project in Ang Mo Kio that made the headlines when it was launched in August 2022, as prices for the five-room and three-generation flats in the project ranged from $713,000 to $877,000 before grants.\nThese are the most expensive BTO flats HDB has ever launched.\nExplaining why the prices for the project were so high, even after the flats were heavily discounted off their true market value, PM Lee said the Central Weave @ AMK is highly desirable due to its location next to the MRT station and bus interchange, as well as its proximity to a hawker centre, wet market and AMK Hub.\nGood outcomes for PLH model\nTo illustrate how the new BTO classification will work, he said if Central Weave @ AMK were sold as a Plus project, HDB would have been able to lower the selling price of the units by providing more subsidies, but also maintain fairness by imposing tighter sales conditions.\nHe noted that a similar combination of increased subsidies and tighter restrictions is already being used for the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model announced in 2021, which has shown good outcomes so far.\nFor example, four-room flats in the Bukit Merah Ridge BTO project, which is being sold under the PLH scheme, launched in May 2022 with prices ranging between $540,000 to $737,000.\nPM Lee said each of these flats attracted 5.4 applicants, far fewer than Central Weave @ AMK, even when compared with the four-room flats in the Ang Mo Kio project.\n\u201cWe hope Plus projects will achieve similarly good outcomes,\u201d he added.\n\u201cAs we build more projects in mature areas, this Plus model will help us to meet our three objectives: affordability, good social mix, and fairness.\u201d"}
