Neither has it signalled when the country will reopen its borders. It is also unclear if local health authorities will implement this measure, especially if zero-Covid-19 continues to be its priority.\nThere have, however, been some easing of health protocols.\nA number of cities including Beijing have since April begun to pilot a reduced quarantine duration of 10 days, as health authorities acknowledge that the Omicron variant has a shorter incubation period.\nPre-departure testing for those travelling to China has also been relaxed in a few countries in recent weeks, while those applying for work or family visas from certain countries no longer require a government-issued letter of invitation. Both these changes benefit travellers from Singapore.\nBut getting a plane ticket remains a major challenge for travellers, as China still suspends airlines on inbound routes for bringing in infected passengers.\nBesides cutting quarantine time for international travellers, health authorities on Tuesday also eased their risk classification criteria, which would make it easier for people to travel within the country.\nClose contacts of those infected will also be allowed to now spend seven days isolating at home instead of at a centralised facility.\nBeijing and Shanghai had both reported no new cases on Monday for the first time since late February, after both cities battled their worst outbreaks since the beginning of the pandemic with lockdowns, school and business closures and city-wide testing."}
