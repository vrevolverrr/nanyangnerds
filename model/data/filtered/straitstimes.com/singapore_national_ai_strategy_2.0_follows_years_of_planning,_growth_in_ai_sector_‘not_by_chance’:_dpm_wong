These included the use of AI in border clearance operations, for predicting chronic diseases, and for moving freight more efficiently. They continue to be incrementally rolled out under plans in the inaugural edition of the country\u2019s AI strategy.\nMore than $500 million has been invested in research and development through national research programme AI Singapore since 2019.\nAI could also be used for administration to help residents through an AI-powered chatbot, and to roll out pre-emptive estate maintenance.\nUnder the earlier plan, students receive a more personalised learning experience, while teachers enjoy the benefits of an automated marking system, allowing them to focus less on routine assessment tasks.\nSingapore has made headway in many of the goals listed in the 2019 AI strategy report, said DPM Wong, adding: \u201cIt is not by chance that we can do these in Singapore today.\u201d\nHospitals have ramped up their use of AI, which now helps medical professionals to screen for illnesses like heart disease, malaria and near-invisible cancerous growths with greater accuracy.\nAI is also playing a growing role in the classroom. The AI-enabled Adaptive Learning System makes customised learning recommendations for each pupil based on how he or she responds to questions and activities.\nThe system was launched in June for mathematics in three topics covered at Primary 5.\nAt the borders, a next-generation gantry is in the works to allow travellers to clear immigration by simply walking through, instead of having to wait behind multiple barriers to scan their passports and biometrics.\nProgress in AI has helped Singapore to carve itself a niche, achieving high rankings in global AI indices and laying the ground for more than 80 active AI research faculties, and 1,100 AI-related start-ups here, said the report.\nIn 2023, the nation rallied 50 tech firms and AI-builders, including the likes of Google and Microsoft, to form the AI Verify Foundation, which will set guidelines on how AI should be built to mitigate risks like biased databases and false information.\nThese issues have spilt into the mainstream due to the rapid development of generative AI, spearheaded by the public roll-out of ChatGPT and similar large language models that provide human-like AI assistance.\nIn the light of these advancements, Singapore\u2019s strategy must expand for businesses and society to reap the rewards and mitigate AI\u2019s threats, the report noted.\nLeading AI experts from around the world are here for the three-day Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI), where they will discuss the most pressing issues that AI poses to the world. Their findings will be made public on Dec 6.\nOpening the conference on Dec 4 at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, Communications and Information Minister Josephine Teo said: \u201cSpecifically, our goal in the next few days together is to identify the critical questions of AI that, if answered systematically, will enable AI to truly serve the global good. Asking the right questions gets us closer to the answers we need.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cSCAI is an experiment and we will be collectively learning along the way. But we know that we must try, because the age of AI is too important for us to sleepwalk into.\u201d"}
