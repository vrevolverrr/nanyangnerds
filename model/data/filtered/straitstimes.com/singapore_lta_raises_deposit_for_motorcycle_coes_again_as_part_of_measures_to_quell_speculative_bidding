Otherwise, they will be returned to the pool for bidding and the deposit forfeited.\nThe LTA also revealed the total COE quota for the next three-month period from May to July across vehicle types, with fewer available for cars.\nFor cars with engines up to 1,600cc and 130bhp, as well as for electric vehicles (EVs) with up to 110 kilowatts of power, there will be a monthly average of 932 COEs \u2013 7.72 per cent fewer than the monthly average of 1,010 for the period of February to April.\nThe supply of COEs for larger and more powerful cars and EVs will be 8.26 per cent lower, with a monthly average of 789, down from 860 previously. Open category COEs fall from 259 a month on average, to 248, marking a cut of 4.25 per cent.\nAlthough Open category COEs can be used to register any type of vehicles other than motorcycles, they are almost exclusively used on larger cars. Put together, the figures mean that the supply of COEs for more powerful cars will be effectively 7.33 per cent lower for the May to July period compared with the previous three months.\nCOE premiums for cars have been setting new highs. At the most recent tender exercise that closed on Wednesday, the price of the Open category COE closed at $124,501, which was the highest figure ever recorded for any type of COE.\nCOE supply is determined mainly by the average number of vehicles taken off the road in the previous four quarters of the year.\nFewer cars were deregistered in the past three months, reducing the quota for the respective categories in the upcoming May to July period.\nThere will be 59.3 per cent more commercial vehicle COEs, up from a monthly average of 86 from February to April to 137 from May to July.\nFor motorcycle COEs, the monthly average will be 1,085 \u2013 16.8 per cent higher than the 929 in the February to April period.\nLTA\u2019s latest measures on motorcycle COEs come after the bid deposit was raised from $200 to $800, and the validity period cut from six months to three in March 2022. The tweaks were announced after the COE premium hit $10,000 in January 2022. That was the first time the price of motorcycle COEs hit the five-digit mark.\nBesides the tight supply of motorcycle COEs, industry watchers believe speculative bidding has led to rising premiums. Dealers could afford to secure COEs at high prices during tenders and let them lapse as the penalty for not utilising them was $800 each.\nBetween January and March, 457 motorcycle COEs were allowed to lapse \u2013 nearly half of January\u2019s supply of 880."}
