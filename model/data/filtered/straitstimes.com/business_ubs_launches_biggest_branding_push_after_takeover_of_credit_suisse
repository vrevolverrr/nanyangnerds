Together we can find an answer\u201d in previous campaigns.\nThe new campaign was developed together with advertising firm Publicis Zurich and brand strategy company Prophet.\n\u201cThis campaign portrays UBS as a strengthened, global firm, and helps reshape how our clients, prospects and investors perceive us,\u201d Mr Ermotti said.\nThe bank, which oversees more than US$5 trillion (S$6.7 trillion) in assets and is currently integrating Credit Suisse, has already agreed to continue the fallen bank\u2019s longstanding sponsorship of the Swiss national football team and tennis legend Roger Federer.\nThe global campaign will go live first in Britain and the United States from Tuesday before being rolled out to 10 other countries, including Singapore, Australia, Germany and Japan.\nThe concept of \u201ccraft\u201d evokes the best attributes of Swissness, Mr McDonald said, and would help raise awareness of UBS particularly in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\u201cCraft signals personal attention, care, expertise, precision, passion,\u201d Mr McDonald said. \u201c...in a sense of a carefully curated expertise that\u2019s deployed for an individual customer.\u201d REUTERS"}
