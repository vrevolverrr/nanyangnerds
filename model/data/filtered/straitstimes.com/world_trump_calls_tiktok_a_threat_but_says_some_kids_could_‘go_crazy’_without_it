And I think Facebook has been very dishonest.\u201d\nHe confirmed on CNBC that he met recently with investor Jeff Yass, whose investment firm Susquehanna International Group has a stake in ByteDance. Trump said they did not talk about TikTok.\nMeta Platforms shares closed down 4.4 per cent at US$483.59 (S$643) on March 11. The company declined to comment.\nTrump previously criticised the company for revoking his access to Facebook and Instagram after removing two of his posts during the Jan 6, 2021, US Capitol riot. His accounts were reinstated in February 2023.\nTrump also said a TikTok ban could impact young people.\n\u201cThere are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good and there\u2019s a lot of bad with TikTok.\u201d\nTikTok CEO Chew Shou Zi will visit Capitol Hill later this week on a previously scheduled trip to talk to senators, a source briefed on the matter said.\nPresident Joe Biden said last week that he would sign the Bill after a committee unanimously approved the measure.\nTikTok, which says it has not and would not share US user data with the Chinese government, argues that the Bill amounts to a ban. It is unclear if China would approve any sale or if TikTok could be divested in six months.\n\u201cThis legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,\u201d the company said on March 8. \u201cThe government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.\u201d\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise said \u201cwe must ensure the Chinese government cannot weaponise TikTok against American users and our government through data collection and propaganda.\u201d\nThe Bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok. If it fails to do so, app stores operated by Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and others cannot legally offer TikTok or provide Web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.\nIn 2020, Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.\nGetting the legislation approved by both the House and Senate in an election year may be difficult. In February, Mr Biden\u2019s re-election campaign joined TikTok.\nTrump\u2019s campaign has not joined the app. REUTERS"}
