There is much at stake for both countries, and it\u2019s in their mutual interest to find a way forward.\u201d\nThe US Justice Department said an unnamed Indian government employee directed a plot targeting the Sikh activist, who was also unnamed but is understood to be Mr Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a lawyer for the New York-based Sikhs for Justice. The group seeks a separate Sikh state called Khalistan out of India\u2019s Punjab state.\nMr Pannun is a wanted man in India, which considers Sikhs for Justice a group that supports terrorism.\nThe Indian government employee allegedly recruited an Indian national named Nikhil Gupta to hire a local hitman to carry out the assassination. But the hitman, who was offered US$100,000 (S$133,000) for the job, was actually a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Agency.\nThe plot was foiled in June. Nikhil Gupta, arrested in the Czech Republic in late June, has been charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. The US is seeking his extradition.\nWashington raised the plot with India\u2019s government then, and New Delhi has set up a committee to investigate it. On Nov 30, Mr Arindam Bagchi, spokesman for India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs, said at a press conference: \u201cLet me reiterate, this is\u2026 contrary to government policy.\u201d\nThe episode came on the heels of the Canadian government accusing India of orchestrating the killing of a Khalistan activist and Canadian citizen, Mr Hardeep Singh Nijjar, also in June, in British Columbia.\nThe Canadian government has yet to produce any evidence in public, and the allegation was sharply rejected by New Delhi, which has long accused Canada of harbouring those it deems to be terrorists.\nThere is more at stake in the US case, however.\nFor President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, a strong relationship with India is critical to its Indo-Pacific strategy \u2013 including the four-nation Quad, said Dr Aparna Pande, director of the Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington.\nThe Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, comprises India, Australia, Japan and the US. India is due to host a summit of the Quad in 2024.\n\u201cFor the US, the primary threat remains China, and a strong India-US partnership is a key element of US national security strategy,\u201d Dr Pande said.\n\u201cFor India too, the relationship with the US is one of its most important; India\u2019s ambitions\u2026 are tied to a strong relationship with the US in the economic, defence and technological realms,\u201d she told The Straits Times.\nBut she cautioned that an attempt on an American citizen is something that any US administration has to take seriously, saying: \u201cSome reputational damage has already occurred.\u201d\n\u201cThis will continue because of constant media references, social media tweets and broader discussion among the American public,\u201d Dr Pande added.\n\u201cIndia will thus need to find a way to sit down and talk with the US on this issue so that both sides can then move on and not allow this to linger for too long.\u201d\nIn New Delhi, Mr Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank, warned of a trust deficit, saying: \u201cSecurity ties, which also include intelligence sharing, require a high level of trust. A trust deficit of sorts will arise.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWhile the shared concern over the growing assertiveness of China would remain a driver in US-India ties, the onus was on India to clarify its role, if any, in the thwarted plot.\u201d\nOtherwise, he said, \u201cthe situation will hang over the relationship, at least for a while\u201d.\nMr Richard Rossow, chair in US-India Policy Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank, noted that the New York plot was uncovered well before major high-level India-US engagements, which still went ahead.\nThese included Mr Biden\u2019s visit to New Delhi in September for the Group of 20 summit.\nThus, the issue is \u201cthorny, but not enough to trigger a course change\u201d, he said.\nAdditional reporting by Nirmala Ganapathy in New Delhi"}
