I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner,\u201d Blinken told reporters.\nPresident Joe Biden has faced growing public pressure to find a way home for Griner, a basketball star jailed for transport of cannabis oil, and Whelan, a former Marine jailed on espionage charges he denies.\nBlinken declined to characterise Lavrov\u2019s reaction, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t give you an assessment of whether I think things are any more or less likely.\u201d \u201cBut it was important that he heard directly from me on that,\u201d Blinken said.\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry, in a statement on the call, said that relations between the two nations \u201care in strong need of normalization.\u201d\n\u201cAs for a potential swap of Russian and American prisoners, the Russian side insisted that we return to a regime of professional dialogue, free of media speculation, in the framework of discreet diplomacy,\u201d it said.\nLavrov also denounced the US military and Nato for their supply of billions of dollars of weapons to Ukraine, saying it \u201conly prolonged the agony of the Kyiv regime, extending the conflict and its victims.\u201d the foreign ministry said.\nWarnings on annexation\nThe US proposal, sent quietly to Russia several weeks earlier, reportedly includes swapping the two Americans for convicted Russian arms smuggler Viktor Bout and would follow a similar prisoner exchange in April.\nBlinken said he also pressed Lavrov on Russia honouring a Turkish-brokered proposal to ship grain out of Ukraine and on purported plans by Moscow to annex additional parts of Ukraine seized by Russian troops.\nBlinken said he told Lavrov that the world will not recognize annexation.\n\u201cIt was very important that the Russians hear directly from us that that will not be accepted \u2013 and not only will it not be accepted, it will result in additional significant costs being imposed upon Russia if it follows through,\u201d Blinken said.\nBlinken said Russia was preparing \u201csham referendums\u201d to try to \u201cfalsely demonstrate that the people in these parts of Ukraine somehow seek to become part of Russia.\u201d The votes would be part of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s objective of \u201cgobbling up as much Ukrainian territory as he can,\u201d he added.\nThe telephone conversation was the first between Blinken and Lavrov since Feb 15, when the top US diplomat warned Russia against invading Ukraine, repeating a message he delivered in person in Geneva a month earlier.\nPutin went ahead and attacked nine days later, leading the United States and its allies to impose sweeping sanctions and to seek to isolate Russia on the world stage.\nBlinken refused to meet Lavrov when they both attended talks in early July in Bali of the Group of 20 major economies. They are likely to cross paths again next week at talks of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Cambodia."}
