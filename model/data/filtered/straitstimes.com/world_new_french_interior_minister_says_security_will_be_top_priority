Only one left-wing politician joined the Cabinet, Mr Didier Migaud as justice minister.\nHow stable the new government will be, and whether it will manage to get reforms adopted by parliament, remains to be seen, with the adoption of the 2025 budget a first, tough challenge.\nThe centrist and conservative parties managed to join forces, but will depend on others, and in particular Ms Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right RN, to stay in power and get Bills adopted by a very fractured parliament.\nThe RN gave tacit support to Mr Barnier\u2019s premiership but reserved the right to back out at any point if its concerns over immigration, security and other issues were not met.
