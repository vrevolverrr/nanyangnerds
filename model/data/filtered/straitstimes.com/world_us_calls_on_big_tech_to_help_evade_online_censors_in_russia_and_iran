The US injected increased funding into VPNs supported by the OTF following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Reuters exclusively reported at the time.\nThe organisation has since received a boost to its budget from the US State Department via its Surge and Sustain Fund for Anti-Censorship Technology, an initiative created at the Biden administration\u2019s Summit for Democracy.\nBut it has struggled to meet increased demand in countries like Russia, Myanmar, and Iran, where internet censorship heavily restricts access to outside information.\nAround 46 million people a month now use US-backed VPNs, Ms Cunningham said, but added that a sizeable chunk of the budget was taken up by the cost of hosting all that network traffic on private sector servers.\n\u201cWe want to support these additional users, but we don\u2019t have the resources to keep up with this surging demand,\u201d she said.\nRepresentatives of Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.\nA Cloudflare spokesperson said the firm was working with researchers to \u201cbetter document internet shutdowns and censorship\u201d.
