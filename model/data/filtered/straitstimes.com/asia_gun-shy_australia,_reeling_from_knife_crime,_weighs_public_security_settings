He said the state would review whether security guards could carry handcuffs, pepper spray or batons although he ruled out guns or tasers.\nRoland Springis, a security guard who has worked in malls, has collected more than 3,000 signatures in three days for a Change.org petition calling for more protective equipment.\n\"We don't have anything,\" said Springis.\nQueensland state Premier Steven Miles said the stabbing at the Bondi mall added weight to the argument to extend warrantless stop-and-searches by police, local media reported.\nQueensland legislation known as Jack's Law, passed last month, allows police to use hand-held metal detectors, known as wands, to search people in all safe night precincts, at public transport stations and on public transport without a warrant. The strategy is to detect weapons and combat knife crime.\n\"We've been actively considering whether to expand the public spaces that police can wand in to include shopping centres,\" Miles said.\nAs part of the Bondi Junction mall reopening on April 19, all 37 Westfield shopping centres nationally will have an increased security presence, local media reported, citing the company.\nTough gun laws\nPolitical leaders and policy experts pointed to the stabbings as reminders about how much worse a public attack could be if it was easier for the perpetrator to get a gun.\nAustralia introduced tough new gun laws in 1996 after the \"Port Arthur Massacre\", the country's deadliest mass shooting, when a lone man with no police record used military-style weapons to shoot dead 35 people in and around a cafe at a historic former prison in Tasmania.\nAustralia banned all semi-automatic rifles and all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns. Thousands of unlicensed firearms were surrendered under a gun amnesty programme, and licensed gun owners are now required to take a safety course.\nSince then, total gun homicides in the country have halved while the overall number of homicides has flatlined, according to Australian Institute of Criminology data, even as the population has increased 50 per cent.\nAustralia now has less than one-third the number of annual homicides per capita in the United States.\nBut the proportion of homicides caused by a knife or other sharp implement has risen to 43 per cent in the five years to 2021, the latest year data is available, from 34 pre cent in the five years before the 1996 laws, according to institute data shared with Reuters.\nOn April 13, during busy afternoon shopping at Westfield Bondi Junction, a mentally ill 40-year-old man with a knife killed six people before being shot dead by police.\nOn April 15, a teenage boy stormed an Assyrian Christian church service in the city's outer suburbs and was arrested for stabbing a priest mid-sermon and several bystanders. All victims survived the attack which the authorities said was terrorism motivated by suspected religious extremism.\n\"If the crimes committed over the past days had been committed with easily accessible high powered firearms, there is no doubt the number of victims would be far greater,\" said Justin Wong, principal lawyer at Streeton Lawyers, a criminal lawfirm.
