It will be operational from July 9.\nAdvanced robotics therapy enhances physical rehabilitation for patients recovering from injuries, illnesses or surgery by employing a range of robotic devices to train lost body functions.\nAccess to advanced robotics in rehabilitation is currently available in hospitals such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital, as well as institutions such as non-profit organisation Stroke Support Station (S3).\nDr Kenny Tan, chief executive officer of healthcare provider St Luke\u2019s ElderCare, said its goal is to support ageing in communities by leveraging advanced technology and robotics, alongside personalised rehabilitation plans developed by its therapists.\n\u201cWe want to ensure as many elders as possible can access the care they need conveniently and comfortably, close to home,\u201d said Dr Tan, who is also an adjunct associate professor of the health and social sciences cluster at the Singapore Institute of Technology.\nConventional physiotherapy focuses on helping patients regain movement, strength and flexibility after injuries, illnesses or surgery, and can be challenging for both patients and physiotherapists.\nProlonged rehabilitation periods may cause patients to get frustrated, on top of facing discomfort during recovery. Doing repetitive exercises can also become boring for patients, leading to decreased motivation.\nPhysiotherapists, on their part, often have to carry out physically demanding tasks, such as assisting patients with exercises or helping them to move around.\nMr Caleb Low, acting head of physiotherapy at St Luke\u2019s ElderCare, said the advanced robotics equipment helps therapists enhance the execution of certain aspects of physiotherapy treatment that are very labour-intensive, such as mobility training.\n\u201cFor example, during the early stages of rehab for a stroke client where we carry out mobility training, which requires two people to assist the patient, it can be physically strenuous for us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo when we put such clients on a machine, it not only makes the whole process safer but also improves the consistency and the quality of the intervention provided.\u201d\nBy introducing game elements such as points and difficulty levels to the process of physiotherapy, the robotics equipment also makes therapy more effective, assisting patients in making precise movements with good control and motivating them to participate actively.\nMr Low said: \u201cOne very big benefit is the element of fun and engagement that is injected into what would otherwise be very repetitive and mundane tasks. At the end of the day, task-specific repetition is actually key to the effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation. So it\u2019s really good to be able to engage them while they execute those repetitions.\u201d\nOne such piece of advanced robotics equipment used in the new Bukit Batok rehabilitation centre is the Armeo Spring Pro machine.\nThe smart robotic device provides constant arm weight support, while the patient moves his or her arm to the left or right to burst balloons in a game that strengthens the patient\u2019s arm."}
