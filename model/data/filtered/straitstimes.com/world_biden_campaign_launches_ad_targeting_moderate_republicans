She\u2019s a very angry person,\u201d Trump is heard saying during the 30-second commercial, punctuated with social media posts in which the Republican claims he \u201cwill not accept\u201d her supporters and threatens to kick them out of his political movement.\nMr Biden posted the video on social media alongside the caption: \u201cNikki Haley voters, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want your vote. I want to be clear: There is a place for you in my campaign.\u201d\nMr Biden has built up a campaign war chest in excess of US$70 million (S$94.3 million) ahead of November\u2019s rematch with Trump, more than doubling his predecessor\u2019s fund-raising haul and giving allies more latitude to spend big on TV advertising. The President raised an estimated US$26 million on March 28 at a New York event with former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\nTrump has had to divide his time between campaign stops and court appearances as he defends himself against 88 felony counts.\nHe has also had to dedicate tens of millions of dollars in donations that could have boosted his campaign on legal fees.\nBut he benefits greatly from free coverage as he turns his many appearances at courthouses into campaign events.\nThe 77-year-old, who has been indicted four times \u2013 mostly over alleged attempts to cheat in elections \u2013 is expected to raise US$33 million from a fund-raiser on April 6 in Florida, according to the Financial Times.\nTrump secured the Republican nomination at the beginning of March after defeating Mrs Haley by wide margins in all the early voting and \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d states \u2013 including her home turf of South Carolina.\nBut large swathes of Republican primary voters \u2013 upwards of 40 per cent in some states \u2013 did not support Trump, raising fears that he will not be able to win the moderates he will need to take back the White House.\nThe TV spot will run for three weeks in eight key battleground states, targeting Mrs Haley voters in predominantly suburban districts where she performed best against Trump.\nThe ad will also appear across a wide array of digital platforms, including those owned by Meta \u2013 parent company of Facebook and Instagram \u2013 and YouTube.\n\u201cAs Trump loses ground, derides women and threatens to ban abortion nationwide \u2013 Joe Biden is reaching across the aisle to Haley voters, inviting them to join his growing and winning coalition of voters who will decide this election,\u201d the President\u2019s campaign said.
