My youngest told me she hopes things stay like this,\" he told AFP.\n\"I used to feel really lonely\" in Tokyo, Mr Kojima said, but he has since realised that \"true balance means not giving up on family\".\nNearly a third of jobs in Japan were done remotely during the first Covid-19 wave in spring 2020, said the Japan Productivity Centre, even though the government never imposed strict stay-at-home orders.\nThe rate has since fallen to 20 per cent, but that is still far higher than before the pandemic, according to quarterly surveys by the non-profit organisation.\nTo encourage telework, the government and some companies made efforts to phase out personalised ink stamps used to certify documents, as well as the ubiquitous fax machine.\nOften in Japan, \"business has to be done in person, on paper\", habits dating back to the 1970s and 80s, when the Japanese economy was booming, said Dr Hiroshi Ono, a professor at Hitotsubashi University, who specialises in human resources.\n\"One of the things Covid has done is bring those barriers down: work doesn't have to be done at the office, men can work at home,\" he told AFP.\nThe couple now mostly do their jobs in communication and marketing remotely from Fujisawa, southwest of the capital, having struggled to both work from home in Tokyo.\n\"It was really Covid that made us take this decision,\" said Mr Kimura, who used to seek out other places to do meetings - at his parents' home or in cafes, remote-work boxes set up in train stations, and even karaoke booths.\n\"Sometimes, you could hear singing from the booth next door,\" which made it difficult to concentrate, recalled the 33-year-old, who is now learning to surf.\nMrs Kimura, 29, thinks \"more and more people are now prioritising their wellbeing, rather than their job\", but questions how quickly things will change on a wider scale.\nThis is a concern shared by Ms Hiromi Murata, an expert at Recruit Works Institute, who says smaller companies may be slower to adapt to new work styles than big firms such as Hitachi, Panasonic or telecoms giant NTT.\nRemote work can also pose a problem for training new recruits, because \"you learn on the job\", Ms Murata said.\n\"Before, it was so important to meet in the office...each business must find a new balance, in their own way and time.\""}
