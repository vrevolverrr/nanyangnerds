Moscow and Teheran oppose any such action by Turkey.\n\u201cMaintaining the territorial integrity of Syria is very important, and any military attack in northern Syria will definitely harm Turkey, Syria and the entire region, and benefit terrorists,\u201d Khamenei told Erdogan before the three-way meeting.\nRussia and Iran are Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest backers, while Turkey supports anti-Assad insurgents.\nAny Turkish operation in Syria would attack the Kurdish YPG militia, a key part of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that controls large parts of north Syria and is regarded by Washington as an important ally against Islamic State militants.\n\u201cIt is impossible to expect Turkey to remain inactive, unresponsive, as this terrorist organisation continues its separatist agenda,\u201d Erdogan said, referring to the YPG.\n\u201cI hear from you, my dear friends, that you understand Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns. I am thankful for this, but words alone are not a cure for wounds.\u201d\nSpeaking at the end of the talks, Putin said the three presidents agreed to continue consultation on Syria and were committed to maintain efforts to \u201cnormalise\u201d the situation there after a decade of conflict.\nPutin, who turns 70 this year, has made few foreign trips in recent years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and then the Ukraine crisis. His last trip beyond the former Soviet Union was to China in February.\nRussia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations are expected to sign a deal later this week aimed at resuming the shipping of grain from Ukraine across the Black Sea.\n\u201cWith your mediation we have moved forward,\u201d Putin told Erdogan after their bilateral meeting. \u201cNot all the issues have been resolved yet, but the fact that there is movement is already good.\u201d"}
