This was down from 49.4 per cent in 2023, 45.8 per cent in 2022, and 72.2 per cent in 2021.\nThis might seem counter-intuitive as 2023 was the hottest year on record globally and 2024 is shaping up to be just as extreme, with devastating floods, storms and heatwaves hitting the region this year.\nEarlier in September, Typhoon Yagi killed hundreds as it swept across northern Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar, damaging or destroying crops and livelihoods.\nThe annual survey of regional climate views also found that nearly 70 per cent of respondents reported experiences of food insecurity, compared with 60 per cent in 2023.\nOf the respondents who experienced some level of food insecurity, 42.5 per cent blamed it on rising food prices, while 28.8 per cent attributed it to climate change.\nThe survey, in its fifth edition since 2020, polled nearly 3,000 people online in all 10 Asean nations between July 10 and Aug 17. Its findings were released on Sept 17.\nDespite the growing toll from extreme weather, the findings show that many in the region are more focused on bread-and-butter concerns, said Ms Sharon Seah, survey lead author and coordinator of the Asean Studies Centre and the Climate Change in South-east Asia Programme at the institute.\n\u201cSince 2022, the region has been buffeted by geopolitical events from the Russia-Ukraine war, South China Sea and the Israel-Gaza conflict. What this means is higher inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, higher energy, food and fertiliser prices, and job insecurity.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe very high-level climate concerns demonstrated in 2021 may have given way to the region\u2019s main preoccupation with bread-and-butter issues, even if climate change is real and has immediate impacts on them.\u201d\nWhile climate change has become a growing threat to the region, there is a risk that people are losing sight of the urgency of the problem, said Mr Choi Shing Kwok, the institute\u2019s chief executive, at the media event on Sept 17 announcing the latest survey results.\n\u201cWithout fail, we have witnessed record-breaking extreme weather every year in almost all inhabitable parts of the world, to the extent that many of us, when we do see these reports, are becoming a bit desensitised. However, here in South-east Asia, at what is arguably the front lines of the climate crisis, we must not lose sight of this threat,\u201d he said.\nBut there is some good news.\nMs Seah pointed to the positive finding that the proportion of people who regard \u201cclimate change as an important issue that deserves to be monitored\u201d increased to 47 per cent in 2024, from 25.7 per cent in 2021 and 41.9 per cent in 2023.\nShe told The Straits Times: \u201cTo me, this is the silent majority who needs to be speaking out and making their concerns known to the governments.\u201d\nLooking ahead, nearly 60 per cent of people in South-east Asia believe their lives will be greatly affected by climate change in the next 10 years, up from 55.7 per cent in 2023. And 73.5 per cent were very concerned or somewhat concerned that a warming world will affect food availability and affordability in the next three years, according to the survey.\nJust over half of the survey respondents believe climate change impacts will negatively affect their health. Respondents from the Philippines (71.5 per cent), Vietnam (61.4 per cent) and Thailand (55.8 per cent) showed the greatest concern. In Singapore, 42.1 per cent felt climate change impacts would affect their health.\nFloods (70.3 per cent), heatwaves (51.8 per cent), and landslides triggered by heavy rain (49.8 per cent) were the top three most serious climate change impacts in the lived climate experiences of people in the region in 2024.\nAbout two-thirds of those polled regarded prolonged drought and heatwaves (68.6 per cent) as the main climate impacts affecting their country\u2019s food availability, followed by floods (62.4 per cent). This reflects the El Nino phenomenon in 2023-2024, which caused drought and raised temperatures in the region.\nIn 2023, floods were viewed as the most serious impact on food availability."}
