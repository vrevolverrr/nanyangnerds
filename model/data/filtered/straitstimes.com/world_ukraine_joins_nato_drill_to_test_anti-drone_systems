The following day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was ramping up drone production tenfold to nearly 1.4 million units in 2024.\nThe proliferation of drones in the war \u2013 to destroy targets and survey the battlefield \u2013 has prompted Nato to increase its focus on the threat they could pose to the alliance.\n\u201cNato takes this threat very, very seriously,\u201d said Mr Matt Roper, chief of the Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Centre at the alliance\u2019s technology agency. \u201cThis is not a domain we can afford to sit back and be passive on,\u201d he said at the exercise site, Lieutenant-General Best Barracks in the east of the Netherlands.\nExperts have warned Nato that it needs to catch up quickly on drone warfare. \u201cNato has too few drones for a high-intensity fight against a peer adversary,\u201d a report from the Centre for European Policy Analysis think-tank declared in September 2023.\n\u201cIt would be severely challenged to effectively integrate those it has in a contested environment.\u201d\nThreat evolution\nThe drills that wrapped up on Sept 19 \u2013 complete with ice cream for onlookers provided by a radar company \u2013 were the fourth annual iteration of the exercise.\nMr Claudio Palestini, the co-chairman of a Nato working group on unmanned systems, said the exercise had adapted to trends such as the transformation of first-person view (FPV) drones \u2013 originally designed for civilian racers \u2013 into deadly weapons.\n\u201cEvery year, we see an evolution of the threat with the introduction of new technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also we see a lot of capabilities (to counter drones) that are becoming more mature.\u201d\nIn a demonstration on Sept 19, two small FPV drones whizzed and whined at high speed through the blue sky to dart around a military all-terrain vehicle before their signal was jammed.\nSuch electronic warfare is widespread in Ukraine. But it is less effective against long-range reconnaissance drones, a technology developer at Ukraine\u2019s Defence Ministry said.\nThe official, giving only his first name of Yaroslav for security reasons, said his team had developed kamikaze drones to destroy such craft \u2013 a much cheaper option than firing missiles, which Ukraine had previously done.\n\u201cYou need to run fast,\u201d he said of the race to counter the impact of drones. \u201cTechnology which you develop is there for three months, maybe six months. After (that), it\u2019s obsolete.\u201d REUTERS"}
