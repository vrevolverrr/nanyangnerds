Travellers from Canada, Mexico, and Germany reached all-time highs for any month.\nThe arrivals from other nations are helping to compensate for a slow recovery in visitors from mainland China, which are still 65 per cent below October 2019 figures. That year, Chinese accounted for nearly a third of all visitors and 40 per cent of all tourist spending in Japan.\nAlmost 20 million visitors have arrived in Japan in the first 10 months of 2023, JNTO data showed, compared to the record of about 32 million in all of 2019.
