The truth emerged when it did not receive the $500 from Chim\u2019s bank account and the police were alerted.\nOn Wednesday, Chim, 29, was sentenced to seven months\u2019 jail after he pleaded guilty to one count of forgery and two drug-related charges.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Sheldon Lim said a quarantine order was issued to Chim on July 30, 2021, for him to be isolated in a room at the Amara Singapore hotel in Tanjong Pagar until Aug 13 that year.\nEven though he was not supposed to leave his room, he did so at around 4pm on Aug 5, 2021, as he wanted to borrow a phone charger.\nHe went to a room occupied by a stranger, who was also under a quarantine order, and the man allowed him inside.\nAt around 9.40pm, a senior guest service manager of the hotel realised that Chim had left his room and found out that he was in another one nearby.\nThe manager accompanied Chim back to his room and told MOH. On Oct 11, 2021, it issued a notice of composition to Chim, stating that he could pay $500 to compound the offence.\nHe sent the edited screenshot via e-mail on Feb 9, 2022, and a senior manager at MOH lodged a police report five months later.\nSeparately, Chim, who has a history of drug abuse, was placed under compulsory supervision from Dec 10, 2021 to Dec 9, 2026.\nHe was supposed to go to Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters for urine tests every Monday, except on public holidays.\nHe repeatedly failed to do so and the police arrested him in November 2022.\nChim is now out on bail of $20,000 and expected to surrender at the State Courts on June 30 to begin serving his sentence."}
