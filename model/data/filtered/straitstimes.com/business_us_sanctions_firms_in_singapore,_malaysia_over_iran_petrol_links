The US said Sense Shipping is a \u201cfront company for Triliance\u201d.\nIn May 2022, Unicious Energy managing director Sabil Siddique told The Straits Times that his company purchased about 80,000 tonnes of marine fuel from United Arab Emirates (UAE) company Desert Oasis Petrochemical Trading, which he valued at around US$50 million (S$66.4 million), with payment already made in full.\nMr Siddique said that this was not the first time Unicious had purchased oil from the UAE-based firm, and that Unicious took delivery of the oil only after it was discharged into a floating storage vessel leased by his company.\nUnicious did not respond to calls and e-mails requesting comment by Bloomberg. Asia Fuel and Sense Shipping could not immediately be reached for comment.\nEarlier in February, a Singapore trading company and its director were among several entities sanctioned by the US over their involvement in a Russian sanctions evasion network that sold helicopters to a Latin American government on behalf of a Russian state-owned firm.
