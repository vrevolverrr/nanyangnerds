It is 22 per cent below the 2023 crop and 15 per cent below the five-year average, the Farm Ministry said.\nIt was revised down from an already weak forecast of 39.3 million hectolitres released in September, which took account of poor weather earlier in 2024. A hectolitre, or 100 litres, is equivalent to 133 standard wine bottles.\n\u201cThis drop is due to unfavourable weather conditions, which impacted all wine-growing areas,\u201d the ministry said in a monthly report.\nAll types of wine are affected, it said, but particularly those from Burgundy, Beaujolais and Champagne.\nThe Champagne crop would be down 33 per cent from 2023 and 14 per cent below the five-year average, while Burgundy and Beaujolais would be down 35 per cent.\nLike other crops, including cereals, grapes have suffered from heavy rainfall in France over the past year.\nThe ministry said many vines had flowered in cool and humid weather, causing millerandage and coulure, conditions in which grapes are small or young grapes and flowers drop off the vine.\n\u201cAdded to this were losses due to frost, mildew and hail.\u201d\nAs a result of the September rainfall, the harvest was brought forward in some regions to limit health risks and additional losses.\nIn July, Champagne producers called for a 12 per cent cut in the number of grapes to be harvested in 2024 after sales of the wine fell more than 15 per cent in the first half of the year.
