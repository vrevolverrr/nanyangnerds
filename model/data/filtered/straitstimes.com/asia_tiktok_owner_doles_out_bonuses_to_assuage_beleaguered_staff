It echoes a handout from Huawei Technologies Co in 2019, another Chinese company in Washington's crosshairs.\nByteDance's workforce, particularly in the US, is concerned about the company's future now that Mr Trump has banned the viral video phenom and prohibited American residents and entities from dealing with TikTok.\nWhile the Commerce Department hasn't defined the scope of that executive order, TikTok's once-sizzling pace of growth is slowing, users are migrating to rival apps such as Triller, and Washington officials continue to label the app a security threat."}
