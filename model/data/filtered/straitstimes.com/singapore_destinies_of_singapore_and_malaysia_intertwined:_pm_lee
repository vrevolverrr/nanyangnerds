Both countries are bound by geography and a shared history, and their people have deep family and cultural ties.\nHe noted that the Causeway and Second Link are among the busiest border crossing points in the world. Over the years, both countries have also broadened cooperation in almost every domain, including in health, education, culture, supply chain and connectivity.\nBoth are each other\u2019s second largest trading partners. Singapore is also the largest foreign investor in Malaysia, with over $56 billion in direct investments.\n\u201cThis reflects our confidence in the Malaysian economy, including the \u2018can-do\u2019 spirit and enterprise of many young and digitally savvy Malaysians,\u201d he said.\nThe partnership between both countries stood up to the test during the Covid-19 pandemic, with ministers and officials keeping in close touch to exchange notes, support one another, and coordinate plans. Even as supply chains across the world were disrupted, people and goods continued to flow safely and smoothly between both countries, he added.\nWith the borders fully reopened, friends and families on both sides of the Causeway can now visit one another freely, and businesses can plan and operate more predictably. And when the Johor Bahru Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link is completed in 2026, travel between both countries will be even easier, he added.\nPM Lee also alluded to the long relationship he has with PM Anwar. The two men first met when they were ministers and have stayed in touch since, he said.\nThe two leaders last met at the Singapore Summit in 2018, where PM Anwar said that if and when he assumed the premiership, Singapore would be one of the first countries he would visit.\nPM Lee said he was therefore glad that he was welcoming PM Anwar to Singapore, and that he looks forward to welcoming him to the Republic again later this year for the annual Leaders\u2019 Retreat.\nPM Anwar, who spoke in English and Malay, called PM Lee a \u201cdear friend\u201d whom he has worked with for decades, and that he is of the view that \u201cno issues should be left unresolved\u201d.\n\u201cI alluded to the fact that the discussions were meaningful \u2013 not normal diplomatic cliches,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were, of course, some more contentious outstanding issues, and I am glad to say that both of us feel that bilateral relations must be enhanced.\u201d\nWhile his administration is very new, PM Anwar said he and his Cabinet team have a clear position when it comes to ties with Singapore.\n\u201cNot only (do) we want to continue the relation, but we want both Singaporeans and Malaysians to understand we are two great countries and two great neighbours (and) that we can do so much more for the benefit of our people,\u201d he said.\nNoting that both countries are still celebrating Chinese New Year, PM Anwar gamely offered greetings in Mandarin, wishing both countries \u201cnian nian hao (good fortune year after year)\u201d.\nHe also said he was pleased that President Halimah Yacob will visit Malaysia soon, a clear signal that bilateral relations are vibrant. Madam Halimah will make a state visit to Malaysia in March, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday."}
