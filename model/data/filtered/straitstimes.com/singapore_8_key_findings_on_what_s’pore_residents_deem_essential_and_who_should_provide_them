Conducted by the Singapore Management University and the Institute of Policy Studies, the surveys shed light on what items and activities Singapore residents think are essential to life here, and who should provide them.\nHere are eight highlights:\n1. Household appliances and digital connectivity deemed most essential\nThe items which most respondents saw as essential included household appliances like refrigerators (100 per cent) and washing machines (96 per cent), as well as items related to digital connectivity, like smartphones with data plans (93 per cent) and home broadband plans (89 per cent).\n2. Air-conditioning, dining out monthly at restaurants also viewed as essential\nHigher-expenditure activities, such as dining out at restaurants at least once a month and an annual holiday to a South-east Asian country, were also seen as essential, albeit by a smaller proportion of respondents, at 62 per cent and 56 per cent respectively.\n3. Private tuition and enrichment, staycations are non-essential\nFewer respondents saw as essential extracurricular lessons for children, such as private tuition (49 per cent) and private enrichment classes (30 per cent), domestic help (33 per cent), and social participation and leisure activities such as an annual staycation (27 per cent) and streaming services (38 per cent).\nThose who earned less or lived in smaller home types were less likely to see these things as essential. The costlier option of private enrichment lessons was deemed essential by fewer respondents, as was private tuition (49 per cent) versus tuition provided by self-help groups (59 per cent).\n5. Most believe that poverty is due to personal actions and circumstance\nA majority of respondents believe people are poor because they face major issues in their lives (80 per cent) or spend money on inappropriate items (72 per cent). Conversely, fewer respondents agreed that poverty is due to external factors such as bad luck (22 per cent) or divine will (17 per cent).\n6. Most feel leisure and social activities should be provided by oneself\nEssential items that most felt should be the primary responsibility of individuals were those related to social participation and leisure, such as an annual holiday to a South-east Asian country and dining out at a restaurant once a month.\nMost respondents felt that the community, relatives and businesses should play a larger role than the Government for household goods such as air-conditioning, and social participation activities, such as family bonding outside of home."}
