Those of us in the services sector that import materials and products will lose even more.\u201d\nThe weak ringgit could add strain to Malaysia Airlines, still recovering from restructuring its debt in 2021, as well as budget carrier AirAsia.\n\u201cThe airline sector is the most exposed to risks due to currency mismatch in operations,\u201d said Mr Xavier Jean, senior director for corporate ratings at S&P in Singapore.\nHe added that the airlines have expenses, including fuel and leases, in US dollars and revenue in ringgit.\n\u201cDebt in these companies is often denominated in dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the double whammy of operating and financial exposure to currency depreciation.\u201d\nMalaysia Airlines declined to comment about the impact of the currency weakness on the company\u2019s bottom line.\nAirAsia Group chief executive officer Tony Fernandes said he is not concerned about the ringgit \u201cas it is mostly sentiment\u201d.\nWhile 70 per cent of the carrier\u2019s costs are paid in US dollars, \u201cwe have good ancillary income and fares are strong\u201d, helping to buffer the company against the weak local currency, he said.\nConstruction companies that depend on imported raw materials, as well as telecommunication firms, whose capital spending is in dollars, also face a financial fallout, S&P said.\nFor Axiata Group, Malaysia\u2019s biggest wireless carrier, the biggest concern is the rising cost of servicing debt. The company has about US$3.6 billion (S$4.8 billion) of US dollar debt.\n\u201cThe real concern is we have a large dollar debt, about 50 per cent of that is hedged already,\u201d said Mr Vivek Sood, the company\u2019s CEO.\nSome companies, such as state-owned oil and gas company Petronas, are in a position to benefit from the plunge in the ringgit.\nA significant amount of its operations is either in the foreign markets or pegged to the dollar, S&P said.\nSime Darby Plantation said the weak ringgit is beneficial for the company because its revenue is in US dollars.\n\u201cThat is actually very promising for us,\u201d said its chief financial officer Renaka Ramachandran."}
