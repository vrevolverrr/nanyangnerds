The US segment is responsible for electricity and life support systems.\nThe US has recently taken strides in gaining an independent propulsion system through Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft, which successfully carried out a re-boost test in late June.\nBut altitude is only a part of the equation: the other is \"attitude\", or orientation.\nCygnus \"can push, but it can't keep the station pointed in the right direction while it pushes\", explained astronomer and space watcher Jonathan McDowell.\nThe ISS itself can make small attitude adjustments, but if the Russians pulled out, the US would need a more permanent solution - perhaps involving the SpaceX Dragon, Northrop Grumman's Cygnus or Orion, said Dr Pace.\nRussia has two propulsion systems: progress spaceships that dock to the station and the Zvezda service module. All of the control systems are handled out of Moscow.\nIt would be helpful if Russia left their segment in place rather than took it with them when they go - one of the station's two bathrooms are on the Russian side - observed Dr Pace, but that is another unknown.\n\"If it's still there, and we wanted to use it, would there be some sort of rental arrangement? I don't know.\"\nWhat do experts predict?\nNasa itself has adopted a bullish position.\n\"We're running and gunning, we're gonna go to 2030 full up,\" Mr Joel Montalbano, Nasa ISS programme manager, said on Tuesday on the morning of the Russian announcement.\n\"Anybody thinks that there's a different plan, you're wrong.\"\nBut while Russia's withdrawal could present a new opportunity for the private sector, Mr McDowell is not so certain.\nFor him, \"how hard they really want to work to get an extra few years out of ISS\" is an open question.\n\"It's maybe not the right move for the US to go to extreme lengths to save (the) Station,\" he said, especially since Nasa has bigger goals of building a lunar space station called Gateway, establishing a Moon presence and going to Mars.\n\"Maybe they should take the Russian pull-out as an excuse, and go, 'okay, bye'. And now let's put our money in Gateway.\""}
