AA denies the charges.\nAA is now bearing down on the border town of Maungdaw, also home to a large Rohingya population, that the Myanmar junta will likely attempt to hold, raising the spectre of more serious violence.\n\u201cWe see clear and present risks of a serious expansion of violence as the battle for neighbouring Maungdaw town has begun, where the military maintains outposts and where a large Rohingya community lives,\u201d said a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe Rohingya have faced decades of persecution and, after a 2017 crackdown by the military, nearly one million fled to Bangladesh, where many now live in crowded refugee camps.\nMr Mohammed Taher, a Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh, said he recently spoke to a friend in Maungdaw, who said the community was living in fear.\n\u201cMany want to flee from Rakhine, but Bangladesh is not opening its door for Rohingya,\u201d Mr Taher said.\nRecent fighting has forced some 45,000 Rohingya to flee to an area along the Naf River on the border, according to a UN estimate.\nA senior Bangladesh border guard official told Reuters last week: \u201cNo Rohingya will be allowed to enter Bangladesh.\u201d\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since a 2021 military coup, which spurred a grassroots armed resistance that is fighting the junta alongside long-established ethnic minority rebel groups.\n\u2018Caught in the middle\u2019\nThe fighting in Rakhine broke out last November when a ceasefire between the AA and the junta collapsed, leading to a string of battlefield successes for the rebels.\nMr Morgan Michaels from the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in a May report: \u201cFaced with mounting losses in Rakhine, the regime has resorted to arming members of the Rohingya ethnic minority to counter the Arakan Army\u2019s advance.\n\u201cThe AA has reacted with inflammatory rhetoric and violence directed at the Rohingya.\u201d\nAmid the renewed conflict, Rohingya civilians are \u201cincreasingly being caught in the middle\u201d, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in its latest report last week.\nThe agency estimates that over 350,000 people are displaced across Rakhine after years of conflict, many of whom do not have access to basic services.\nMedical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said: \u201cWe are witnessing a near-total absence of humanitarian assistance for communities who rely on it.\u201d It added that hospitals in Buthidaung and Maungdaw were closed.\nAA, which has a goal to form an autonomous state, has warned that more battles are coming, asking civilians in Buthidaung, Maungdaw and Thandwe to dig bomb shelters or evacuate to safer areas.\nThe group, which has denied it targeted the Rohingya, has also asked for international aid for some 200,000 internally displaced people that it says are sheltering in areas under its control in Buthidaung and Maungdaw.\nMr Scot Marciel, a former US ambassador to Myanmar, said: \u201cThe situation is incredibly fraught and dangerous.\n\u201cIn some ways, this is an early test of whether a post-military rule Rakhine state with significant autonomy can work.\u201d REUTERS"}
