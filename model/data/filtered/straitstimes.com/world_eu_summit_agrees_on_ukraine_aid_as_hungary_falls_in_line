Unity,\u201d said European Council president Charles Michel in a post on X. \u201cAll 27 leaders agreed on an additional \u20ac50 billion support package for Ukraine within the EU budget.\u201d\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the agreement, saying the aid would strengthen the long-term economic and financial stability of his country as the war with Russia approaches its third year.\nUkraine's dollar bonds gained on the news. Kyiv, which relies heavily on Western aid as it fights Moscow, said it expected to receive the first tranche of \u20ac4.5 billion (S$6.53 billion) from the EU in March.\nThe agreement comes after weeks of wrangling with Mr Orban, who vetoed the aid package in December 2023. There was no comment from Hungary on the deal.\nDiplomats told Reuters that, in exchange for Hungary\u2019s green light for the Ukraine aid, the bloc did not commit to releasing any of the billions of euros of EU funds intended for Hungary but frozen by Brussels over widespread concerns about human rights and the rule of law in the country.\nThey said the aid deal included a yearly discussion of the package and the option to review it in two years \u201cif needed\u201d, but no clear veto right for Budapest.\nWith an agreement on budget support done, the leaders were next discussing military aid for Kyiv.\nThe bloc is seen falling short of its target of sending artillery shells to Ukraine, while a stand-off between Germany \u2013 the EU\u2019s paymaster \u2013 and other member states casts uncertainty over the future of a military aid fund that has bankrolled billions of euros in arms for Ukraine.\nBefore the summit began, leaders of Germany, Poland, Belgium and Finland were among others to say on Feb 1 that it was crucial the 27-nation bloc agreed as one to offer aid to Kyiv from their joint budget through 2027.\nMr Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Moscow, has stepped up criticism of the EU\u2019s strategy to prop up Ukraine with financial and military aid.\nOn Feb 1, he posted pictures of himself on social media walking around tractors ahead of a farmers\u2019 protest in Brussels.\nHe and an aide to Mr Michel posted pictures of groups of leaders seemingly discussing a draft agreement in separate huddles before they all met behind closed doors.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz had made clear what the expectation of the other 26 EU countries was on Feb 1, saying the EU is \u201ca community in which all stand in solidarity\u201d.\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the time for Mr Orban\u2019s \u201cgames\u201d was over: \u201cHe has to consider if he is in, or out.\u201d"}
