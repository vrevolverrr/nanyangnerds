The survey was conducted from Monday to Thursday, and published on Friday.\nMr McCarthy would plan a trip to the island either later in 2023 or in 2024, said House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul on Tuesday \u2013 an event that would set up a potential confrontation similar to the one in August 2022. Mr McCaul, also a Republican, said he plans to lead a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan this spring.\nLast August, Mrs Nancy Pelosi became the first House speaker in 25 years to visit Taipei, where she met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. The People\u2019s Liberation Army responded by holding unprecedented military drills around the island.\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunified, by force if necessary, and it views visits by foreign government officials as them recognising the island\u2019s sovereignty.\nTaiwan rejects China\u2019s sovereignty claims, saying that only the island\u2019s 23 million people can decide their future.\nChina has urged Mr McCarthy not to make the journey. Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said in January that \u201ccertain individuals in the US\u201d should \u201cstop doing anything that violates the basic norms in international relations\u201d.\nMs Mao did not refer to Mr McCarthy by name, but she was answering a question at a regular media briefing about him making a potential visit.\nAsked later to respond to those comments, Mr McCarthy said: \u201cI don\u2019t think China can tell me where I can go, at any time, at any place.\u201d BLOOMBERG, REUTERS"}
