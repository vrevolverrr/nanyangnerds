In violation of international law, they were deprived of liberty in the woman\u2019s home and prevented from leaving,\u201d Ms Devgun said.\nThe accused, who in 2020 returned to Sweden where she is currently serving time in prison for other offences in Syria, denies the new charges, her lawyer Mikael Westerlund said.\nUnder Swedish law, courts can try people for crimes against international law committed abroad.\nThe prosecution agency said crimes against humanity can include murder, rape, torture and forced labour if they are part of a widespread or systematic attack against a group of civilians.\nIn 2022, a Swedish court found the same woman guilty of war crimes and violation of international law for failing to prevent her 12-year-old son from becoming a child soldier in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa when it was under ISIS rule.
