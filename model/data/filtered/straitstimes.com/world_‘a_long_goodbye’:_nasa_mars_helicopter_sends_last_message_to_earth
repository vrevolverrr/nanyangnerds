That led to the flight computer freezing over and forced engineers to devise new protocols.\nNasa said on April 15 it was attempting to bring Martian rocks collected by the Perseverance rover back to Earth faster and more cheaply, with the agency facing mounting criticism for going massively over budget.\nThe effort comes as China is making progress towards a simpler \u201cgrab-and-go\u201d sample return mission to the red planet \u201caround 2030\u201d, according to state media, which would make it the first nation to achieve the feat.
