Approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s, characterised by memory loss and declining mental acuity.\nLeqembi, also known by its drug name lecanemab, is an antibody treatment that is injected into the brain every two weeks and works by reducing amyloid beta, a protein that builds into plaques and causes brain cells to die, as well as brain shrinkage."}
