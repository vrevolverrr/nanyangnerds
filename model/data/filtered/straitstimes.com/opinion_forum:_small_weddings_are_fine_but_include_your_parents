Or disappointed that they did not measure up to be on the select list of wedding guests? As parents, why do they even need to \u201cmake the cut\u201d?\nTo add insult to injury, Ms Ho said: \u201cI just wanted to be with the people I loved, the ones who would be genuinely happy for us.\u201d\nI am not sure if this behaviour of cutting your parents out of your wedding to save money should be endorsed.\nA wedding is an important life event and for the ones who brought you into the world, a momentous occasion.\nIt is not \u201ca small thing\u201d as it marks the start of your marriage and you would want your parents\u2019 blessing.\nExcluding them from the start just to spend less doesn\u2019t seem wise. Honestly, you do not save much but lose much more in the long run."}
