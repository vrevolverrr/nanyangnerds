What\u2019s more certain: The hype around Q* has boosted excitement about the company\u2019s engineering prowess, just as it\u2019s steadying itself from a failed board coup.\nPeaks of AI excitement about milestones have taken the public for a ride plenty of times before. The real warning we should take from Q* is the direction in which these systems are progressing. As they get better at reasoning, it will become more tempting to give such tools greater responsibilities. More than any concerns about AI annihilation, that alone should give us pause."}
