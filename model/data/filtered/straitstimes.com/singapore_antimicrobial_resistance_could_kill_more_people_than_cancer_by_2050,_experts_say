He added: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing resources on sources of drivers of infectious disease.\u201d\nWellcome Trust is supporting the network with more than $10 million. Five institutes here \u2013 the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University, and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases \u2013 have each contributed $500,000, adding another $2.5 million. This money is for the 2022 to 2024 period, after which more funding is expected.\nProf Paterson said it makes sense to have clinical trials for new antibiotics or preventive strategies carried out in Asia, as almost half of the five million AMR deaths in 2019 were in this region. Hospitals that participate in the trials have the opportunity to gain access to new drugs.\nProfessor Kenneth Mak, Singapore\u2019s director of medical services, who gave the opening address at the symposium on Monday, described AMR as \u201ca slow-burn pandemic\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cIts impact on our healthcare systems and communities can be profound. Pathogens resistant to the already limited antibiotic options we have today can lead to poorer patient outcomes and greater difficulty in treatment. This could result in a longer hospital stay and higher overall healthcare costs.\u201d\nProf Mak said the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that infectious diseases, including the threat of AMR, \u201ceasily transcend borders in today\u2019s highly connected world\u201d.\nInfectious pathogens can emerge in one place and ride on humans, animals and other vectors such as food and surfaces, ending up in a vastly distant location compared with its original source, he added.\n\u201cAn outbreak can be seeded in such a manner, and where scientific developments have not caught up with a new and emerging pathogen, this is when epidemics and pandemics can occur.\u201d\nProf Paterson said that at some hospitals in the new network, half of the bacterial infections in patients in the ICU are resistant to carbapenem. Such resistance is also found here but accounts for less than 10 per cent of those infected, he added.\nWhen that happens, doctors have to fall back on a very old antibiotic called colistin, which infectious diseases doctors have stopped using for about 40 years because of its high toxicity that commonly causes kidney and neurological problems.\nBacteria have no resistance to colistin because it has not been in use for decades. But its toxicity makes it a drug of last resort that doctors would prefer not to use.\nThat is why it is so important to develop new antibiotics, which have to be tested. This is what the network hopes to facilitate.\n\u201cWe desperately need alternatives. That\u2019s our No. 1 priority for trials of alternatives to colistin,\u201d said Prof Paterson. \u201cAlready, we\u2019ve got such a pipeline of people wanting to do projects with us. It\u2019s quite amazing.\u201d\nThe great interest in the network is fuelled by the war in Ukraine. Prof Paterson said: \u201cCompanies used to do a lot of their trial work in Ukraine and Russia, and they now need new venues for their trials. I know it\u2019s a horrible circumstance to have this opportunity. But it is a huge opportunity for us to take.\u201d\nThe network will pick two or three out of the dozen potential drugs to test, with the first multi-hospital trial expected to start later in 2023."}
