We will not hesitate to act if needed.\"\nReynders said the dismissal of Judicial Council members and plans to dissolve the Special Prosecutor Office as well as decrease penalties for corruption-related criminal offences raised concerns, including over judicial independence.\nSlovak President Zuzana Caputova has threatened to veto the legislation, while opposition parties have promised to do all they can to block it in parliament. On Tuesday, thousands protested in Bratislava and other cities over the proposals.\nFico's government aims to enact by Christmas legislation that would disband the special prosecutor's office.\nFico, a four-time prime minister who resigned in 2018 amid mass protests against corruption after the murder of an investigative journalist, leads a coalition with a sufficient majority in parliament to overturn a presidential veto.\nHe has accused the special prosecutor's office of being politically motivated and has said it violated human rights.\nSince 2020, the special prosecutor has investigated over 100 people including police, judicial officials and influential businessmen. Another 40 people have been found guilty, according to Slovak media. REUTERS"}
