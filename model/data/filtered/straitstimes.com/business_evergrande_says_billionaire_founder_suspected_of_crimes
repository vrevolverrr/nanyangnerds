Evergrande has 2.39 trillion yuan (S$454 billion) in liabilities.\nThe 64-year-old has been a Communist Party member for more than three decades.\nIn 2008, he was elected to join the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an elite group comprising government officials and the biggest names in business. He later secured two other five-year terms.\nThings took a turn for the worse in 2021, when Evergrande officially became a defaulter and the authorities from its home province of Guangdong led what is poised to be one of the nation\u2019s biggest debt restructuring processes.\nMr Hui had been part of the CPPCC\u2019s elite 300-member standing committee since 2013, but he was told not to attend the annual convention in March 2022 as his property group became the biggest casualty of the nation\u2019s credit crunch."}
