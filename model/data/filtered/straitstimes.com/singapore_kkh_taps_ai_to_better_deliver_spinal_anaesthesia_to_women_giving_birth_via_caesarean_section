This involves locating the correct needle insertion spot and angle.\nTypically, a doctor uses his hands to feel for spinal landmarks to identify the spot for needle insertion, which is in the lower spine, between the L3 and L4 lumbar vertebrae.\n\u201cThis requires good knowledge of the anatomy, skills and experience due to the complexity of the procedure\u2026 This is usually very challenging in patients with high body mass index because the spinal structures will not be that obvious,\u201d said Associate Professor Sng.\nStudies have shown that about 10 per cent of women in Singapore are obese during pregnancy.\nThe manual method has a success rate of about 70 per cent in women with healthy weight, and 43 per cent for women who are obese, for achieving spinal anaesthesia at the first attempt.\nWith the new system, the success rate has jumped to 92 per cent for women in the healthy weight range, and 82 per cent in obese women.\nuSine uses a proprietary machine learning algorithm, which has been trained with images of spinal structures to identify anatomical landmarks.\nDoctors use the ultrasound system, scanning a patient\u2019s spine vertically and horizontally to look for the right spot for injection. Upon detection, the machine plays a short tune to alert the anaesthetist to the location and angle of insertion for the needle.\nProf Sng said the technology will benefit the majority of patients giving birth via caesarean section, as they would need spinal anaesthesia.\nBeing able to get the injection right the first time \u201cimproves the quality of anaesthesia and reduces complications such as nerve irritation, blood collection within the tissues in the spine or, in rare cases, neurological injury\u201d, he added.\nKKH performs more than 3,500 spinal anaesthesia procedures each year.\nClinical trials involving about 200 patients started in 2017, and were funded by grants from the National Health Innovation Centre and National Medical Research Council.\nuSine was eventually implemented in KKH in May 2023, and is licensed to HiCura Medical for commercialisation.\nProf Sng said there are plans to introduce the system to other healthcare institutions in Singapore, starting with those within SingHealth as early as this year.\nTrials are also planned for Australia, the United States and Europe."}
