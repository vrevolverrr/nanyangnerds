All races were then suspended from April 4.\nCRFs are meant for patients who remain well at the end of their 14th day of illness and who do not require further medical care.\nOther facilities include those at Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps - Amoy Quee, Bedok, Jurong, Guillemard, Lim Chu Kang and Tanjong Gul - which started taking in patients on April 28.\nThe authorities had announced on April 28 that more than 10,000 bed spaces will be available at such facilities by the end of June.\nSuch facilities are part of a strategy to provide differentiated care to Covid-19 patients with different needs, alongside hospitals and community care facilities (CCFs). CCFs are for those with mild symptoms and lower risk factors."}
