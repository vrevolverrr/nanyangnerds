He has signalled his focus on improving health and education outcomes with a plan to give out free school lunches and milk to more than 80 million children. He also expects to create employment for women and small businesses.\nHis campaign also called for \u201cyouth downstreaming\u201d as a way to urge young people to take up higher-paying tech-related jobs.\nA spokesperson for Mr Prabowo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMr Prabowo\u2019s current line-up may be all men, but plans might change, the people said.\nDiscussions to shape Mr Prabowo\u2019s new Cabinet are under way, but they are still at an early stage and will intensify only after he is officially declared the winner and president-elect by the General Elections Commission, they said.\nOfficial results are due by March 20.\nHere\u2019s more on the potential contenders:\nBudi Gunadi Sadikin\nAppointed as health minister in December 2020, Mr Budi was largely credited for curbing the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia by tapping international networks and domestic resources to procure tests and vaccines. He was previously deputy minister of state-owned enterprises.\nA nuclear physics graduate from one of Indonesia\u2019s top universities, Bandung Institute of Technology, Mr Budi\u2019s private-sector career took off at IBM Asia-Pacific. He was an information technology officer before embarking on a banking career that started at Bank Bali and took him to become president director at Bank Mandiri, the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. He was president of Indonesia Asahan Aluminium before leaving the private sector for the government.\nRoyke Tumilaar\nMr Royke also helmed Bank Mandiri from 2019 to 2020 after holding various positions in departments ranging from wholesale and corporate banking to asset management.\nHe had first joined the bank in 1998 following the Asian financial crisis, after starting his banking career as a credit analyst at Bank Dagang Negara. After leaving Mandiri, he joined Bank Negara Indonesia as president director.\nMr Royke holds an economics degree from the University of Trisakti and a master\u2019s degree in business finance from the University of Technology Sydney.\nKartika Wirjoatmodjo\nMr Kartika took over as president director of Bank Mandiri from Mr Budi. Prior to that, he was the chief executive of Deposit Insurance Corp and also led Indonesia Infrastructure Finance. In 2019, he was brought in to become deputy minister of state-owned enterprises.\nMr Kartika holds an accounting degree from the country\u2019s top institution, University of Indonesia, and received his MBA from Erasmus University Rotterdam in 2001.\nMahendra Siregar\nMr Mahendra is an economist by training, and no stranger to the Finance Ministry. He was deputy finance minister under former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono between 2011 and 2013, and was formerly deputy minister for foreign affairs and trade.\nHe had also been Indonesia\u2019s ambassador to the US. Since 2022, Mr Mahendra has helmed the Financial Services Authority, which oversees regulations in the banking and capital markets sectors.\nHe has an economics degree from the University of Indonesia and a master\u2019s degree in the same subject from Monash University.
