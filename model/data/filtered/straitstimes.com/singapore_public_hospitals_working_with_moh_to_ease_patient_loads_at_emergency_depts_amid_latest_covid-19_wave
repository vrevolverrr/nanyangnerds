The safety and care of our patients remain our utmost priority. Patients requiring care will continue to be attended to.\u201d\nThe statement came a day after The Straits Times reported that there was a bed crunch at several public hospitals, with some ambulances waiting for up to 30 minutes before they can offload patients because there are no beds available.\nThe healthcare clusters said the hospitals offer alternative arrangements for patients when appropriate, such as tele-consultation, remote monitoring and delivery of medication.\nHowever, longer waiting time in emergency departments is expected, and priority will be given to patients with more serious conditions, the statement added.\n\u201cPatients with potentially life-threatening or medically urgent conditions will be attended to quickly, and sicker patients who require close monitoring will get a bed sooner based on acuity and priority. Those with lower acuity conditions will experience a longer wait time to transfer to the ward.\u201d\nHospitals are also seeing a high number of patients who do not require emergency care. Thus, people, including children, should not visit the emergency department unless it is for life-threatening conditions, the statement said.\n\u201cFor common and minor medical conditions, they should visit general practitioners and polyclinics or consider teleconsultation with their doctor.\n\u201cPatients who walk into emergency departments with non-emergency conditions may be diverted to other urgent care clinics or primary care clinics for further assessment, to prioritise emergency department resources for patients who truly need acute hospital care.\u201d"}
