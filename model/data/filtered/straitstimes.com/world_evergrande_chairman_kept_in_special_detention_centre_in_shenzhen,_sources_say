Evergrande was ordered into liquidation in January.\nMr Hui, who was once China\u2019s richest man, is not known to have been formally charged with any crimes, and it is unclear how long he will remain in detention or whether he will be tried or set free.\nThe Chinese authorities have detained many former high-flying business executives, and some have remained in detention for years with little or no information about their fate.\nThe property tycoon was initially under house surveillance in Beijing after his arrest, according to one of the sources.\nHe was transferred to Shenzhen a few months ago to allow him to more easily communicate with top Evergrande executives, said the second source. Evergrande is headquartered in the neighbouring southern city of Guangzhou, and its wealth management unit is based in Shenzhen.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Public Security and the Shenzhen municipal government did not respond to Reuters requests for comment, nor did Hengda Real Estate, Evergrande\u2019s main unit.\nMr Hui founded Evergrande in 1996, transforming it into China\u2019s biggest property developer in terms of contracted sales, aggressively taking on debt.\nSince 2021, the company has defaulted on most of its US$300 billion liabilities, as well as billions of dollars of wealth management product payments, and its troubles have been emblematic of China\u2019s property sector woes that have long dragged on economic growth.\nIn March, a regulatory probe found an Evergrande unit inflated revenue by 564 billion yuan (S$103 billion) during 2019-2020 and issued bonds based on falsified statements.\nWealth management payments\nAccording to the second source, Mr Hui is in \u201cgood shape\u201d and has access to medical care and good food at the special detention centre. Detainees at special detention centres typically receive better treatment than at ordinary detention centres.\nMr Hui wrote a letter to senior Evergrande executives after being sent to the centre, urging them to resolve the non-payment of returns to investors in its wealth management products as soon as possible, the source added.\nEvergrande\u2019s wealth management unit announced plans in late 2021 to repay investors in its wealth management products.\nBut in August 2023, it said it was no longer able to make the monthly instalments. Some of the unit\u2019s staff were detained by the Shenzhen police a couple of weeks later.\nThe two sources also said Evergrande is close to handing over most homes that have been promised to buyers, adding that more than 70 per cent of the construction is completed for those apartments.\nThey did not provide details on how many apartments that might mean. Evergrande had nearly 800 projects across the country as of 2022. REUTERS"}
