A source speaking on condition of anonymity told AFP Babel\u2019s report was accurate, adding that Mrs Budanova had been poisoned and was receiving treatment, but declined to give further details.\nBabel reported that the substances found in her body \u201care not used in normal life or military affairs\u201d.\n\u201cTheir presence may indicate a deliberate poisoning attempt,\u201d it said.\nIt also said \u201cseveral\u201d other employees of GUR, the military intelligence service, were being treated for suspected poisoning.\nMr Yusov confirmed to AFP that traces of heavy metals had been found in other employees, but declined to say how many.\n\u2018Over time\u2019\nMs Budanova was reportedly hospitalised after her condition deteriorated and has already undergone some treatment.\nIt is not clear when she fell ill, but Mr Yusov told AFP that the assassination attempt \u201ccould have been stretched over time\u201d.\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk about the timing now,\u201d he said.\nLaw enforcement officials believe the poison was administered through her food, news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported.\nRussia has been accused of poisoning attacks before, although the Kremlin has firmly denied the charges.\nIn 2018, a former Russian military intelligence officer convicted by Moscow of high treason was poisoned along with his daughter in Britain.\nAssassinations are not unheard of in the Ukraine war.\nSeveral pro-Russian officials and supporters of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have been assassinated since Russia launched its full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022.\nOfficials said they have foiled \u201cmore than 10\u201d assassination attempts against Lt-Gen Budanov, a highly respected figure in Ukraine.\nLt-Gen Budanov\u2019s influential military intelligence unit is considered responsible for several sabotage attacks against Russia that have taken place behind the front lines.\nMoscow has accused the GUR of being behind the October 2022 explosions on the Kerch bridge, which links Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula.\nLt-Gen Budanov said in August his wife had been living with him \u201cin his office\u201d.\nHe said she had not left his side since the start of the invasion for security purposes.
