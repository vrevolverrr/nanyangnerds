Instead, looking at a treatment's effectiveness and customising the optimal dose for them throughout their treatment cycle could prolong the period in which the patient remains responsive to treatment.\nFor some, these doses may potentially be lower than the high doses that are traditionally used, said Prof Ho.\nTo prove that Curate.AI can work in real-world settings, the NUS team embarked on a clinical trial, called Precise.Curate, from August 2020 to April this year.\nThe trial, conducted in collaboration with clinicians from the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS), which is part of the National University Health System, involved 10 patients with advanced solid tumours, many of whom had stage-four colorectal cancer.\nSolid tumour cancers include cancers of the breast, lung, prostate, colon, bladder and kidney.\nCurate.AI harnesses a patient's clinical data, which includes the chosen drug type, dose and cancer biomarkers to generate an individualised digital profile which is then used to customise the optimal doses during chemotherapy.\nDr Agata Blasiak, head of digital innovation at NUS' N.1 Institute for Health, as well as the presenting author and co-corresponding author of the study, said the clinicians were then permitted to accept or reject the dose recommendations based on their clinical judgment.\nEven then, close to 97 per cent of the dose recommendations were accepted, and some patients were prescribed optimal chemotherapy doses that were around 20 per cent lower on average, compared with a standard dose.\nThe trial was kept as realistic as possible to ensure that it would still be viable in real-world clinical settings.\nFor instance, some patients chose to skip their chemotherapy treatment, for reasons such as unbearable side effects, Dr Blasiak noted.\nCurate.AI is able to incorporate these decisions and to fine-tune the dosing recommendations accordingly.\nDr Raghav Sundar, a principal investigator of the trial and a consultant at NCIS' Department of Haematology-Oncology, said a key aim of the trial was to empower clinicians to identify the optimal dose for each patient, without adding to their workload. In this way, clinicians can focus more on the patient and caregiver, he noted.\nSaid Prof Ho: \"This is a milestone from our early-stage data in showing the feasibility of integrating AI into treatment and hospital workflows. Having lower doses of a drug could also pave the way for lower treatment costs.\"\nThe results of the pilot trial were presented on Sunday (June 5) at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) annual meeting in Chicago to showcase the latest advancements in cancer research.\nAsco is a leading professional organisation for healthcare practitioners who care for people with cancer.\nThe NUS team will now advance towards larger, randomised trials to further validate the performance of the optimisation platform.\nNoting that a growing number of cancer patients are being treated with immunotherapy - which involves harnessing the body's immune system to fight cancer, Prof Ho said future trials will also incorporate this form of treatment.\nThe research team will also be conducting clinical trials involving patients with other types of cancers, like blood cancer, as well as other diseases like high blood pressure."}
