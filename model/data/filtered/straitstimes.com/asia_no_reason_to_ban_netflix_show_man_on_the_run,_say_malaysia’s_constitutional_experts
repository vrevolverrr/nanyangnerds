They were sentenced to death.\nGiven that the 1MDB case has been widely reported worldwide for about 10 years, Prof Shad Saleem said banning such a documentary would not be sensible, adding that the country should put its trust in the judiciary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know about 1MDB and all the allegations. There have also been court trials in other countries, and this has been going around for many years,\u201d he added.\nOn the arguments that the documentary could be deemed defamatory to former prime minister Najib Razak, he said there was a difference between \u201cdefamatory\u201d and \u201cdenigratory\u201d.\n\u201cIf you see someone short and you call him \u2018hello shorty\u2019, that is not defamation, it is an insult. It is not proper, but it is not a crime.\n\u201cThe difference is that if you paint someone in a bad light, but it is the truth, then it is denigratory.\n\u201cSo, if Najib\u2019s lawyers believe it is defamatory, they should take it to court and see if it will issue an injunction (on the documentary).\n\u201cHowever, can the injunction be enforced? Netflix is an international streaming platform and this will be a challenge because Section 3(3) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 does not permit censorship of the Internet.\n\u201cThis is the age of information. How in the world do you stop information from reaching judges, lawyers, prosecutors and the public?\u201d\nProfessor Nik Ahmad Kamal Nik Mahmood of International Islamic University Malaysia said instead of making the sub judice arguments publicly, the relevant parties should leave it to the courts to decide.\nSince the argument on sub judice could go both ways, a neutral party must make the decision, he said.\n\u201cAnd that (neutral party) is the courts. The term \u2018sub judice\u2019 first and foremost means that the matter is already in court and whatever reported or shown is something that may affect the judgment of the judge.\n\u201cAnyone can say something is sub judice or not. In this case, all of the information shared (in the documentary) is in the public domain and from the earlier trials, so these are the arguments that the defence can use to say it is not sub judice,\u201d he said.\nThe 98-minute documentary Man On The Run was first screened in Malaysian cinemas on Oct 19, 2023, and appeared on Netflix on Jan 5.\nThe documentary highlights fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, and his dealings with the controversial 1MDB, and features interviews with Najib and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\nNajib\u2019s lawyers have called for the removal of the documentary from Netflix, claiming that the show is defamatory, biased, sub judice, offensive and in contempt of court in light of the former premier\u2019s ongoing 1MDB trial.\nWhile Datuk Seri Anwar said the government would look into the request, Lawyers For Liberty said it would be unlawful for Putrajaya to remove the documentary given that the issue is currently under the jurisdiction of the courts.
