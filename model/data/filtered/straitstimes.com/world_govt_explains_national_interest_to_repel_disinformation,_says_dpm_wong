Not because of choosing sides or... external influence, but really because of Singapore\u2019s own interest.\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time doing that,\u201d he said.\nHe also said it helped that a distinct Singaporean identity, different from cultures in other countries, had evolved over time.\n\u201cThe majority of our population are ethnic Chinese, so we have ancestral roots going back to China, but we have, over time, evolved our own Singaporean identity.\n\u201cWe are Singaporean Chinese, and the Singaporean Chinese is very different from the Chinese from China \u2013 in values, in outlook, in identity. Just as a Singaporean Malay would be very different from a Malay from Malaysia or Indonesia, or a Singaporean Indian would be very different from someone who comes from India.\n\u201cAmerica, being a nation of immigrants, you must understand this very well,\u201d he said,\nAnd influence percolated not just from China; Singapore was equally influenced by ideas originating in the West. A large proportion of Singaporeans consume English-language news and entertainment from the US and Britain, he pointed out.\n\u201cThere is no shortage of criticism about Singapore in the Western media, no shortage of commentaries and articles highlighting the shortcomings in our system and asking us to be more like Western liberal ideals.\u201d\nBut the country steered its own course, he said.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what is important for us, small though we may be, is that we are our own people, we make our own choices.\n\u201cIt really comes down to Singaporeans deciding on the future of our country.\n\u201cNot China nor the West.\u201d\nHe was also asked to react to a report published in The Washington Post in July which alleged that Lianhe Zaobao was peddling China\u2019s propaganda.\nMr Wong said the Chinese-language newspaper had defended its editorial stance and strongly rejected the portrayal by the Post.\n\u201cIf you were to ask Singaporeans, the vast majority of Singaporeans reading the Chinese newspaper daily will not feel that what was portrayed in The Washington Post was accurate,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBecause we can read and see for ourselves articles on China, and they cover a wide range, including many articles that criticise Singapore\u2019s perspectives as they have to reflect our society.\u201d\nThis is as it should be, he added.\n\u201cOur newspapers cannot resemble The Washington Post, neither do we ask The Washington Post to become like Singapore newspapers.\u201d"}
