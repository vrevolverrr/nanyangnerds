Go back and connect to station power.\u201d\nArtemyev returned to the airlock and connected his suit to the space station\u2019s power.\nThe flight controller warned Artemyev that he risked losing power to his suit\u2019s oxygen pump, and contact with mission control, if he did not immediately return to the airlock for power.\nNasa spokesman Rob Navias said Artemyev \u201cwas never in any danger.\u201d\nRussian flight controllers opted to call off the spacewalk early once Denis Matveev, the other cosmonaut performing the spacewalk, gathered his tools and positioned the robotic arm they had been upgrading back into its normal position.\nUpon Matveev\u2019s return, the spacewalk ended after four hours, at 1.54pm ET (1.54am on Thursday, Singapore time)."}
