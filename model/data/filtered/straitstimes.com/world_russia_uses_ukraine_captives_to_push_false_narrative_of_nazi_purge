Russia has said that 959 soldiers in the plant surrendered, about 800 of them from the Azov battalion. It is believed that up to 1,000 more soldiers remain inside the plant.\nMs Maria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Azov soldiers had committed war crimes by using kindergartens and medical centres to store ammunition and by using civilians as human shields - accusations that echoed those levelled against Russian troops by the West.\nSome of the prisoners were transferred to pre-trial detention in the town of Yelenovka, in the Russia-controlled eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, Ms Zakharova said. She accused Ukraine's forces of having fired rockets at the facility that held them.\nMs Zakharova said she had no information about a prisoner exchange with Ukraine and that those requiring medical attention were receiving it. Russia released a video of hospitalised captive soldiers in a separatist-held city east of Mariupol.\nLegal experts said war crimes prosecutions against senior commanding officers are more difficult and can take far longer because their connections to the crime must be proved in court. In this case, Shyshimarin had been accused of actually firing the fatal shot.\nThe prosecution was extraordinary partly because it proceeded despite its potential to disrupt or even halt future prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia.\n\"The Russians may now decide to bring cases against Ukrainian POWs,\" said Prof Alex Whiting, a war crimes prosecutor who is a visiting professor at Harvard Law School.\n\"This shows how the atrocity crimes being committed by Russian forces, and Ukraine's commitment to prosecute them, are so much the centre of attention right now.\"\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor in the trial, Mr Andriy Sinyuk, described it as an \"unprecedented procedure\" in which \"a serviceman of a different country is accused of murdering a civilian of Ukraine\".\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the proceedings, telling reporters that the accusations levelled against Russian soldiers by Ukraine were \"simply fake or staged\".\n\"We still have no information,\" Mr Peskov said. \"And the ability to provide assistance due to the lack of our diplomatic mission there is also very limited.\"\nEven as Turkey raised concerns about quickly admitting Sweden and Finland to Nato, President Joe Biden on Wednesday formally endorsed both applications. He also issued a carefully worded warning to Russia that the United States would help defend both countries while their applications are pending.\nIn blocking an early procedural vote on the applications, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seemed to be calculating that his cooperation was at a premium at a moment of global crisis. Nato operates by consensus, giving any member political leverage over key decisions.\nDr Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute, said Mr Erdogan was likely angling for concessions before a Nato summit in June, and was likely looking for Sweden to take a stronger stand against Kurdish groups that Turkey regards as linked to the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, which launched a violent separatist movement in Turkey in the early 1980s.\nMr Erdogan may also be seeking to unlock sales of American F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, Dr Cagaptay said.\nIn an address to lawmakers in Turkey's Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Erdogan said the outpouring of support for Ukraine, which he has generally supported, was \"bittersweet\".\n\"Because we, as a Nato ally who struggled with terror for years, whose borders were harassed, big conflicts occurred just next door, have never seen such a picture,\" he said.\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu signalled that his country would not stop Sweden and Finland from joining Nato and would work to \"overcome the differences through dialogue and diplomacy\".\n\"We understand their security concerns, but Turkey's security concerns should be also met,\" Mr Cavusoglu told Secretary of State Antony Blinken before a meeting at the United Nations in New York."}
