Some lawmakers cited China\u2019s comments to reject TikTok\u2019s contention that it is separate from the Chinese government.\nAt Thursday\u2019s House hearing, Representative Neal Dunn asked Mr Chew if ByteDance has spied on Americans at Beijing\u2019s request. Mr Chew answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\nRepublican Mr Dunn then asked about US media reports that a China-based team at ByteDance planned to use TikTok to monitor the location of specific US citizens, and repeated his question about whether ByteDance was spying.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that spying is the right way to describe it,\u201d Mr Chew said. He went on to describe the reports as involving an \u201cinternal investigation\u201d, but was cut off by Mr Dunn, who called TikTok\u2019s widespread use \u201ca cancer\u201d.\nShares of US social media companies that compete with TikTok for advertising rose on Thursday, with Facebook parent Meta Platforms up 1.8 per cent and Snap up 2.8 per cent.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives on Twitter he would characterise Mr Chew\u2019s testimony \u201cas a \u2018mini disaster\u2019 for this key moment for TikTok. TikTok is now poster child of the US/China tensions and lawmakers have a lot of q\u2019s with not enough concrete answers\u201d.\n\u2018Save our children\u2019\nDemocratic lawmaker Tony Cardenas said Mr Chew was a \u201cgood dancer with words\u201d and accused him of avoiding tough questions on evidence that the app has harmed children\u2019s mental health.\nMr Chew said the company was investing in content moderation and artificial intelligence to limit such content.\nRepresentative Diana DeGette, a Democrat, said TikTok\u2019s efforts to prevent the spread of misinformation on the platform were not working.\n\u201cYou gave me only generalised statements that you\u2019re investing, that you\u2019re concerned, that you\u2019re doing work. That\u2019s not enough for me. That\u2019s not enough for the parents of America,\u201d Ms DeGette said.\nRepresentative Gus Bilirakis showed the committee a collection of short TikTok videos that appeared to glorify self-harm and suicide, or outright tell viewers to kill themselves.\n\u201cYour technology is literally leading to death,\u201d Mr Bilirakis said. \u201cWe must save our children from big tech companies like yours, who continue to abuse and manipulate them for your own gain.\u201d\nMr Chew told Mr Bilirakis that TikTok takes the issue of suicide and self-harm \u201cvery, very seriously\u201d.
