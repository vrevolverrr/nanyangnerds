We have a mandate, and we will complete it,\u201d Ms Machado told a press conference in Caracas.\nThe ruling was \u201cjudicial crime\u201d, she said, adding there will be many obstacles still to overcome, but there will be elections in 2024.\nMr Jorge Rodriguez, a lawmaker who heads Mr Maduro\u2019s team in negotiations with the opposition, said prior to the Treasury decision that if Washington took \u201cany aggressive action\u201d, Venezuela\u2019s response would be \u201cserene, reciprocal and energetic\u201d.\nMr Maduro repeated the same rhetoric during his weekly television show on the evening of Jan 29, without commenting directly on the Minerven decision.
