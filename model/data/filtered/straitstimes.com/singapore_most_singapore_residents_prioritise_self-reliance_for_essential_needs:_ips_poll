Singaporeans hold self-reliance in high regard. This includes the lower-income themselves, who find dignity in providing for themselves and their families,\u201d he said.\nThe poll found that while more than four in five surveyed felt that public schemes to help low-income individuals should be more generous, more than two-thirds also agreed that the support available today is eroding recipients\u2019 self-reliance.\n\u201cTaken together, this may suggest that while there is a desire for more generous government support for low-income individuals, there are lingering concerns that such support should not reduce recipients\u2019 self-reliance,\u201d said the survey report.\nThere were generational differences in perspectives, with younger respondents leaning more towards the Government providing for both basic needs and items for a decent standard of living. Older respondents favoured self-provision for items for a decent standard of living.\nIPS principal research fellow and head of its Social Lab Mathew Mathews said younger respondents might be looking at models in different countries where there are more public support schemes.\n\u201cHowever, they may not be cognisant of the fact that other societies have other kinds of demands, such as higher taxation,\u201d he said at a media briefing on July 10.\nProfessor Paulin Straughan, who spearheaded the SMU study, said more opportunities should be created for youth here to volunteer, to show that they can make a difference.\n\u201cIt\u2019s when you can\u2019t see where you can contribute, then you may begin to say the Government (should provide),\u201d said the director of SMU\u2019s Centre for Research on Successful Ageing.\nReallocation of public funds preferred over higher taxes\nClose to 60 per cent of respondents who felt that the Government should provide some of the 39 items said that funding for these essential needs should come from reallocated public funds, as opposed to higher taxes.\nThere was no clear consensus on where this funding should be reallocated from, though the areas that drew the highest responses were the arts and culture (36.8 per cent), sports (32.7 per cent), and heritage conservation (27.3 per cent).\nImplicit in the findings was the public\u2019s understanding that social assistance must be reasonable and sustainable, bearing in mind that it is funded by taxpayers, said Mr Masagos.\nMr Masagos said that while there is a preference for reallocating government spending from other areas, this involves hard choices.\n\u201cThis is a delicate balance we will need to strike \u2013 between which items to provide for through government funding, and the trade-offs we need to make as a society,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the studies show there is much room for others besides the state \u2013 such as individuals, organisations, and businesses \u2013 to support vulnerable families in achieving stability, self-reliance and social mobility.\nAgreeing, Prof Straughan said a whole-of-society approach is needed as the Government can only do so much, beyond which taxes may have to be raised.\nFor instance, the desire for travel to South-east Asian countries once a year can be met by community clubs, which may currently be more focused on organising several local outings annually.\nThey can also open up air-conditioned rooms on their premises for community use on hot days, she suggested.\nShe also called for more philanthropy, now that the studies have made visible the gaps where people feel help is essential.\n\u201cBusinesses that are doing well and top income earners here can do their part to bring the community together and make Singapore a stronger and more stable nation,\u201d she said."}
