You know, Yana, the worst feeling is when you are in shock and there is no one to speak to. You are lost in your thoughts all alone.\u201d\nShe added that he said this while holding a piece of paper that recorded the board\u2019s decision on Feb 2 to halve his corruption jail term from 12 years to six.\nNajib is set to be released on Aug 23, 2028, if he pays his fine, also reduced to RM50 million (S$14 million) from RM210 million.\nHis party Umno said on Feb 3 that it respects the Pardons Board\u2019s decision but will continue to fight until Najib is released from prison.\nMs Nooryana, who is also a committee member of Umno\u2019s women\u2019s wing, said her father had been very hopeful about the outcome of the Pardons Board\u2019s decision five days before the announcement of its conclusion.\nShe said that before the decision was announced, those around Najib had encouraged him to be patient as \u201cit won\u2019t be long\u201d. She added that the disappointment felt by Najib may have been because he did not get a full pardon, and because he may have to spend the next four to five years in jail.\n\u201cHis eyes looked tired. Maybe Daddy lacks sleep, pondering the decision which was made yesterday,\u201d she added in her Instagram post. THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK"}
