It began last November when the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intercepted the vessel.\nWestern Australian police substituted the cargo with identically packed fake cocaine and dropped it roughly 40 nautical miles (74km) west of state capital Perth on Dec 28.\nThree suspected members of the \u201cAustralian arm of a drug syndicate\u201d with 1.2 tonnes of fake cocaine were arrested on Dec 30, after allegedly making three trips out through rough seas to collect the packages.\nA further nine arrests were made through Jan 13, including a traffic stop on the Great Eastern Highway, roughly 600km east of the state capital Perth, where officers found more than A$2 million in cash.\nHailing the success of \u201cOperation Beech\u201d, Western Australia police commissioner Col Blanch said in a statement: \u201cThe operation sends a message to international drug traffickers \u2013 your deadly drugs are not welcome here.\u201d\nA 39-year-old male US citizen was among the 12 charged, police said.
