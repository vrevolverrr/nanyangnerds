It expects SIA to post core net profit of $2.5 billion at end-March 2024, boosted by low jet fuel prices, which it reiterated \u201cwill likely peak this year\u201d. Core net profit in 2022 was $1.9 billion.\nMr Yap also forecast SIA paying out a dividend per share of 38 cents for the current financial year, up from a dividend per share of 28 cents it paid for the last financial year."}
