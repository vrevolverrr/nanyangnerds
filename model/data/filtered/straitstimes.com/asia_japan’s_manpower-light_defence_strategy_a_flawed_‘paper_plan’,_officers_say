But I kept telling them that I wanted to join. Now, they are supporting me,\u201d Mr Yoshito Yamaguchi, a 21-year-old student, told Reuters at a recruitment event in December at an airbase near Tokyo.\nHe was one of only 11 people who attended the event.\nBy 2028, when Japan is expected to have completed its military expansion, the number of 18- to 26-year-olds in the country will shrink by 800,000 to 10 million, according to the government.\nRetired major-general Nozomu Yoshitomi, now a professor at Tokyo\u2019s Nihon University, said staffing issues may occur in new areas such as cyber warfare, where the government will have to match the high pay offered in private-sector jobs to find talent.\nMr Grant Newsham, a retired US Marine Corps colonel and research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies who served as a USMC liaison officer to the SDF, said: \u201cIf the Japanese think automation\u2026 is going to make up for the personnel disaster they\u2019ve got, they can forget about it.\u201d REUTERS"}
