It is also referred to as an e-cigarette, e-vaporiser or electronic nicotine delivery system.\nThe liquid is referred to as an e-liquid or juice.\nVapes usually consist of a cartridge that holds the e-liquid, a heating coil also known as an atomiser, sensors that detect when the user inhales and turns the device on, and a battery.\nVape cartridges are sometimes replaceable, and are also referred to as pods.\nQ: What chemicals are commonly found in vapes?\nA: The e-liquid in vapes usually contains nicotine, flavouring and vitamin E acetate. Nicotine is an addictive substance and is also found in traditional cigarettes.\nThe flavouring, which is not vetted by the health authorities here, can sometimes release cancer-causing agents such as formaldehyde and benzene when heated.\nVitamin E, in and of itself, is not harmful. But vitamin E acetate, which is used as an additive in e-liquids, can cling to lung tissue when inhaled. Its full effect is still being studied.\nHeavy metal particles such as tin, lead and nickel have been found in vapes, and are believed to be a result of the heating mechanism. When inhaled, these can cause respiratory diseases, according to the HealthHub website.\nSome vape liquids also contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), which are derived from the cannabis plant.\nTHC is the main psychoactive substance in cannabis that causes users to feel \u201chigh\u201d, and is listed as a Class A controlled drug in Singapore. CBD is a core chemical compound found in the cannabis plant. It does not cause the same \u201chigh\u201d as THC, and can be found in a limited number of pharmaceutical products.\nQ: Why are vapes still in use in Singapore?\nA: A disposable vaporiser costs about $30 and can last for roughly 5,000 puffs. Non-disposable vaporisers may cost about $60, and a set of three pods \u2013 each lasting for about 500 puffs \u2013 costs $17.\nIn comparison, a packet of 20 premium cigarettes costs about $14.\nVape products are being sold via social messaging platforms like Telegram. From 2018 to 2022, 860 people were caught selling and smuggling vaporisers.\nQ: How does vaping affect children and youth?\nA: Nicotine is harmful to developing brains, but even without nicotine, inhaling the mist can damage your lungs, said lung surgeon Aneez Ahmed.\nHe explained that vaping mist contains particulate matter, which can trigger inflammation and cause blood vessels in the lungs to close up.\nDr Aneez previously operated on two vapers, aged 19 and 21, who suffered from pneumothorax, or collapsed lungs. He said vaping delayed their recovery.\nMedical experts have also warned that the cancerous effects of inhaling the other chemicals when vaping may not be apparent until the vaper is older.\nThe Ministry of Education said that over the past three years, an average of about seven out of every 1,000 students from primary schools, secondary schools and pre-university institutions were caught for smoking and vaping offences. But vaping appears to be popular with young people, with reports of even primary school pupils getting caught.\nIn January, a man was nabbed by HSA for selling vapes to students at West Mall."}
