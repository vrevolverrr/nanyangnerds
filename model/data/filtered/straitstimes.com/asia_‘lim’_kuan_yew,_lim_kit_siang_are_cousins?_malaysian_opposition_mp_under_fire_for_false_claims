Malaysian opposition MP under fire for false claims", "tags": "asia", "timestamp": "2023-11-08", "content": "Malaysian opposition MP Siti Mastura Muhammad is under fire for telling an audience that former Democratic Action Party (DAP) leader Lim Kit Siang is a cousin of Singapore\u2019s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and former Malayan Communist Party leader Chin Peng.\nThe Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) MP made the claims while speaking at a by-election rally in Kemaman, Terengganu, last week. A video of her speech has been widely shared on social media.\n\u201cLim Kuan Yew, Lim Kit Siang, Chin Peng, cousins. Can you see the link?\u201d Dr Siti asked her audience. \u201cLim Kuan Yew lives in Singapore today. What he did in Singapore, we see the model happening in Malaysia.\u201d\nDr Siti referred to the late Mr Lee as \u201cLim\u201d Kuan Yew more than once in the video.\nShe also claimed that Mr Lim Kit Siang\u2019s son, former finance minister Lim Guan Eng, is related to other DAP leaders, including Mr Anthony Loke, Ms Teresa Kok, Mr Nga Kor Ming and Mr Ngeh Koo Ham.\nHer claim has prompted a sharp rebuke from the younger Lim, who is chairman of the DAP.\n\u201cThis is not just a personal attack but has racial undertones as well. It is a spiteful allegation against my father, Tan Sri Lim Kit Siang, and me,\u201d Lim said during a press conference at Parliament on Tuesday.\nHe stressed that he and his wife have no family ties with the four DAP leaders.\n\u201cWhat is most important is that there is no family relation with Chin Peng and Lee Kuan Yew,\u201d he said. \u201cLee Kuan Yew has passed away, and is not alive like she mentioned.\u201d\nLim added that their surnames are different and that any Malaysians who believe Dr Siti\u2019s claims are simply \u201cfrogs in a well\u201d.\nHe said he will give the Kepala Batas MP a chance to substantiate her claim with evidence by Thursday.\n\u201cIf she fails to provide evidence, I will take further action,\u201d he added.\nWhen Dr Siti was speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, numerous MPs attempted to interrupt her speech and asked her to explain her claims. She ignored them.\nShe also dodged reporters\u2019 questions about Lim\u2019s demand for evidence on Tuesday, and urged them to \u201cwatch the video until the end\u201d instead.\nLim said his father has remained a target of PAS leaders\u2019 attacks even after retiring from politics.\n\u201cThis is another example of PAS\u2019 politics of extremism and slander,\u201d he said. \u201cEven they know their claims are unfounded.\u201d\nPAS leaders and delegates have over the years repeatedly linked the Chinese-dominated DAP to communism. They have also likened DAP to Singapore\u2019s People\u2019s Action Party, saying that DAP, which is part of the ruling Pakatan Harapan coalition, could pose a threat to the special rights of Malay Muslims.\nMalaysia\u2019s Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching on Tuesday advised leaders of the opposition bloc against stirring up racial sentiments.\n\u201cThe opposing side uses this rhetoric continually to tarnish the image of DAP leaders,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe spread of such slander can divide the unity of Malaysia\u2019s ethnic groups.\u201d"}
