Action leads to accountability,\u201d the statement read.\nIt added that all of its branches in Taiwan have since undergone additional cleaning and disinfection of tableware.\nThe student also faces punishment from her school.\nYuan Ze University said on June 24 that it will discipline the student according to its school rules and have her apologise, according to TYE News.\nIt said: \u201cYuan Ze University... attaches great importance to students\u2019 moral education and health and safety education.\n\u201cIf it receives news reports or complaints from the public, it will handle them prudently and in accordance with the principles of fairness and impartiality.\u201d\nIn February, an Osaka man landed in prison for his unhygienic prank at a Yoshinoya outlet to amuse his online fans. He had eaten directly with his used chopsticks from a common-use container at the restaurant.\nIn 2023, a sushi restaurant chain sued a customer for 67 million yen (S$568,000), saying a viral online video of the teenager licking communal bottles and plates caused a drop in sales, foot traffic and the company\u2019s shares."}
