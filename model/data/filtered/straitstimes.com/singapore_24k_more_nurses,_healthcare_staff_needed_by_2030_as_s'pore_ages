Our seniors also prefer to age in a familiar environment. We should not lose this,\" said Mr Ong.\n\"As a society, we must guard against the assumption that seniors will always become sick and frail, and unable to take care of themselves.\"\nAn estimated 97 per cent of seniors above 65 can either live independently or with some help in the community today.\nMr Ong also alluded to research showing that the health impact of loneliness for a senior is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\n\"We must maintain or improve that share, and not inadvertently give them that equivalent of 15 cigarettes a day, and weaken their health and ability to live independently,\" he said.\nBut he also pointed out that an expanding aged population needs more healthcare. And since there simply are not enough local nurses available for this, Singapore will have to rely on more foreign nurses.\nReplying to several MPs, including Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang) and Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang), who had raised issues on manpower, Mr Ong said there has been no exodus of local nurses, and that efforts are afoot to raise the intake of nursing students locally to 2,300, from 2,100 currently.\nWhile locals will continue to form the bulk of the nursing workforce, the number and role of foreign nurses will grow.\n\"If we want to take care of our seniors and the sick, if we want to reduce the workload of healthcare workers, we must expect foreign healthcare workers to play a bigger role in the coming years,\" said Mr Ong.\n\"This is especially so in areas that are facing a bigger manpower crunch, like aged care or palliative care.\"\nIn response to Nominated MP and breast surgeon Tan Yia Swam's suggestion of granting permanent residency to the good performers, given the heightened international competition for nurses, Mr Ong said MOH is supportive of this.\nThe Immigration and Checkpoints Authority assesses permanent residency applications holistically and will certainly consider the important contributions of healthcare workers, and MOH's support for foreign healthcare workers, when evaluating their applications, he said.\nSingaporeans and permanent residents make up about 72 per cent of Singapore's pool of registered nurses and 63 per cent of enrolled nurses. The rest are from the Philippines, Malaysia. China, India, Myanmar and other countries.\nMr Ong said MOH will broaden training for existing nurses, allied health professionals and pharmacists so that they can take on crucial roles alongside doctors.\nFor example, community nurses will be trained in lifestyle coaching to help residents make good choices according to their care needs, he said.\nThere are also plans to train community pharmacists, who can already provide smoking cessation and weight management services, in influenza vaccination.\n\"But first, there must be enough people to train,\" he said,\nMeanwhile, Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Health, in his reply to Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong) and Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang), said Singapore is trying to grow its pool of family physicians to meet its target of 3,500 by 2030.\nOverall, about 200 overseas-trained Singaporean doctors come back every year, he added."}
