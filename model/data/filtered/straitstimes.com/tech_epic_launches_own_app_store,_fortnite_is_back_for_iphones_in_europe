In January the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case, effectively ending the legal saga.\nApple has justified the fees as helping ensure dangerous apps are weeded out and the operating system is secure.\n\u2018Friction\u2019\nEpic is the first major video game publisher to open its own app store for Android and Apple devices.\nIn order to attract app developers to its store, Epic is offering them better revenue-sharing terms than Apple or Google.\nBut Epic said Apple wasn\u2019t making it easy, with a long and untransparent procedure to install their app store and disadvantageous conditions for developers to cooperate with them.\nWhen announcing last week that it would comply with the new EU regulations Apple said it would implement a new fee structure for developers who send customers out of an app for offers and content.\nEpic has set a goal of 100 million installs of its app store on Android and iOS devices by the end of the year.\n\u201cThe only thing standing in our way is going to be the friction that Apple and Google put in front of us, and it\u2019s pretty significant,\u201d said Mr Steve Allison, head of the Epic Games Store.\nIn addition to Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe is also available on the store, as is Fall Guys, which is making its first appearance on mobile.\n\u201cThis is just the beginning of a long effort to bring our games back to all these platforms worldwide, and the fight\u2019s not over until Fortnite is back on iOS everywhere and free of Apple\u2019s taxes,\u201d said Sweeney.
