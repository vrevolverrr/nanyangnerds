Moscow had a contract with Iran for a total of 1,750, Gen Skibitsky said, adding that a new batch of perhaps as many as 300 drones was now arriving as part of that contract.\nAmerican officials have said that they are aware of reports that Russia and Iran are trying to set up a joint production facility for drones in Russia.\nRussia\u2019s goal is to use swarms of drones in such large numbers that they overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defences, allowing some to get through to their targets, Gen Skibitsky said.\nIn the recent attacks, he added, so many drones were fired that Ukraine\u2019s National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems \u2013 advanced air defence systems produced by the United States and Norway \u2013 had to be reloaded with missiles while the raids were ongoing, the first time that has happened in the war.\n\u201cIf there are a very large number of drones in a particular direction, then they can simply break through the air defence system in that area,\u201d he said.
