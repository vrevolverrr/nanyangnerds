Their total wealth was US$3.5 trillion (S$4.9 trillion), down 18 per cent.\nMeanwhile, the number of individuals with US$10 billion fell by 29 to 56, and the number of dollar billionaires dropped by 239 to 946 this year.\n\u201cThis year has seen the biggest fall in the Hurun China Rich List of the last 24 years,\u201d said Mr Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of research firm Hurun Report, which compiles the list.\nThe global economic outlook has this year been heavily impacted by the war in Ukraine and slowing economic growth in China that has in turn been exacerbated by the country\u2019s ultra-strict Covid-19 policies and a prolonged property slump.\nA two-year regulatory crackdown that has hit China\u2019s biggest tech names such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, and concerns that President Xi Jinping will sacrifice growth for ideology in his third term, have also weighed on investor confidence, with Hong Kong and mainland stock markets tumbling in recent weeks.\nMs Yang Huiyan, the woman behind Country Garden Holdings, which like many other Chinese developers has been battling debt issues, saw her wealth fall by US$15.7 billion, the biggest drop on the 2022 list.\nMr Zhong Shanshan, whose listed companies are water bottler Nongfu Spring and vaccine developer Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, took first place on the list for the second year running, with a fortune that grew 17 per cent to US$65 billion.\nThe founder of TikTok owner ByteDance, Mr Zhang Yiming, came in second, but saw his wealth fall 28 per cent to US$35 billion due to a drop in ByteDance\u2019s valuation. In third place was Mr Zeng Yuqun, chairman of battery giant CATL.\nTencent founder Pony Ma posted the second-largest drop in wealth of US$14.6 billion amid sliding tech stock prices to take fifth place on the list.\nAlibaba founder Jack Ma and his family tumbled four places to be ranked No. 9.
