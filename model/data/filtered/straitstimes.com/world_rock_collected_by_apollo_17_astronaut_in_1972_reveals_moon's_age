This blasted magma - molten rock - into space, forming a debris disk that orbited Earth and coalesced into the Moon. But the exact timing of the Moon's formation has been hard to nail down.\nMineral crystals were able to form after the magma cooled and solidified. The researchers used a method called atom probe tomography to confirm the age of the oldest-known solids that formed after the giant impact, the zircon crystals inside the fragment of a type of rock called norite collected by Schmitt.\n\"I love the fact that this study was done on a sample that was collected and brought to Earth 51 years ago. At that time, atom probe tomography wasn't developed yet and scientists wouldn't have imagined the types of analyses we do today,\" said cosmochemist Philipp Heck, senior director of research at the Field Museum in Chicago, a University of Chicago professor and senior author of the study published in the journal Geochemical Perspectives Letters.\n\"Interestingly, all the oldest minerals found on Earth, Mars and the Moon are zircon crystals. Zircon, not diamond, lasts forever,\" UCLA planetary scientist and study co-author Bidong Zhang added.\nThe rock containing the zircon was collected in the Taurus-Littrow valley at the southeastern edge of the lunar Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity) and stored at Nasa's Johnson Space Centre in Houston.\n\"Zircons are very hard and tough and survive the breakdown of rocks during weathering,\" Prof Heck said.\nA study led by Mr Zhang published in 2021 used a technique called ion microprobe analysis to measure how many atoms of uranium and lead were in the crystals, calculating the age of the zircon based on the decay of radioactive uranium to lead over time.\nThat age needed to be confirmed through another method because of a potential complication involving lead atoms if defects existed in the zircon crystal structure.\nThe new study used atom probe tomography to determine there were no complications involving the lead atoms, confirming the age of the crystals.\n\"I see this as a great example of what the nanoscale, or even atomic scale, can tell us about big-picture questions,\" said study lead author Jennika Greer, a cosmochemist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland."}
