This will take place just before he visits a group of elderly and sick people at St Theresa\u2019s Home, a Catholic welfare nursing home in Upper Thomson.\nCardinal Goh expressed his hope that the pontiff will inspire his audience to be more zealous and in line with his vision and mission, and also for them to encounter Christ through him.\n\u201cWe learn after him to be good shepherds,\u201d he added.\nOn how the Pope\u2019s visit might impact the wider Singapore society, Cardinal Goh said: \u201cI think the Holy Father has come to bring the people closer together.\u201d\nThe pontiff\u2019s messages have always been for \u201call of humanity\u201d, Cardinal Goh added, noting that he expects themes of interreligious harmony, respect for others, and care for the poor, suffering and marginalised to define the visit.\nAs for the faithful, Cardinal Goh said the Pope has come to be their shepherd, and that the Pope knows the realities in Singapore.\n\u201cHe knows, but coming here is to see the realities, that is even more important.\u201d\nThe head of the world\u2019s Catholics had arrived in Singapore a day earlier, to a welcome party that included about 1,000 Catholics who had a hand in organising his visit.\nLining the Jurassic Mile along Airport Boulevard, they chanted \u201cViva, viva, Papa Francesco\u201d, or \u201cLong live, Pope Francis\u201d in Italian, as he cruised down in a buggy.\nHe was then whisked off for his private programme, which included a meeting with members of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, a Roman Catholic religious order, at the St Francis Xavier Retreat Centre in Punggol.\nThe last time a pope visited Singapore was in 1986, when the late Pope John Paul II made a brief stopover for five hours during a tour of the region that included stops in Bangladesh, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and the Seychelles."}
