The US is obligated by its Taiwan Relations Act to provide the island with the arms it needs to defend itself.\nUS officials\u2019 visits and arms sales to Taiwan have angered China, which views such acts as providing tacit support for Taiwan independence.\nDuring the question-and-answer session that followed his speech, Adm Dong dwelled on Taiwan for 10 minutes, even as delegates asked questions on other matters, including China\u2019s position on Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\u201cTaiwan is the core of China\u2019s core interests; since I\u2019m asked about it, I have to answer it responsibly,\u201d he explained to the moderator, Dr Bastian Giegerich, chief executive of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), who interrupted him twice to nudge him to address other questions.\nOn the broader regional security concerns, he said: \u201cWe countries in the Asia-Pacific have the ability and confidence to resolve issues in our region. Our people hate to take orders from hegemonic powers or be sucked into confrontational camps.\u201d\nHe also said: \u201cWe do not allow hegemony politics to harm Asia-Pacific. We do not allow others to bring their geopolitical conflict and cold and hot wars into Asia-Pacific. We do not allow any country, any force to start wars and create chaos here.\u201d\nAlthough he did not name any country, it was an obvious allusion to the US. The Joe Biden administration has adopted a strategy of enlisting its allies and partners so that it can speak to China from a \u201cposition of strength\u201d.\nSpeaking at the same forum a day earlier, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin had stressed that the Indo-Pacific remains a priority and encouraged like-minded countries in the region to \u201cconverge\u201d on security matters. \u201cThe United States can be secure only if Asia is,\u201d he said.\nAnalysts say this differing view is partly why both countries are on a path of collision.\nAssociate Professor Alfred Wu at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy pointed out to The Straits Times that while China views the US as an \u201cexternal force\u201d, the US sees itself as part of the Asia-Pacific community as it is next to the Pacific Ocean and has many interests intertwined with Asia.\n\u201cAs China sees the risks over Taiwan and South China Sea rising and blames the US for fanning the flame, it will become more entrenched on a path of collision with the US,\u201d he said.\nAdm Dong on June 2 also spoke on the South China Sea, taking aim at a \u201ccertain country\u201d that allowed the US to deploy an intermediate-range missile system. It was a pointed response to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who on May 31 asserted his nation\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea that are disputed by China.\nThe Chinese Coast Guard had in recent months used water cannon to hit at Philippine military vessels near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, causing a few injuries. President Marcos said that if one Philippine national were to die in such conflict, he would consider it as close to an act of war.\nThe US has a mutual defence treaty with the Philippines and is obliged to go to its defence if the latter comes under attack.\nMr Austin had said on June 1: \u201cThe harassment that the Philippines has faced is dangerous \u2013 plain and simple.\u201d\nAdm Dong turned that comment on its head, likening the Philippines\u2019 action to \u201cpeng ci\u2019er\u201d, a Chinese colloquial term to describe fraudsters who intentionally get themselves injured, so as to claim compensation.\n\u201cYou let yourself be bumped into a car, you fall and create an impression that you are hurt, you are vulnerable. When in actual fact you violated laws and regulations, had made a premeditated move and were distorting the facts and creating trouble,\u201d he said.\n\u201cChina has exercised sufficient restraint, but there is a limit,\u201d Adm Dong warned."}
