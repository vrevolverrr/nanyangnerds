The company occupies a leading position in China\u2019s premium smartphone market, in part due to the decimation of Huawei Technologies\u2019 smartphone business by US export controls, but has also come under scrutiny in the run-up to the iPhone 15\u2019s launch.\nShares in Apple and its suppliers were battered last week after reports that Chinese government agencies and state firms were banning staff from using the phone, and Huawei launched a new smartphone with an advanced chip, seen as an effort by the Chinese firm for a comeback.\nThe unveiling of Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 attracted intense discussion online on Wednesday, as new models have done in the past. The new phone goes on sale online in China on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall marketplace on Sept 15, and in-stores on Sept 22.\nTopics discussing the new launch attracted 380 million views on social media platform Weibo, with more than 800,000 discussions, including posts, comments and likes, on the iPhone 15.\nMany cheered the iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s new 3-nanometre chip and Apple\u2019s pitch that console-quality games, such as Resident Evil 4 Remake, could be played on the device, appealing to China\u2019s army of mobile gamers.\nBut several social media users had misgivings about choosing an American brand over a domestically made rival, especially after state media applauded the roll-out of Huawei\u2019s Mate 60 Pro earlier in September as a triumph by China over US sanctions.\nA survey by Chinese news portal Sina on the social media platform asking participants if they would buy the Mate 60 or iPhone 15 saw 61,000 votes for the Huawei device versus 24,000 for the iPhone 15.\nComparisons of how the Mate 60 Pro could make calls and send texts via satellite, while the iPhone 15 was only capable of satellite texts, also generated significant discussion.\n\u201cThe iPhone 15 can only send SOS messages via satellite, using last-generation technology already deployed in Huawei\u2019s Mate 60, which supports full satellite calling,\u201d one user wrote.\nChina\u2019s smartphone market, like the sector globally, is in the midst of a slump and analysts cautioned that this, and the country\u2019s slowing economy, could also weigh on sales of the iPhone 15.\nApple\u2019s third-party retailers in February launched rare discounts on the iPhone 14 Pro by as much as 10 per cent that helped sales but could undermine demand for the latest series, analysts said.\n\u201cThis is not a good signal for the upcoming 15 series as some demand has been fulfilled before the launch,\u201d said Mr Archie Zhang, a research analyst at Counterpoint. \u201cBefore Huawei\u2019s surprise launch, we projected Apple\u2019s sales in China in the third and fourth quarter to be flat or slightly weaker than last year.\u201d\nMr Will Wong, an analyst with industry research group IDC, saw recent public sector developments and Huawei posing a challenge for Apple.\n\u201cSales (of the iPhone 15) are not going to be easy, especially since Chinese consumers are either being cautious in spending or have shifted their focus to leisure or travel,\u201d he added.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Beijing has not issued a ban on the purchase and use of foreign phone brands like Apple but noted that it has noticed media coverage of security incidents related to Apple\u2019s phones.\nIDC expects Apple\u2019s share in China\u2019s premium phone market will gradually decline due to increased competition from Huawei.\nFor the first half of 2023, Apple held a 67 per cent market share for phones priced over US$600 (S$820), followed by Huawei with 15.6 per cent.
