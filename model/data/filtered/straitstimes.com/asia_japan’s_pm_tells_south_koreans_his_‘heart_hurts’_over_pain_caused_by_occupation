Koreans accuse Japan of forcing women to work in wartime brothels for the Japanese military and using forced labour, among other abuses.\nAfter South Korean courts ordered Japanese companies to pay compensation in the forced labour cases in 2018, Japan restricted exports of high-tech material to South Korea, and Seoul threatened to pull out of a military intelligence-sharing deal with Tokyo.\nMr Yoon is facing criticism at home that he has given more than he has received in his efforts to improve ties with Japan, including by proposing that South Korean businesses \u2013 not the Japanese companies as ordered by a court \u2013 compensate victims of wartime labour. Polls show many South Koreans do not believe Japan has done enough to atone and apologise.\nMr Yoon has signalled that he does not believe Japan needs to \u201ckneel\u201d any more over what happened in the past, but South Korean officials were hoping that Mr Kishida would make a gesture.\n\u201cI was moved by the many people who opened their hearts for the future without forgetting the painful memories of the past,\u201d Mr Kishida said of Mr Yoon\u2019s proposal.\nOn Sunday, small gatherings of about 50 people demonstrated in opposition to, and support of, Mr Kishida\u2019s visit, but his presence did not spark widespread protests.\nDespite the lack of a new apology, Mr Kishida\u2019s reaffirmation of reconciliation and the summit symbolism has value for the countries\u2019 relations, said Dr Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.\n\u201cPublics will be reassured that Korean and Japanese flags fly side by side, national anthems play together, and leaders host each other at friendly dinners with their spouses,\u201d he said.\nSecurity, economic cooperation\nThe focus of the summit between the two US allies revolved around security cooperation in the face of North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats, with a particular eye on American interests in the region, said Dr Shin-wha Lee, a professor of international relations at Seoul-based Korea University.\n\u201cTheir military and economic capabilities are crucial for promoting multilateral regional security cooperation, and a poor relationship between the two countries could obstruct US objectives,\u201d she said.\nMr Kishida said they discussed bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues such as North Korea. He said he had agreed to allow South Korean experts to inspect the planned release of water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, which has been controversial with Japan\u2019s neighbours concerned about possible environmental effects.\nHe has invited Mr Yoon to the Group-of-Seven summit set for later this month in Japan and for trilateral talks with the US on the sidelines.\nWhile Mr Yoon and Mr Kishida did not mention points of friction with China at their joint press conference, they did speak about shared values for human rights, rule of law, and a free and open Indo-Pacific, Dr Easley said.\n\u201cThis suggests that Seoul and Tokyo are increasingly on the same page about strengthening supply chain security, resisting economic coercion, and deterring unilateral uses of force in Asia,\u201d he said.
