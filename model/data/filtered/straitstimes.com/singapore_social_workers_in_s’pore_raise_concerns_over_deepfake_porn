And the more one pays, the more explicit the generated images can get.\n\u201cDeepfakes are a genre of pornography that we are seeing more among addicts,\u201d said We Care Community Services\u2019 counsellor Alvin Seng, who specialises in therapy for those with sex- and porn-related addiction.\nThe addiction recovery centre has not dealt with victims of deepfakes here as the trend is still new, but the issue has cropped up in an increasing number of talks with school partners, said Mr Seng.\n\u201cBut it is still early and could be happening right now. I\u2019d imagine that cases are coming soon,\u201d he told ST.\nMr Seng said deepfakes should not be viewed lightly, no matter how unrealistic the renders seem.\n\u201cTo a victim, seeing their face on a deepfake will feel very personal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a violation of privacy and a betrayal of their trust.\u201d\nOne of the earliest cases of deepfake sexploitation reported here occurred in June, when at least four men were blackmailed by fraudsters with deepfakes using their faces.\nOne of the victims received an explicit video of himself from an unknown contact, who threatened to circulate it unless he paid $700.\nIt is not known how many more cases like that have occurred in Singapore. The police said then that they do not track the number of deepfake-related scams.\nThe deepfake threat has prompted counsellors at non-profit Touch Cyber Wellness to develop a module for parents and young people to address emerging online dangers, including image-based sexual abuse and cyber bullying, according to manager Shem Yao.\nSet to launch in 2025, the module will educate young people on the impact of deepfakes, as well as how to spot them and respond if they encounter them.\nDeepfakes should not be ignored just because they are fake, said Mr Yao.\n\u201cVictims often endure profound emotional distress, feeling ashamed and powerless over their own image,\u201d he said. \u201cThis violation can lead to significant stress and lasting harm to their reputation.\u201d\nWith time, deepfake images are sure to become even more realistic, he added.\nSingapore has seen a number of cases involving online sexual harassment.\nNotably, more than 44,000 Telegram users were part of a chat group formed in 2018 \u2013 SG Nasi Lemak \u2013 where lewd images of young girls and revenge pornography were circulated. It was shut down in 2019.\nImage-based sexual abuse is among the most common types of online harms faced by clients of SheCares@SCWO, a support centre for victims of online harms, said assistant director of research Natalie Chia from SG Her Empowerment, which runs the centre.\nA study by the non-profit organisation in 2023 found that nearly a tenth of internet users have personally experienced image-based sexual abuse, including deepfakes. Women were almost twice as likely to be sexually harassed online than men.\nAdvocates and experts have long called for new policies that will help online harassment victims seek redress swiftly.\nThis was echoed by Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam, who said in 2023 that the law needs to be expanded to enable victims of harmful online content to take action and protect themselves.\nSince then, the authorities have allocated $50 million for a new Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety which will research tools to detect harmful online content, including misinformation and deepfakes.\nNew measures to counter deepfakes of candidates during elections were also announced on Sept 11.\nMore can be done in Singapore to protect those who have limited options to seek redress, as online harassers are usually anonymous, said Cyber Youth Singapore president and chief executive Ben Chua.\nThe charity conducts cyber-wellness workshops and is revamping its course material to raise awareness of deepfakes.\nTech companies can be slow to remove content too, said Mr Chua.\nMessaging app Telegram, for instance, has been slammed for its lack of cooperation with the authorities worldwide, leading to the arrest of its founder Pavel Durov in August over allegedly allowing criminal activity on the platform, including drug trafficking and child sexual abuse images.\nDurov\u2019s arrest reflects an increase in pressure to hold platforms responsible for not complying with the authorities in the fight against online harms, said Ms Chia, who called for stronger regulations to make it illegal to create, possess and share image-based sexual abuse materials.\nCyber-security expert Abhishek Singh of Check Point Software Technologies said Telegram is an ideal platform for vices to thrive.\nThis is because it allows large files to be shared across massive groups of up to 200,000 members, who can choose not to disclose their phone numbers to remain anonymous.\n\u201cIt has brought dark web content to the masses on a public channel,\u201d he added.\nDeepfake software, in particular, has become more widely available since late 2023, said senior threat researcher David Sancho from cyber-security firm Trend Micro.\nHe said: \u201cAny teenager can (use these apps). It\u2019s not expensive and there are even support forums to guide users on how to do it.\u201d\nMr Sancho added: \u201cThe trouble is, if you close one platform, another pops up.\u201d\nAdvice to guard against deepfakes\nAvoid allowing unfamiliar accounts to follow your social media accounts, and be mindful of the content that you post, although this can be hard to control in this day and age, said Mr Seng.\nVictims of deepfake porn should make a police report and flag the content to the online platform, said Mr Yao.\nThey should collect evidence, including images of the online material, time and date, and the usernames of those who have shared it. Mr Yao said: \u201cEvidence is vital, even if the specifics are painful to recall.\u201d"}
