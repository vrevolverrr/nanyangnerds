Since then, the European Union and other G-7 countries have debated how and whether to use the funds to help Ukraine.\nUS proposals to use them to directly fund Ukraine in the war would have \u201cquite serious legal implications\u201d, which still need clarifying, said Mr Giorgetti, who will host the Stresa meeting as Italy holds the rotating presidency of the G-7.\nThe US has proposed seizing the assets in their entirety, but Europe has baulked, citing risks to the euro and massive legal repercussions.\nMore recently, Washington has pushed for using the assets as collateral to provide loans for Ukraine.
