The law has been described as discriminatory by Malaysia, the world\u2019s second-largest producer of palm oil after Indonesia.\nPlantations and Commodities Minister Johari Abdul Ghani said Malaysia would offer gifts of orang utans to trading partners, particularly major importers such as the EU, India and China, as part of a diplomatic strategy.\n\u201cThis will prove to the global community that Malaysia is committed to biodiversity conservation,\u201d Mr Johari said on social media platform X late on May 7.\n\u201cMalaysia cannot take a defensive approach to the issue of palm oil. Instead we need to show the countries of the world that Malaysia is a sustainable oil palm producer and is committed to protecting forests and environmental sustainability.\u201d\nNo further details of the plan were immediately available.\nThe orang utan, whose name means \u201cman of the forest\u201d in Malay, is critically endangered, with a population of less than 105,000 on the island of Borneo, conservation group WWF says.\nWWF Malaysia said palm oil estates should set aside wildlife corridors that are safe for orang utans, and it called on the government to stop the further conversion of forests into plantations.\nIt also raised concerns over how the orang utan plan could affect efforts to protect and conserve existing ape populations.\n\u201cWWF supports in-situ conservation of wildlife, and would urge that trading partners are brought to Malaysia to support this initiative, as opposed to sending orang utans out of the country,\u201d it said in a statement to Reuters.\nAdvocacy group Justice for Wildlife Malaysia said the government should consider alternative diplomatic measures, citing the need for more research on the plan\u2019s potential impact and feasibility against other conservation efforts.
