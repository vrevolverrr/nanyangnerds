Most come from shelters or are brought by animal rescue services.\nEvery year, authorities take away some 7,000 animals from owners because of neglect and Adriaens' farm is part of a network where they are placed.\nHer animals are also used as therapy animals for people with autism, depression, anxiety or drug problems. Belgium and the neighbouring Netherlands have hundreds of \"care farms\" where judicial and medical authorities send people for short- or long-term stays.\n\"Horses are also used as therapy animals, but our ostriches are more sensitive. They connect with visitors, they feel everything, and if you have negative thoughts, they step away,\" Adriaens said.\nShe added that ostriches - which can weigh up 175 kilos - will be comfortable around humans and even affectionate if treated with kindness.\nIndividual cuddling sessions with the ostriches, which typically last an hour or until the birds step away, cost 65 euros ($71) at the farm.
