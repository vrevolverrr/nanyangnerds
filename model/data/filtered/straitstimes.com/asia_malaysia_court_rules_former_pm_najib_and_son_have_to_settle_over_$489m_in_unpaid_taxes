There is no evidential basis on the record to support such a contention.\n\u201cAccordingly there is no basis for the contention that there has been a contravention of Article 8 of the Federal Constitution,\u201d she said.\nShe further said that the appellants can still bring their case for reassessment before the Special Commissioners of Income Tax (SCIT).\n\u201cHowever, it is equally clear from a perusal of the Income Tax Act 1967 (ITA) as a whole, that it is not a final determination of the sum due and owing by the taxpayer because Section 99 (1) of the ITA remains untouched and enables the taxpayer to proceed with his grievances through the SCIT and the entire hierarchy of the courts,\u201d she said.\nTan Sri Nallini pointed out that the court, under Section 106 of the ITA, is fulfilling the purpose of recovery or collection only.\n\u201cIt is not undertaking a full judicial adjudicatory role. Its full adjudicatory judicial power is deferred to the appeal arising from the decision of the SCIT by way of questions of law, or administrative or constitutional judicial review at a subsequent stage.\n\u201cThis is consonant with the \u2018pay first dispute later\u2019 mode of tax imposition by the government. In our full grounds of judgment, we have examined cases from South Africa, Australia, Hong Kong and Ghana. It is evident that the pay first, dispute later mechanism inherent in the ITA is utilised the world over,\u201d she added.\nAccording to Judge Nallini, Section 106 (3) of the ITA has a rational relation to the collection of taxes efficiently and expeditiously in that it serves to ensure that for the purposes of enforcement that section precludes matters which are deferred to the dispute resolution mode specified in the statute.\nShe said the power of constitutional review contained in Article 4 (1) of the Federal Constitution is a formidable instrument and should be wielded by the judiciary with great care.\n\u201cIf it were to be used indiscriminately or where there is no substantive basis for its invocation, the results could cause considerable damage.\n\u201cIn this appeal, it could stultify the country\u2019s tax collection system as validly provided for, and adversely affect the functioning of the government and the people. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs,\u201d she added.\nThe other judges on the panel are the Chief Judge of Malaya Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah and Federal Court judges Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Abu Bakar Jais.
