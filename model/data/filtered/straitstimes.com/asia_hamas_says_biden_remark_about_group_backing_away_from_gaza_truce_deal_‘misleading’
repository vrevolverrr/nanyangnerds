But I was told Hamas is now backing off.\u201d\nWhile boarding a plane after giving a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug 19, he added: \u201cIt remains to be seen. We\u2019re going to keep pushing.\u201d\nHamas said Mr Biden\u2019s statements do not reflect the true position of the movement, which says it has been keen to reach a cessation of hostilities.\n\u201cThe proposal recently presented to us goes against what the parties had agreed on July 2. This is considered an American response and acquiescence to the terrorist Netanyahu\u2019s new conditions and his criminal plans towards the Gaza Strip\u201d, Hamas added, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on his ninth trip to the region since the war began, expressed optimism after meeting Israeli officials on Aug 19.\nOn Aug 20, Mr Blinken was in Cairo pushing for areas of possible progress on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in talks planned for later this week, with major areas of dispute still unresolved.\nThe United States has put forward bridging proposals that it and the other mediating countries \u2013 Qatar and Egypt \u2013 believe would close gaps between Israel and Hamas and end the hostilities that have destabilised the entire region.
