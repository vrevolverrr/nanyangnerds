The Straits Times understands that the probe revolves around a deal four years ago to acquire shares in SS Ventures, the Hong Kong firm behind taxi-hailing app Flytaxi.\nEuroSports' shares rallied following the announcement, but the proposed acquisition did not materialise, with a memorandum of understanding lapsing after August 2017.\nSGX also queried EuroSports' nominating committee (NC) on whether Mr Goh is suitable to remain as company director and executive officer.\nThe firm responded that Mr Goh - who voluntarily agreed to a suspension of his duties as executive chairman, CEO and director - remains as such in name only. His younger brother, deputy CEO Andy Goh Kim Hup, has taken over as interim executive chairman and CEO until further notice.\n\"The NC is of the view that since Mr Goh will not be exercising any executive functions during his suspension, the current mitigating measures are sufficient for the time being. In the event there is any material change, the NC will review the status of Mr Goh,\" it added.\nIn response to the same query by SGX, the company's sponsor, CIMB Bank Singapore, also noted that the investigation is ongoing and to date no charge has been issued on Mr Goh.\n\"There is nothing to suggest to the sponsor that Mr Goh is not suitable to remain as a director and executive officer of the company with suspended executive powers,\" it said.\nThe sponsor added it may have to revise its assessment in the event that there are any developments in the investigation."}
