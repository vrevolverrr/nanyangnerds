But she gets off and vanishes before anyone else even stood up,\u201d he said in the video.\nHe said the crew told the passengers they will get more information once they deplane, but the only thing they learnt was that the next flight to New York will be 12 hours later.\nPassengers were also given hotel vouchers and US$12 (S$16).\nHowever, Mr Judelson, 28, noticed two girls who seemed to know more, so he approached them and was told cryptically: \u2018\u201clet\u2019s just say it was in the best interest of everyone here that they did this. It\u2019s for the safety of the plane\u2019\u201d.\nMr Judelson, who works as an executive assistant on a TV show, came to know of the real reason why the plane made an emergency landing only the next day when he went to Phoenix airport to buy snacks.\n\u201cApparently, the two girls saw lice crawling out of the woman\u2019s hair... and alerted the flight attendant and they had to ground the plane,\u201d he said in the video, referring to the woman who had rushed off the plane earlier."}
