So we strongly encourage owners of existing lorry cranes to install the SCS, but it is mandatory only for newly registered lorry cranes,\u201d he said.\nHe was addressing the Singapore Contractors Association\u2019s annual Environment, Health and Safety Campaign event at the BCA Academy on July 3.\nMOM said the system is proven technology that eliminates the risk of lorry cranes toppling, noting that based on its statistics, 63 per cent of dangerous lorry crane-related occurrences in the past decade could have been prevented if the vehicles were fitted with an SCS.\nCurrently, it is up to the crane operator and other observers to use their judgment and experience to ensure the safety of lifting operations.\nMr Ong of Tiong Woon Logistics said the new requirements for the fitting of SCS in lorry cranes will enhance the safety and efficiency of the company\u2019s operations.\n\u201cThese systems will help prevent accidents caused by instability, which in turn will reduce downtime and increase productivity,\u201d he said.\nHe added that implementing the devices across the company\u2019s fleet of lorry cranes presents challenges such as the initial investment cost, the time required for installation and operator training, as well as potential disruptions during the transition period."}
