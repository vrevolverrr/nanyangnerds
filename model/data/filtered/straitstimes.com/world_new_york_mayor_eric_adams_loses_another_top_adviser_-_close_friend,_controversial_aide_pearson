He has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\nMr Pearson, whose vast portfolio included overseeing issues related to the more than 200,000 migrants who have arrived in the city in the past two years, said in a letter to Adams that he wanted to focus on \u201cfamily, self-care and new endeavours\u201d. His resignation takes effect on Oct 4.\n\u201cDuring my tenure, I played a critical role in ensuring quality assurance for migrant services and security issues, with particular oversight of shelter sites and migrant contracts, with a focus on keeping costs down for the City,\u201d Mr Pearson said in the letter.\nIn a statement, Adams cited Mr Pearson\u2019s \u201clong career in both the public and private sectors, where he has spent over 30 years keeping New Yorkers safe\u201d. He added: \u201cWe appreciate Tim\u2019s decades of service to this city and wish him well.\u201d\nMr Pearson, who has a close friendship with Adams, has been a controversial member of the administration since the day he started in 2022.\nWhen he was appointed, he was also working for Resorts World casino in Queens, The New York Times reported. That arrangement was a potential conflict of interest as casinos began bidding for licences to build full-scale gaming facilities in New York City and its suburbs. Mr Pearson ultimately resigned from the casino company.\nMr Pearson has also been the subject of four sexual harassment lawsuits filed by former subordinates, whose claims he has denied. BLOOMBERG"}
