We also of course, do not support Hamas governance in Gaza... We\u2019ve seen where that's led all too many times for the people of Gaza and for Israel. And we also can't have anarchy and a vacuum that's likely to be filled by chaos,\" Mr Blinken said, during a press conference in Kyiv.\nThe US top diplomat has held numerous rounds of talks with Israel's Arab neighbours on a post-war plan for Gaza. Israel says it intends to keep overall security control and has baulked at proposals for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which wields limited rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to take charge.\n\"It's imperative that Israel also do this work and focus on what the future can and must be,\" Mr Blinken said. \"There needs to be a clear and concrete plan, and we look to Israel to come forward with its ideas.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Netanyahu appeared to push back against the criticism, though he did not refer directly to Mr Blinken.\nIsrael, he said, has sought out Palestinians not aligned with Hamas to take charge of local civic management in Gaza - only to see them deterred by threats of Hamas retaliation.\n\"All the talk about 'the day after', while Hamas remains intact, will remain mere words devoid of content,\" Mr Netanyahu said.\n\"Contrary to what is being claimed, for months we have been engaged in various efforts to resolve this complex problem. Some of the efforts are covert and it is good that this is so.\"\nCiting widespread support among Palestinians for Hamas\u2019 Oct 7 attack, Mr Netanyahu said, in an apparent reference to the PA: \u201cWe will not allow them to establish a terrorist state from which they will be able to vigorously attack us.\u201d REUTERS"}
