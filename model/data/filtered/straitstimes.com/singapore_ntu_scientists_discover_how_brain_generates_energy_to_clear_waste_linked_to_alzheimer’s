Found in the power-generating parts of cells known as mitochondrion, the study showed that this protein is critical for the microglia to generate their own energy to clear the toxic waste.\nIn mice with Alzheimer\u2019s disease that had the protein genetically removed, the microglia could not produce enough energy to clear the toxic waste, resulting in the disease worsening.\n\u201cWe found that microglia lacking the translocator protein resembled damaged microglia observed in ageing and Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Prof Barron.\nIn the absence of the translocator protein, the microglia cells produce energy through a second method, using an enzyme known as hexokinase-2. This enzyme binds onto the mitochondrion in the microglia cells. It then converts sugars into energy that can be used for clearing the brain\u2019s waste.\nBut this method was found to be inefficient and prevented the microglia from clearing the waste effectively. The researchers also discovered that this second method was activated when microglia cells were exposed to more toxic forms of brain waste, just as it happens in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe team said this could help explain how microglia fail in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s and when people age.\nThe researchers then tried to find a way to stop the microglia from using hexokinase-2 to produce energy. They suspected it had something to do with the hexokinase-2\u2019s ability to stick to the microglia cells\u2019 mitochondrion, which they sought to \u201cswitch off\u201d.\nTo \u201cswitch on and off\u201d this sticking ability easily, the scientists genetically modified microglia cells extracted from mice so that when blue light was shone on them, the hexokinase-2\u2019s sticking ability was turned off.\nThe scientists found that when the enzyme lost its ability to stick to the mitochondrion, the microglia cells were forced to stop using the inefficient method of energy production, improving their ability to clear the waste by nearly 20 per cent."}
