But I still hope that more Singaporean couples will decide to have more children, and to have them earlier,\u201d he said.\nTo support those who want to be parents, the Government has progressively strengthened support for infant caregiving and work-life harmony, he noted.\nSince Jan 1, government-paid paternity leave has also been doubled from two to four weeks on a voluntary basis.\nMeasures like these will lighten the burden on parents, but they are merely enablers, he said.\n\u201cUltimately, couples will decide whether to have children for their own reasons. I hope more will decide to go ahead, and I am confident they will find parenthood a deeply rewarding and fulfilling journey,\u201d he added.\nPM Lee, who has four children and is a grandfather, said bringing up children is an important element of family life, and there is great joy in watching the young ones learn, grow and reach milestones year by year.\n\u201cGrandparents, like me, share this joy too. We dote and fuss over our grandchildren, helping the parents to bring them up and contributing our part in this journey filled with happiness, purpose and love,\u201d he said.\nAs Singaporeans gather to usher in new beginnings and good luck during Chinese New Year, he urged people to celebrate their families, which are at the heart of society.\n\u201cOur families give us unwavering strength and support, cheer for us in our triumphs and stand by us through adversity. They are a big part of our sense of identity, belonging and purpose. Through our families, we pass on our aspirations and values from generation to generation,\u201d he said.\nThe Prime Minister wished all Singaporeans good health and a very happy Chinese New Year.\n\u201cEntering the Dragon Year, let us press forward with optimism and determination,\u201d he said.\nCorrection note: An earlier version of this story said Singapore\u2019s crude birth rate increased in years that fell under the Chinese zodiac sign of the dragon, including 1964. The Department of Statistics has clarified that the crude birth rate did not increase in 1964."}
