That\u2019s all they can do. But it won\u2019t help them. They won\u2019t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,\u201d said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, describing strikes that hit infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions.\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said it had carried out a \u201cmassive retaliatory strike\u201d as payback for a cross-border raid last week. It claimed to have hit all its intended targets, destroying drone bases, disrupting railways and damaging facilities that make and repair arms.\nVillagers in Zolochiv in Ukraine\u2019s western Lviv region carried a body in a black plastic bag over the rubble of a brick house completely destroyed by a missile. They put the body into the back of a white van with another. A dog lay curled up on a carpet in the ruins.\nMs Oksana Ostapenko said the house belonged to her sister Halyna, whose body was still buried under the rubble with two other family members.\n\u201cThey still haven\u2019t found them. We were hoping that they\u2019re alive. But they\u2019re not alive,\u201d she said.\nAnother civilian was reported killed by the missiles in the central Dnipro region. Three civilians were separately reported killed by artillery in Kherson.\nMoscow says such hits are intended to reduce Ukraine\u2019s ability to fight. Kyiv says the air strikes have no military purpose and aim to harm and intimidate civilians, a war crime.\nIn the capital Kyiv, a seven-hour alert through the night was the longest of Russia\u2019s five-month air campaign.\n\u201cI heard a very loud explosion, very loud. We quickly jumped out of bed and saw one car on fire. Then the other cars caught on fire as well. The glass shattered on the balconies and windows,\u201d said Liudmyla, 58, holding a toddler in her arms on a Kyiv street near wrecked cars.\n\u201cThe child got scared and jumped out of bed,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHow can they do this? How is this possible? They are not humans.\u201d\nRussia is believed to have just a few dozen Kinzhals, which fly many times faster than the speed of sound and are built to carry nuclear warheads with a range of more than 2,000km. In his speeches, President Vladimir Putin regularly touts the Kinzhal as a weapon for which the transatlantic Nato alliance backing Kyiv has no answer.\nUkraine said the attacks had knocked out power in various places including to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest, severing it from the grid and forcing it onto emergency diesel power to prevent a meltdown. It was later reconnected to Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, operator UkrenergoIt was later reconnected to Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, operator Ukrenergo said.\nThe plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the front line and both sides have warned in the past of a potential for disaster. Moscow said it was safe.\nUN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi appealed for a protection zone around the plant.\n\u201cEach time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\u201d Mr Grossi told the IAEA\u2019s 35-nation Board of Governors.\nKyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and Kharkiv were all hit. Targets stretched from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine, officials said.\nUkraine fights on at Bakhmut\nOn the battlefield, the week has seen an apparent shift as Ukraine has decided to fight on in Bakhmut, a small city that has borne the brunt of a Russian winter offensive in the bloodiest fighting of the war.\nMoscow says Bakhmut is important as a step to securing the surrounding Donbas region, a major war aim. The West says the ruined city has little value and Russian forces are sacrificing lives to give Mr Putin his only victory since sending hundreds of thousands of reservists into battle at the end of last year.\nUkraine had appeared likely to withdraw from Bakhmut, but commanders now say they are inflicting enough damage on Russia\u2019s assault force to justify staying and fighting on.\nMr Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia\u2019s Wagner private army which has led the fighting in Bakhmut, said on Wednesday his forces controlled all of the city east of a river through it.\nMoscow, which claims to have annexed a fifth of Ukraine, says it launched its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d a year ago to combat a security threat. Kyiv and the West call it an unprovoked war to subdue an independent state. REUTERS"}
