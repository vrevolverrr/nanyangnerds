The body \"was subsequently destroyed by being dismembered, once again confirming the planning of the murder\", Mr Fidan said.\nSaudi Arabia has provided shifting explanations about what happened to Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen, contributing columnist to The Washington Post and critic of the Saudi leadership, including the de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\nFor more than two weeks, the Saudi authorities repeatedly denied any knowledge of Mr Khashoggi's whereabouts, then abruptly changed their account, blaming the killing on agents acting outside the Saudi government's authority.\nTurkey's Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul told reporters yesterday that Turkey expected Saudi Arabia to cooperate in its investigation and there must be no cover-up. \"We are looking for answers to the question of where the body is,\" he said.\nWASHINGTON POST, REUTERS"}
