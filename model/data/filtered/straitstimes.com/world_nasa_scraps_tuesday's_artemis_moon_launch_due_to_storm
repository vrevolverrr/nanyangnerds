But if it has to be sheltered, the current launch window, which runs until Oct 4, will be missed.\nThe next launch window will run from Oct 17 to 31, with one possibility of take-off per day, except from Oct 24-26 and 28.\nThe Artemis 1 space mission hopes to test the SLS as well as the unmanned Orion capsule that sits atop, in preparation for future moon-bound journeys with humans aboard.\nA successful Artemis 1 mission will come as a huge relief to the US space agency, after years of delays and cost overruns."}
