The stock has gained 44 per cent in 2024, lifted by the company\u2019s burgeoning AI equipment sales.\nThough Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of AI spending, Broadcom is making fast headway in the market. It sells a range of components to data centre operators, which are rapidly expanding their facilities to accommodate AI services. Broadcom\u2019s AI sales will be more than US$11 billion in fiscal 2024, chief executive officer Hock Tan has said.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman, meanwhile, has been working to raise billions of dollars from global investors for a chip venture, aiming to use the funds to set up a network of factories to manufacture semiconductors with chipmakers Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics as potential partners, Bloomberg reported earlier in 2024.
