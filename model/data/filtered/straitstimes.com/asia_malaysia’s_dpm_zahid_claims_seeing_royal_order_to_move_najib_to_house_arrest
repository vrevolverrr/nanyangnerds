The former premier was imprisoned in 2022 on abuse of power and money-laundering charges in relation to 1MDB, a troubled state fund.\nThe court will decide whether to hear Najib\u2019s request on June 5, his lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told reporters on April 17. Its decision is set to draw more scrutiny to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s commitment to fight graft.\nThe royal leniency granted to Najib earlier in 2024 sparked a backlash against Datuk Seri Anwar, who rose to power in November 2022 on an anti-corruption platform. His government, which counts Umno as a key ally, has already withdrawn 47 criminal charges against Mr Zahid.\nReducing sentence\nAt a Pardons Board meeting on Jan 29, Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah decided to halve Najib\u2019s jail term to six years and reduced his 1MDB-related fines to RM50 million (S$14 million). It was one of the last acts by the royal ruler, who ended his five-year reign under Malaysia\u2019s rotational monarchy on Jan 30.\nPardons are granted at the sole discretion of the king, with advice from a board of government officials and appointees.\nNajib, in his latest application, requested that the court compel the government to verify the existence of the king\u2019s supplementary order and, upon confirmation, execute it so that he may be moved to his residence in Kuala Lumpur.\nMr Shafee told reporters outside the courtroom on April 17 that they also received affidavits from other witnesses in their favour, but were unable to file them in time.\nNajib, who lost power about six years ago, was accused of transferring RM42 million from 1MDB subsidiary SRC International to his personal account between 2014 and 2015.\nHe remains widely popular in Malaysia but still faces trials for dozens of other criminal charges related to the wealth fund, which became the centre of a multibillion dollar scandal that spawned probes across the world.
