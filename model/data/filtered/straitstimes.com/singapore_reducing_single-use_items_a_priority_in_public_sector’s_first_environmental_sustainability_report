Collection of this data started in 2020.\nEmissions are expected to peak around 2025 as more activities resume post-pandemic, and more new major public infrastructure projects for transport, healthcare and utilities are completed in the coming years.\nThe sources of emissions in the report come from Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 1 refers to direct emissions \u2013 such as emissions from facilities or vehicles that run on fossil fuels like natural gas, petrol and diesel. Waste incineration as part of waste management services is also a form of direct emission.\nIn FY2022, Scope 1 emissions were at 1.37 million tonnes, while Scope 2 emissions were at 2.3 million tonnes.\nThe use of electricity comes under Scope 2 emissions. Over 90 per cent of electricity in Singapore is generated using natural gas.\nThe report said the public sector used 5,591 gigawatt hours of electricity and 32.9 billion litres of water in FY2022. Both were benchmarked against the average of 2018 to 2020 to better reflect hybrid working arrangements post-pandemic.\nWater usage rose 1.2 per cent, mainly due to a gradual re-opening of the economy post-pandemic and an increase in activities. The increase of 1.7 per cent in electricity usage was attributed to the expansion of the public transport network and healthcare facilities.\nSaid Mr Baey: \u201cBy tracking how much it has consumed, the public sector will be motivated to identify gaps and opportunities to reduce its footprint further.\u201d"}
