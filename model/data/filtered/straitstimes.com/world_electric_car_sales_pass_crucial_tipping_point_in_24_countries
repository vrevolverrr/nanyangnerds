But then came the 1980s, and quicker than you could say \u201cHot Pockets,\u201d microwaves had spread to nearly every kitchen.\nThat fast part of the technology adoption curve is happening now with electric vehicles, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of adoption rates around the world.\nWhen Bloomberg first completed this analysis a year ago, 19 countries had passed what\u2019s become a critical EV tipping point: 5 per cent of new car sales powered only by electricity. This threshold signals the start of mass adoption, when technological preferences rapidly flip. Since then, five more countries have made the leap.\nThe newcomers \u2013 Canada, Australia, Spain, Thailand and Hungary \u2013 join a cohort that also includes the US, China and most of Western Europe. The trajectory laid out by these early adopters shows how EVs can surge from 5 per cent to 25 per cent of new cars in just four years.\nWhy 5 per cent is so important?\nMost successful new technologies \u2013 televisions, mobile phones, LED lightbulbs \u2013 follow an S-shaped adoption curve. Sales move at a crawl in the early-adopter phase, then quickly once things go mainstream.\nIn the case of fully electric vehicles, 5 per cent seems to be the inflection point. The time it takes to get to that level varies widely by country, but once the universal challenges of car costs, charger availability and driver scepticism are solved for the few, the masses soon follow.\nIn the US, the EV tipping point didn\u2019t arrive until late 2021 \u2013 relatively late for a country with its spending power.\nThere were reasons for that delay. Americans spend more time in their cars than any other populace, and drivers demanded longer ranges than early models offered. Pickups and large SUVs, which make up more than half of the US market, were also slow to electrify due to their massive battery needs.\nToday, US EV sales are rising fast \u2013 up 42 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago \u2013 but haven\u2019t quite matched the explosive trajectory of other countries that crossed over.\nThat could change as Tesla, the world\u2019s biggest EV maker, prepares to launch its Cybertruck pickup, and as competitors roll out EVs under some of the most iconic American brands: Chevy Blazer and Silverado, Ford Explorer and F-150, Jeep Wrangler and Ram 1500, to name a few.\nA tipping point may be on the horizon for India, the third-largest car market after China and the US. EVs made up 3 per cent of new car sales in the country last quarter, after doubling in just six months.\nIndia\u2019s home-grown carmakers have been investing heavily in electrification, and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June. Mr Musk said he plans to enter the market \u201cas soon as humanly possible.\u201d\nCountries that cross the tipping point have seen rapid rates of adoption, with a median sales growth of 55 per cent last quarter compared to the same period a year ago. As with any new technology, growth rates will eventually slow as a market nears saturation \u2013 the top of the adoption S curve.\nThere will always be holdouts. In Norway, the world\u2019s EV pioneer, growth appears to be slowing after reaching 80 per cent of new vehicles.\nA higher bar for hybrids\nThe analysis above is for vehicles that run on batteries only.\nSome countries, primarily in Europe, were quicker to adopt plug-in hybrids, which have smaller batteries backed by a petrol-powered engine. Other countries, including the US and China, mostly skipped hybrids and went straight to fully electric vehicles.\nIf hybrids are included, the world sold more than 10 million plug-in vehicles last year, a figure that could triple by 2027, according to forecasts by BloombergNEF.\nBecause hybrids don\u2019t require the same level of infrastructure or consumer commitment as fully electric cars, the early phase of adoption for them can be more erratic and full of false starts.\nA new hybrid model of a popular car might boost the share of plug-ins by a few percentage points without signifying a more widespread shift in consumer preferences.\nA consistent tipping point for this broader category of EVs wasn\u2019t achieved until 10 per cent of new vehicles were either hybrid or fully electric. At that point, sales in any given country tend to go mainstream.\nThe US, Australia and Canada each came within fractions of a per cent of crossing the 10 per cent tipping point for plug-in sales last quarter. In the US, hybrid sales could pick up thanks to generous new incentives that went into effect this year.\nTipping the carmakers\nThe concept of tipping points has often been used to describe price thresholds that trigger wider adoption.\nIn the early days of renewable energy, for example, reaching the point at which it became cheaper to install new solar farms than to build new coal plants accelerated solar demand from utilities.\nSometimes sales volume itself can mark a turning point.\nAfter Tesla started selling the Model 3 in 2017, the company nearly sent itself into bankruptcy when it wasn\u2019t able to make vehicles fast enough to drive down unit costs. Tesla executives determined that pushing production past 5,000 cars a week would kick off a virtuous circle of declining costs and higher volumes, which is what happened.\nContinued growth in EVs depends on the ability of traditional carmakers and their suppliers to make similar blind-faith investments before demand has fully materialised.\nFactories must be retooled and supply chains reconfigured. To achieve the most savings, the entire vehicle must be redesigned with electrification in mind. Transition costs can be suffocating until sales go mainstream.\nThat means individual carmakers also have a tipping point: the threshold after which EV sales become self-reinforcing.\nIn Europe\u2019s experience, once 10 per cent of a carmaker\u2019s quarterly sales came with plugs, that share tripled in less than two years, on average.\nIs the global transition to EVs inevitable?\nSo far, 90 per cent of the world\u2019s EV sales have come from the US, China and Europe. That means countries responsible for about a third of motor vehicle sales globally have yet to pass the tipping point. Just four of the 20 most populous countries have made the pivot. Even if the circles of demand continue to widen, it\u2019s uncertain whether miners will be able to keep up the pace for critical battery materials.\nStill, global sales of new internal combustion engines peaked in 2017, and net growth for car sales is now driven entirely by EVs. That\u2019s a trend that BloombergNEF forecasts suggest will continue until the gas-powered automobile is a museum curiosity \u2013 whether that takes another decade or five.\nGovernments are also putting more thumbs on the scales.\nIn the US, where the Biden administration is calling for EVs and hybrids to make up half of new vehicles by 2030, the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and 2022 Inflation Reduction Act are directing hundreds of billions in public and private funding into everything from highway charging networks to battery-recycling plants.\nThe US battery pipeline through 2030 increased 67 per cent in the last year alone and has caught up with Europe, according to Benchmark Materials.\nForecasting technology adoption is treacherous business. Even the most careful outlooks can be knocked off course by supply-chain disruptions, economic shifts, politics, bankruptcies and popular culture.\nThe advantage of the tipping-points approach is that it reveals a range of adoption curves that are at least known to be possible \u2013 because they\u2019ve already occurred.\nApplying the framework to the entire planet, the EV tipping point was passed in 2021.\nIf the trends hold true, the rest of this decade will be remembered for doing for electric cars what the 1980s did for the microwave oven.\nMethodology note: Italy passed 5 per cent EV sales for two anomalous quarters in 2021 before returning below the threshold for 2022 and 2023. It has been removed from the tipping points list until additional data are available. BLOOMBERG"}
