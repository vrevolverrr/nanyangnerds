However, it is like a double-edged sword, as it can cause damage from abuse,\u201d Mr Kim added.\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said discussions would cover areas such as a legal review to ensure compliance with international law and mechanisms to prevent autonomous weapons from making life-and-death decisions without appropriate human oversight.\nThe Seoul summit hoped to agree to a blueprint for action, establishing a minimum level of guard rails for AI in the military and suggesting principles on responsible use by reflecting principles laid out by Nato, by the US or a number of other countries, according to a senior South Korean official.\nIt was unclear how many nations attending the summit would endorse the document on Sept 10, which is aiming to be a more detailed attempt to set boundaries on AI use in the military, but still likely lack legal commitments.\nThe summit is not the only international set of discussions on AI use in the military.\nUN countries that belong to the 1983 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons are discussing potential restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons systems for compliance with international humanitarian law.\nThe US government in 2023 also launched a declaration on responsible use of AI in the military, which covers broader military application of AI, beyond weapons. As at August, 55 countries have endorsed the declaration.\nThe Seoul summit, co-hosted by the Netherlands, Singapore, Kenya and Britain, aims to ensure ongoing multi-stakeholder discussions in a field where technological developments are primarily driven by the private sector, but governments are the main decision-makers.\nAbout 2,000 people globally have registered to take part in the summit, including representatives from international organisations, academia and the private sector, to attend discussions on topics such as civilian protection and AI use in the control of nuclear weapons.
