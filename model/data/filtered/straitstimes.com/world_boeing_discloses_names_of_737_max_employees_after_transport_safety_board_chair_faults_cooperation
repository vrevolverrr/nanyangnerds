She also said the NTSB had been unable to interview the door team\u2019s manager, who was on medical leave.\nSeparately, she told Reuters the NTSB planned to hold a multiple-day investigative hearing into the Max 9, likely in late summer, which will include testimony from staff at Boeing and fuselage manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems.\nMs Homendy confirmed that inspections of all other Max 9 planes in service found no other missing bolts.\nThe planemaker has scrambled to explain and strengthen safety procedures since the January mid-air incident that led to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounding the Max 9 for several weeks. The company has been the subject of increased scrutiny from regulators and airlines concerned about the quality of jet production.\nMs Homendy said the NTSB did not know which employees removed the bolts and failed to reinstall them.\n\u201cThe NTSB needs to interview the employees,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not about blame at the NTSB. This is the only way we ensure safety... find out what happened, what was done, what was not done, what policies are in place.\u201d\nShe said she was not suggesting any malfeasance on Boeing\u2019s part. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we\u2019ve requested the information. We don\u2019t have the information.\u201d\nSenator Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, called it \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d that the NTSB was not receiving full cooperation from Boeing and asked for an update from Ms Homendy within a week.\nMs Homendy also confirmed that the Max 9 door plug had moved during prior flights, citing markings on the door.\nThere were 154 prior flights by the Alaska Airlines Max 9 jet before the Jan 5 incident.\n\u201cThere were very small movements until it eventually came out,\u201d Ms Homendy said, adding that testing showed \u201cyou could see a bit of a gap towards the end\u201d but that it was not clear how noticeable it was.\nFAA administrator Mike Whitaker said last week Boeing must develop a comprehensive plan to address \u201csystemic quality control issues\u201d within 90 days, following an all-day meeting with Mr Calhoun on Feb 27.\nAn FAA audit of 737 production found \u201cnon-compliance issues in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control\u201d, the agency said on March 4.
