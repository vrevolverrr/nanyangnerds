He also faces several other graft charges.\nThe Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers was expected to appeal against Najib\u2019s acquittal earlier in 2023 of a charge of abusing his position as prime minister to amend a government audit into 1MDB.\nBut Najib\u2019s lawyers at Shafee & Co said in a statement that \u201cthe prosecution evidently found no grounds for appeal\u201d and did not file the petition.\nNajib had pleaded not guilty.\nAn estimated US$4.5 billion (S$6.1 billion) was allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the US Justice Department has alleged.\nMr Anwar, who came to power in November 2022, vowed to fight corruption as part of his election campaign. But concerns were raised after he partnered with Najib\u2019s corruption-tainted party to form a government and appointed officials accused of graft to senior positions.\nThe Malaysian United Democratic Alliance on Sunday said it was leaving Mr Anwar\u2019s ruling coalition, citing concerns after graft charges were dropped against Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.\nMr Anwar has maintained that the move to drop the case, which triggered a widespread public backlash, was made without his interference.
