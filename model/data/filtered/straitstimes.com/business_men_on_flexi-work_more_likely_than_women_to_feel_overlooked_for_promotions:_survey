The majority said both parties could play the role.\nThese findings were consistent across generations, noted SHE in its report.\nWhen asked who should take a step back from their career if family circumstances require it, 27 per cent of respondents chose mothers or women, while only 4 per cent chose fathers or men; the rest said the responsibility should be shared equally.\nFlexi-work arrangements came into the spotlight earlier in 2024, when the Government announced new tripartite guidelines making it compulsory from Dec 1 for employers to fairly consider formal requests for such arrangements.\nPanellists at an event by SHE on July 22 discussed the survey findings and suggested ways for more men, women and employers to adopt flexi-work arrangements as the norm.\nNational Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Yeo Wan Ling, who is the director of NTUC\u2019s U Women and Family and U SME units, recommended that companies shift to outcomes-based performance appraisals so that people who take parental leave or use flexi-work arrangements are not disadvantaged.\nBosses can also check in with subordinates more frequently throughout the year, as this can reduce the impact of face-time \u2013 of which people working remotely are likely to have less \u2013 on appraisals, she said during one of the panel discussions at the event at NTUC Centre.\n\u201cWe need to look at helping workplaces transform to become more equitable in terms of compensation and promotions,\u201d she told more than 100 people in the audience, who included senior managers, human resources professionals and members of community organisations.\nSome of the panellists also highlighted the need to make flexi-work the norm, so that men can be more comfortable bringing up their caregiving responsibilities at work.\nMs Ong Ai Hua, deputy secretary (family and society) at the Ministry of Social and Family Development, said that it would be helpful for men to have more role models of other men taking leave, and to hear from male colleagues who take on more caregiving duties at home about how they worked out arrangements with their supervisors.\nAlthough the food and beverage industry is not typically known for providing flexible work arrangements, panellists Mustaffa Kamal, co-founder and chief executive of F&B group The Black Hole Group, and Bernadette Giam, director of corporate affairs and human resources at Creative Eateries, another F&B group, spoke about how their companies have offered greater flexibility to their staff.\nMr Mustaffa said his company started planning the schedules of its 150 or so operational employees a month in advance, instead of a week in advance, to give them more certainty when it comes to planning family commitments.\n\u201cSpending family time and making sure that family affairs at home are stable would put you in the right state of mind to come to work and be able to contribute in an optimal manner,\u201d said Mr Mustaffa.\nMs Giam noted that higher costs may seem inevitable, such as in having to deal with more variability when employing casual workers to cover the shifts of regular workers who are on reduced hours, and in having to pay managers more for dealing with more people and for implementing new frameworks for staff to follow.\nBut there is a cost to not trying to retain employees, she said.\nThis was also borne out in the SHE survey, which found that close to one in five workers currently on flexi-work said that if their employers stopped offering the flexibility, they would quit or look for another job that was more flexible.\nSHE chairwoman Stefanie Yuen Thio said at the event that improving flexibility for workers is important for Singapore as its economy relies on people and the skills they bring to the workforce.\n\u201cOur one resource is something that\u2019s going to be less tap-able if we continue to let these gender mindsets rule the day,\u201d she said."}
