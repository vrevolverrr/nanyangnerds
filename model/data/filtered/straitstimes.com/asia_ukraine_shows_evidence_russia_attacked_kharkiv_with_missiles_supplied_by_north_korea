There are deviations from standard Iskander missiles, which we previously saw during strikes on Kharkiv. This missile is similar to one of the North Korean missiles,\u201d Mr Chubenko told media, as he displayed the remnants.\nHe said the missile was slightly bigger in diameter than the Russian Iskander missile, while its nozzle, internal electrical windings and rear parts were also different.\n\u201cThat is why we are leaning towards the version that this may be a missile which was supplied by North Korea.\u201d\nMr Chubenko declined to give the missile\u2019s exact model name.\nRussia attacked Kharkiv with several missiles last week, killing two people and injuring more than 60 in one of its biggest missile and drone strikes since the start of the large-scale war in February 2022.\nNorth Korea has been under a United Nations arms embargo since it first tested a nuclear bomb in 2006.\nUN Security Council resolutions \u2013 approved with Russian support \u2013 ban countries from trading weapons or other military equipment with North Korea.
