British marines conduct a night-time beach landing. French paratroopers drop from the skies after flying across Europe.\nIn Estonia, on Nato\u2019s eastern flank, the allies train in the shadow of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.\nThe message is clear.\n\u201cIt says that at short notice, we can deploy very fast,\u201d said Lieutenant-Colonel Edouard Bros, commander of the French troops in Estonia and taking part in the Spring Storm exercise.\nFifteen months into Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and a month ahead of a summit of Nato leaders in Vilnius, the alliance is reinforcing its eastern defences.\nNow that Moscow has ripped up decades of post-Cold War order, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is conducting the biggest overhaul to its defences and planning in a generation.\n\u201cThis change will move us from an alliance that was optimised for out-of-area contingency operations to an alliance fit for the purpose of large-scale operations to defend every inch of the alliance\u2019s territory,\u201d US General Christopher Cavoli, Nato\u2019s supreme commander in Europe, said in May. \u201cThis is necessitated by the new realities we face.\u201d\nAt a summit in Madrid in 2022, spurred on by the destruction Russian troops wrought in Ukraine, Nato reverted to \u201cdeterrence by denial\u201d as it had during the Cold War stand-off with the Soviet Union.\nThat means stopping any attack by Moscow at the borders, rather than being willing to cede frontline territory such as the Baltics, which would then need to be recaptured.\n\u201cWhat is clear is that Nato made a strategic shift,\u201d said Mr Kristjan Mae, head of the policy planning department at Estonia\u2019s Defence Ministry. \u201cCollective defence is the most important task and we need to get our house in order.\u201d\nSince Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the alliance has added thousands more troops to its eastern flank.\nIt has deployed four more multinational \u201cbattle groups\u201d in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to those set up on Russia\u2019s border in Poland and the Baltic states in the wake of Moscow\u2019s 2014 seizure of Crimea.\nNato members are now planning how to scale up deployments to Baltic nations and Poland to brigade-size, which would mean adding thousands more troops, \u201cwhere and when required\u201d.\nMilitary hardware \u2013 time-consuming and complicated to lug across the continent \u2013 is being pre-positioned in the east and exercises are being stepped up.\nFor Estonia, Britain will have troops on standby at their home bases ready to rush to the country to bolster the roughly 1,000 British and French troops already on the ground.\n\u201cThat is a key shift \u2013 the extra layer of capability in time to be part of the in-place force prior to the outbreak of a conflict,\u201d said Brigadier Giles Harris, British commander of the Nato deployment.\nWhile Estonia seems satisfied with that model, its neighbour Lithuania wants more troops consistently on the ground and is still discussing with its lead partner Germany on how to get them.\nThese deployments, along with the militaries of the front-line nations, are Nato\u2019s forward defence.\nBack in their headquarters, Nato commanders are drawing up more detailed plans \u2013 to be approved by leaders in Vilnius \u2013 on how the alliance would defend each region.\nThat involves details of how many forces from which countries would go where, integrating national and Nato defence planning and setting clearer spending priorities for new gear.\nNato membership for Finland and eventually Sweden will also help bolster the eastern flank, but commanders must decide how the Scandinavian neighbours fit into broader plans.\nThe allies plan to have a pool of 300,000 troops ready to deploy within 30 days and will hold a conference at the end of June to commit soldiers.\nAll these new deployments and plans will inevitably require money, resources and forces.\n\u201cIf nations need more time, or nations have less money, or there are all sorts of things that happen along the way, then it will have an impact of reaching that ideal situation,\u201d said Admiral Rob Bauer, chair of Nato\u2019s military committee.\nAhead of the Vilnius summit, Nato members are haggling over a new pledge to boost defence spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).\nJust seven alliance members hit the 2 per cent target set in 2022 and the aim for Vilnius will be agreeing to turn that target into a baseline.\nEstonia, which has never stopped viewing Russia as an existential threat, wants allies to commit to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence.\nEstonia insists it is pulling its weight. The country of 1.4 million is already boosting defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP, setting up a new army division and buying modern weaponry.\nFaced by its aggressive giant neighbour, it now wants Nato\u2019s new defence strategies to become operable as soon as possible.\n\u201cOne thing is to have good plans on paper. The other thing is to have these executable and implementable,\u201d said Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur, surrounded by British and French armoured vehicles at the Spring Storm exercise.\n\u201cSo this is the task. And this is the challenge for all of us.\u201d AFP"}
