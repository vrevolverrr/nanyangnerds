All committee members noted that it would be appropriate for policy \u201cto remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably\u201d towards the 2 per cent target, said the minutes, which were published on Nov 21.\nThe remarks \u2013 which echo warnings from several policymakers, including Mr Powell \u2013 tempered some of the hope that the bank would slash rates in 2024, with some commentators having pencilled in such a move in March.\nHowever, it did little to fan fears of more hikes on the way, with any increase in Treasury yields seen as doing enough to tighten financial conditions.\n\u201cIf we were to see stronger economic and inflation data before the December meeting, longer-term rates are likely to rebound and substitute for a rate hike. Therefore, we do not expect further hikes,\u201d said senior US strategist Philip Marey at Rabobank.\nThere is a belief among many traders that the Fed has managed to guide the world\u2019s No. 1 economy to a soft landing.\nDespite the Fed\u2019s decision to aggressively tighten monetary policy since March 2022, economic growth has remained strong and the labour market has been fairly buoyant \u2013 although it has shown some recent signs of slowing.\nThe strong recent economic data has increased the likelihood of a soft landing, whereby the Fed succeeds in tackling inflation without plunging the US into recession.\nEconomic forecasts prepared by Fed staff for the most recent rate-setting meeting expected fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth \u201cto slow markedly from its third-quarter rate\u201d, the Fed said on Nov 21. \u201cAll told, however, average GDP growth over the second half of the year was projected to be a little faster than the first half\u2019s pace,\u201d it added.\nThe Fed said back in September that it expected the US economy to grow by 2.1 per cent in 2023, and by 1.5 per cent in 2024.
