Developed by the US space agency with its counterparts in France and Canada, Swot was one of 15 missions listed by the National Research Council as projects Nasa should undertake in the coming decade.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the first mission to observe nearly all water on the planet\u2019s surface,\u201d said JPL scientist Ben Hamlington, who also leads Nasa\u2019s sea-level change team.\nOne major thrust of the mission is to explore how oceans absorb atmospheric heat and carbon dioxide in a natural process that moderates global temperatures and climate change.\nScanning the seas from orbit, Swot is designed to precisely measure fine differences in surface elevations around smaller currents and eddies, where much of the oceans\u2019 drawdown of heat and carbon is believed to occur. And Swot can do so with 10 times greater resolution than existing technologies, according to JPL.\nLooking for ocean\u2019s tipping point\nOceans are estimated to have absorbed more than 90 per cent of the excess heat trapped in earth\u2019s atmosphere by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.\nStudying the mechanism by which that happens will help climate scientists answer a key question \u2013 \u201cWhat is the turning point at which oceans start releasing, rather than absorbing, huge amounts of heat back into the atmosphere and accelerate global warming, rather than limiting it,\u201d said Dr Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, Swot\u2019s programme scientist at Nasa in Washington.\nSwot\u2019s ability to discern smaller surface features will also be used to study the impact of rising ocean levels on coastlines.\nMore precise data along tidal zones would help predict how far storm-surge flooding may penetrate inland, as well as the extent of saltwater intrusion into estuaries, wetlands and underground aquifers.\nFreshwater bodies are another key focus for Swot, which is equipped to observe the entire length of nearly all rivers wider than 100m, as well as more than one million lakes and reservoirs larger than 62,500 sq m.\nTaking inventory of earth\u2019s water resources repeatedly over Swot\u2019s three-year mission will enable researchers to better trace fluctuations in rivers and lakes during seasonal changes and major weather events.\nNasa\u2019s Swot freshwater science lead Tamlin Pavelsky said collecting such data is akin to \u201ctaking the pulse of the world\u2019s water system, so we\u2019ll be able to see when it\u2019s racing, and we\u2019ll be able to see when it\u2019s slow\u201d.\nSwot\u2019s radar instrument operates at the so-called Ka-band frequency of the microwave spectrum. It allows scans to penetrate cloud cover and darkness over wide swathes of the earth.\nThis enables scientists to accurately map their observations in two dimensions regardless of weather or time of day and to cover large geographic areas far more quickly than before.\nBy comparison, previous studies of water bodies relied on data taken at specific points, such as river or ocean gauges, or from satellites that can track measurements only along a one-dimensional line, requiring scientists to fill in data gaps through extrapolation.\n\u201cRather than giving us a line of elevations, it\u2019s giving us a map of elevations, and that\u2019s just a total game changer,\u201d said Dr Pavelsky.
