Much of the current client base is of Indian origin and the rest comes from a variety of backgrounds, from Europe to other parts of Asia, said Mr Tucker.\nFarro\u2019s rapid asset accumulation underscores Singapore\u2019s continuing appeal to the super rich, despite recent efforts to raise wealth taxes and introduce stricter conditions for tax breaks. While the city has gained recognition in recent years for seeing an influx of wealthy Chinese families, its low levies and relative stability are attracting a menagerie of global tycoons.\n\u201cWe are targeting families across the region from Japan to the UK and the United States \u2013 whoever wants to have access to Asia with Singapore as a centre,\u201d said Mr Tibrewal.\nHe added that the company is looking at \u201cadding another 50 families in the next 18 to 24 months\u201d, with an average AUM contribution of US$30 million each.\nMore than 700 family offices \u2013 organisations that manage the lives and affairs of the super rich \u2013 were based in Singapore as at the end of 2021, according to official estimates. More have set up there since, despite the imposition of tighter rules last April.\nIndian tycoon Mukesh Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man, opened a family office in Singapore last year, joining Google co-founder Sergey Brin, American hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio and British billionaire inventor James Dyson, among others.\nFarro\u2019s base in downtown Singapore is a simple office with a single boardroom, far from the glitzy, art-filled lobbies of many of its peers. It aims to have 20 employees by the end of the year who are able to do everything from negotiating bank fees and sourcing deals to arranging home loans and making portfolios compliant with environmental, social and governance criteria. Its fees vary depending on the level of work required.\nAmong its key targets are family offices whose assets are big enough to have a handful of dedicated professionals but too small to warrant hiring a full-service team.\nFarro aims to fill the gaps, providing anything from investment opportunities to arranging trusts. One of its co-founders is Mr Mahesh Kumar, who worked at law firm Withers KhattarWong helping private clients with their tax strategies.\n\u201cWe are seeing more first-generation entrepreneurs than ever before and I would say that is more prevalent in a place like India,\u201d said Mr Nirbhay Handa, head of private clients in Asia at Henley & Partners, which helps wealthy customers set up residency and investments around the world. \u201cWhen wealth increases, generally, you see an uptick of a lot of families looking at a place like Singapore to set up their wealth structuring outfits.\u201d\nMr Handa said interest among wealthy entrepreneurs of Indian origin in moving assets or relocating to Singapore remains high, even though it has not increased at the same rate as that of Chinese peers.
