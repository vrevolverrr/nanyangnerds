Analysts say it will likely take more market share from iPhone manufacturer Apple, while policymakers in Washington are questioning the efficacy of US curbs on the telecoms equipment giant.\nChina-made flash memory chip\nEarlier analysis by teardown firms such as TechInsights of the Mate 60, launched in August 2023, found the phone to be using Dram and Nand memory chips made by South Korea\u2019s SK Hynix. SK Hynix said at the time it no longer did business with Huawei and analysts said the chips likely came from stockpiles.\nThe Pura 70 still contains a Dram chip made by SK Hynix, iFixit and TechSearch found, but the Nand flash memory chip was likely packaged by Huawei\u2019s HiSilicon unit this time around and was made up of Nand dies each with a capacity of 1 terabit. This is comparable to products made by major flash memory producers such as SK Hynix, Kioxia and Micron.\nHowever, the firms were unable to definitively identify the manufacturer of the wafer as the markings on the Nand die were unfamiliar, they added. But iFixit added that it believed that HiSilicon may have produced the memory controller as well.\n\u201cIn our teardown our chip ID expert has identified it as a particular HiSilicon chip,\u201d Mr Mokhtari said.\nSK Hynix reiterated that it was \u201cstrictly complying with the relevant policies since the restrictions against Huawei were announced and has also suspended any transactions with the company since then\u201d.\nIncremental improvements\nIFixit and TechSearch\u2019s analysis of the processor used by the Pura 70 Pro also suggests Huawei may have made only incremental improvements in its ability to produce an advanced chip with Chinese partners in the months since it launched the Mate 60 series.\nThe processor is similar to the one employed in the Mate 60 series that was produced for Huawei by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) using the Chinese chip foundry\u2019s 7 nanometer (nm) N+2 manufacturing process, they said.\n\u201cThis is significant because news of the 9000S on a 7nm node caused a bit of a panic last year when US lawmakers were confronted with the possibility that the sanctions imposed on Chinese chipmakers might not slow their technological progress after all,\u201d iFixit said.\n\u201cThe fact that the 9010 is still a 7nm process chip, and that it\u2019s so close to the 9000S, might seem to suggest that Chinese chip manufacturing has indeed been slowed.\u201d\nStill, he cautioned against underestimating Huawei, saying that SMIC was still expected to make a leap to a 5nm manufacturing node before the end of the year.\nSMIC did not respond to a request for comment.
