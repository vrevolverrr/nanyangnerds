Should they apply for subsidies to cover their medication, they will get a 75 per cent subsidy without any dollar cap, with the annual limit at $330.\nMost Healthier SG enrollees, therefore, will likely not need to switch to the new tier. But clinic assistant Kathleen Koh, 43, still signed up for it.\nShe has had hypertension since she was 19, but was put on medication only when she was in her mid-30s.\n\u201cWhen the readings spiked, both my doctor and I got worried,\u201d she told The Straits Times.\n\u201cFor each visit to the clinic in Buangkok, the bill is about $80. But I have the blue Chas card and I am fully subsidised, so I did not have to pay a cent.\u201d\nBut Ms Koh signed up for the new tier under Healthier SG \u201cin case I suffer from more chronic diseases when I get older\u201d.\nMOH said in its statement that more than 1,000 Healthier SG GP clinics will be ready to offer enhanced subsidies for selected medications under the Healthier SG Chronic Tier.\nThe remaining clinics, making up less than 5 per cent of eligible ones, are expected to be ready in the coming weeks after completing the required logistical preparation.\nPatients enrolled at these remaining clinics may continue to tap their existing Chas subsidies.\nAlso, from Feb 1, enrolled residents with chronic conditions can use their MediSave savings of up to between $500 and $700 to fully pay for their treatment at the enrolled primary care clinic, instead of having to co-pay 15 per cent of their bill in cash.\nAs at Jan 23, about 700,000 Singapore residents have enrolled in Healthier SG.\nResidents aged 40 and above can enrol with their preferred Healthier SG GP clinic or polyclinic through the HealthHub app or at any of the 39 enrolment stations located in community centres and clubs or polyclinics."}
