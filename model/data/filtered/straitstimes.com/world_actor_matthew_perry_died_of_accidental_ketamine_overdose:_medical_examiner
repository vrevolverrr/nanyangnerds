The manner of death is accident.\u201d\nKetamine is illegally used as a recreational drug for its numbing and hallucinogenic effects. It can also be used by doctors as an anaesthetic, and researchers are exploring its use as a mental health treatment.\nPerry wrote in his memoirs of how he had relied on using ketamine daily at points during his battles with addiction. He said the drug eased his pain and helped with depression.\n\u201cHas my name written all over it \u2013 they might as well have called it \u2018Matty\u2019,\u201d he wrote of ketamine. \u201cTaking K is like being hit in the head with a giant happy shovel. But the hangover was rough and outweighed the shovel.\u201d\nHe attended multiple rehabilitation clinics to combat addiction to painkillers and alcohol. In 2018, he suffered a burst colon, related to drug usage, and underwent multiple operations.\nIn his memoir Friends, Lovers And The Big Terrible Thing, published in 2022, Perry described going through detox dozens of times. He dedicated the book to \u201call of the sufferers out there\u201d, and wrote in the prologue: \u201cI should be dead.\u201d\n\u201cI have mostly been sober since 2001,\u201d he wrote, \u201csave for about sixty or seventy little mishaps over the years.\u201d\nThe examiner\u2019s report does not specify how or when Perry had consumed the fatal dose of ketamine.\nBut it found that trace amounts were detected in his stomach, and that prescription medications and loose pills were present at his home.\nPerry was undergoing medical treatment involving ketamine, but his most recent known infusion was more than a week before his death, meaning that dose would no longer have been in his system.\nThe examiner\u2019s report says the levels of ketamine in Perry\u2019s blood were comparable with higher-range levels used as general anaesthetic in surgery, and would cause overstimulation of the heart and problems breathing.\nThis could have caused him to lapse into unconsciousness, with drowning then becoming a contributory cause of death.\nPerry\u2019s coronary artery disease, and his use of buprenorphine to treat severe pain, would have made him more vulnerable to the effects of ketamine, the report finds.\nNo alcohol was detected in his system by the autopsy report. Nor were there any traces of other drugs such as cocaine, heroin or fentanyl.\n\u2018The six of us\u2019\nPerry\u2019s sudden passing in October drew shocked reactions from Hollywood A-listers, his co-stars and fans of Friends worldwide.\n\u201cOh boy, this one has cut deep,\u201d said American actress Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel on the show.\n\u201cHe was such a part of our DNA. We were always the six of us. This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be,\u201d she wrote on Instagram."}
