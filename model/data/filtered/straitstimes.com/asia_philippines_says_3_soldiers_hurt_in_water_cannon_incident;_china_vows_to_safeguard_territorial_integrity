We will not be intimidated,\u201d Mr Ano said, vowing that the Philippines would continue to resupply the garrison on Second Thomas Shoal.\nThe United States, which has a mutual defence pact with Manila, has denounced the attack.\n\u201cThe (Chinese) actions are destabilising to the region and show clear disregard for international law,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.\nChina\u2019s Defence Ministry defended the coast guard\u2019s actions, and warned the Philippines on March 24 against \u201cprovocative\u201d actions.\n\u201cWe warn the Philippines to stop making any remarks that may lead to the intensification of conflicts and escalation of the situation, and stop all infringing and provocative actions,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\u201cIf the Philippines repeatedly challenges China\u2019s bottom line, China will continue to take firm and decisive measures to firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,\u201d it added.
