It challenges the entire global order promoted by the United States and its allies, and it strengthens the hand of those countries around the world which seek to overturn the US-led post-Cold War international system.\nIn particular, it strikes a direct blow at America's position in Asia and strengthens China's bid to take its place as the leading regional power."}
