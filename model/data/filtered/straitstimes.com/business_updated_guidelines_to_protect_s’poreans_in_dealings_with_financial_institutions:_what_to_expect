Fair dealing should be demonstrated across all activities that impact the customer, from product design to post-sales service. We look forward to financial institutions implementing these guidelines robustly,\u201d she said.\nExplaining the rationale of the guidelines, MAS said the way FIs manufacture, select, market and distribute financial products and services affects their customers\u2019 financial decisions.\n\u201cFinancial institutions should therefore ensure that their business functions are cognisant of the influence on customers\u2019 decisions, and have a strong emphasis on fair dealing in their corporate culture.\u201d\nFIs should duly consider the needs and interests of customers, and act accordingly throughout every aspect of their business to achieve this, from product design and governance, to marketing and sales, and in the provision of after-sales services and complaints handling, it noted.\nMeanwhile, the board and senior management of FIs should set the culture for their FIs, determine risk appetites and put in place governance structures, policies and processes, the central bank said.\nMAS expects FIs to ensure customers feel they are dealing with institutions where fair dealing is central to the corporate culture, and they are being offered products and services that are suitable for them.\nIt also expects FIs to ensure their customers are served by competent representatives, they receive clear, relevant and timely information that accurately represents the products and services offered and delivered, and that customer complaints are handled in an independent, effective and prompt manner.\nSingapore banks welcomed the updated guidelines.\nMs Jacquelyn Tan, who heads UOB\u2019s personal financial services group, said the bank will continue to safeguard the needs and interests of its customers.\n\u201cUOB prioritises the customer\u2019s understanding of the risks associated with any investment over any potential returns. The guidelines align with our consistent objective of ensuring that financial products and services offered to customers are suitable for their unique needs and profiles, taking into account their background, risk appetites and other factors,\u201d she told The Straits Times.\nMs Loretta Yuen, head of legal and compliance at OCBC, said fair dealing has always been a core part of the bank\u2019s culture.\n\u201cWe therefore welcome the updated guidelines... as it formalises what we believe in and what we have already been putting into practice \u2013 acting with integrity, transparency and doing what is right for all customers,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis includes providing clear, relevant and timely information so that they can make informed decisions, recommending products that are aligned with their objectives and risk profiles, and deepening our employees\u2019 knowledge so they can give the most appropriate advice.\u201d\nMr Lam Chee Kin, group head of legal and compliance at DBS Bank, said the bank stands behind the updated guidelines.\n\u201cToday, fair dealing is already the foundation of our business and is embedded in everything we do. This includes communicating with our customers in a clear and transparent manner, understanding our customers\u2019 risk profile, and ensuring the suitability of products and services,\u201d he said."}
