Japan is also home to several private-sector space start-ups, and Jaxa aims to send an astronaut to the moon as part of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Artemis programme in the next few years.\nBut the Japanese space agency has recently faced multiple setbacks in rocket development, including the launch failure in March 2023 of its new flagship rocket, H3.\nThe failure caused widespread delays in Japan\u2019s space missions, including Slim and a joint lunar exploration with India, which in August made a historic touchdown on the Moon\u2019s south pole.\nJaxa has twice landed on small asteroids, but a moon landing is much more difficult because of gravity. Three lunar missions by Japanese start-up ispace, Russia\u2019s space agency and American company Astrobotic have failed in the past year.\nOnly four nations \u2013 the former Soviet Union, the United States, China and India \u2013 have achieved a soft landing on the Moon\u2019s surface.\nSlim\u2019s successful touchdown and demonstration of the precision landing \u201cwill help Japan to keep its technology advanced at a very high level in the world\u201d, Ritsumeikan University professor Kazuto Saiki said.\nProf Saiki developed Slim\u2019s near-infrared camera that will analyse moon rocks after the touchdown.\n\u201cMistakes happen, but Japan is a very experienced space power \u2013 it\u2019s conducted very complicated space operations for many years,\u201d said Dr Bleddyn Bowen, a University of Leicester associate professor specialising in space policy.\n\u201cNot as big as the United States or the Soviet Union of old or China today in terms of scale, but in terms of capability and niche advanced technologies, Japan has always been there.\u201d\nSlim\u2019s precision landing \u201cwon\u2019t be a game changer\u201d, but the demonstration of it and the lightweight probe manufacturing Japan has pursued might open up moonshots to space organisations worldwide by reducing the cost of each mission, Dr Bowen added.\nOn landing, Slim will also deploy two mini-probes \u2013 a hopping vehicle as big as a microwave oven and a baseball-sized wheeled rover \u2013 that will take pictures of the spacecraft.\nTech giant Sony Group, toy-maker Tomy and several Japanese universities jointly developed the robots.
