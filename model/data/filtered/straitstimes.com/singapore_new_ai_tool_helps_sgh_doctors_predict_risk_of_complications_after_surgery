SGH did not provide a figure for its post-operative complications.\nPreviously, its anaesthetists and surgeons had to run through a patient\u2019s medical records themselves to determine the chance of complications after surgery. This could lead to less accurate risk assessments if there is an oversight.\nWith CARES-ML, human error is reduced. It can predict the risk of a patient requiring intensive care or dying within 30 days of surgery with an accuracy of over 90 per cent and 80 per cent respectively.\nIt is also able to flag the factors that increase risk, such as body mass index and type of anaesthesia used. This helps doctors to understand the reasons behind the AI-generated risk level. The information also means doctors can better anticipate problems that arise from surgery and improve patient outcomes.\nThey may choose to postpone the operation, for instance, or suggest a prehabilitation programme for patients before the procedure.\nWith a more accurate gauge of a patient\u2019s needs after surgery, SGH can also allocate its resources more effectively, such as prioritising which patients should be given a space in the intensive care unit.\nThe AI tool is being used in all surgical risk assessments at the hospital, including for high-risk and major operations such as total knee replacement and colorectal cancer surgery.\nAssociate Professor Hairil Rizal, senior consultant of anaesthesiology, said that CARES-ML serves as a support for doctors, rather than a substitute.\n\u201cMachine learning, and any AI model, helps in terms of providing clinicians with a second opinion. It supports the clinician by looking at more data points than a human clinician can.\u201d\nDoctors are still able to change the predicted risk level based on their experience, though this cannot deviate from the AI-generated prediction beyond a certain point.\nOn the issue of liability in the event of serious complications, such as death after surgery, Prof Hairil assured patients that doctors are always involved in the decision-making process. Since they are the ones determining the patient\u2019s risk level and necessary care, the doctors are still responsible for patient outcomes.\nThe team of anaesthetists, surgeons and biostatisticians behind CARES-ML are looking to expand their existing model to predict other post-operative outcomes such as length of hospital stay and risk of pneumonia."}
