At the conclusion of the session, Mrs Lee, who is in her 50s, announced to thunderous applause: \u201cThe ship has reached the shore.\u201d\nSingapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at the conclusion of the talks in March 2023 that Mrs Lee\u2019s leadership had \u201cenabled parties to bridge differences and arrive at an ambitious and future-proof BBNJ Agreement\u201d.\nTime magazine said: \u201cImagine navigating negotiations for a legal framework governing human activities over and under about half of the world.\n\u201cThat has been the challenge facing Rena Lee... the president of a UN intergovernmental conference on marine biodiversity, during five years of turbulent discussions over efforts to safeguard life in the high seas.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a woman with a will of steel,\u201d said Professor Peter Ng, who was technical adviser to the Singapore delegation during the BBNJ proceedings.\n\u201cWith scientists, leaders and ambassadors from over 100 countries, all with their own interests, actively arguing their cases, the whole exercise can be very chaotic. Getting a general consensus appears almost impossible,\u201d he said.\nBut with her \u201csoft-spoken and very firm style\u201d, Mrs Lee was able to command the respect of the room and keep things in order.\nA \u201cperfect diplomat\u201d, Prof Ng called her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just talk; she gets things done.\u201d\nHe added that even after all the proceedings and disagreements, most of the delegates still had \u201cimmense respect\u201d for her. \u201cThat is something I don\u2019t always see. It\u2019s easy to see why they honoured her as such.\u201d\nThe treaty, which was adopted by the UN in June 2023, helps pave the way for the establishment of marine protected areas in the high seas. The high seas refer to international waters, located more than 200 nautical miles from any coastline.\nWhen the new treaty comes into force after it is formally adopted, signed and ratified by enough countries, it will allow the creation of marine protected areas in these international waters. It will enter into force after 60 countries ratify the treaty. To date, only four nations \u2013 Palau, Chile, Belize and Seychelles \u2013 have done so.\nOthers who made Time\u2019s list include China\u2019s Premier Li Qiang and Iranian journalist and human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023."}
