The administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the President\u2019s desk.\u201d\nA bipartisan 316-94 House majority on April 19 voted to advance the Bill to a vote, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told senators to be ready to work over the weekend if it passes the House as expected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the perfect legislation, it\u2019s not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate and the White House,\u201d Mr Johnson told reporters on April 19.\n\u201cThis is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances to take care of these really important obligations.\u201d\nSome hardline Republicans have voiced strong opposition to further Ukraine aid, with some arguing the US can ill afford it given its rising US$34 trillion national debt.\nThey have repeatedly raised the threat of ousting Mr Johnson, who became Speaker in October 2023 after his predecessor Kevin McCarthy was ousted by party hardliners.\nRepresentative Bob Good, chair of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told reporters on April 19 that the Bills represent a \u201cslide down into the abyss of greater fiscal crisis and America-last policies that reflect Biden and Schumer and (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries, and don\u2019t reflect the American people\u201d.\nBut Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who carries huge influence in the party, on April 12 voiced support for Mr Johnson and in an April 18 social media post said Ukraine\u2019s survival is important for the US.\nThe Bills provide US$60.84 billion to address the conflict in Ukraine, including US$23 billion to replenish US weapons, stocks and facilities; US$26 billion for Israel, including US$9.1 billion for humanitarian needs; and US$8.12 billion for the Indo-Pacific.
