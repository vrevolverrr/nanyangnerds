They just disappeared, and we didn\u2019t hear a word back about any future event or possibility of a refund,\u201d he said.\nMr Goyal searched Facebook, Google and Telegram for others in the same situation. So far, 44 people have come forward to say they could not get their refund.\nStudent Min Khant, 21, who contacted Mr Goyal, said: \u201cAs soon as I realised that the event was cancelled, I tried to get a refund instead of using the redemption code for the other event that has yet to be confirmed.\n\u201cAfter I didn\u2019t get a reply, I assumed that I had been scammed and made a police report.\u201d\nThe police have confirmed that reports have been lodged and that they are looking into the matter.\nResponding to queries by The Straits Times, Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) said D1 Racing booked the space on Siloso Beach in October.\n\u201cUpon being informed of the event\u2019s cancellation, SDC immediately requested the event organiser to inform all ticket holders of the cancellation as they were solely responsible for all marketing, ticket sales and execution of the event,\u201d SDC said.\nRasif said she had pulled out of the event for personal reasons.\nShe told ST that she found out she was one of the featured acts only from D1 Racing\u2019s Facebook advertisement, and that she then asked the organiser for payment and assurance that it had the necessary licences for the event.\nShe added: \u201cWe reminded the organisers that my attendance was not confirmed until we received a deposit and conducted due diligence, and requested they stop using me in ads until then.\n\u201cWe ceased any further negotiations with D1 after realising some inaccuracies in their contract.\u201d\nThe 28-year-old, who is also a social media influencer, said the organiser did not have permission to use pictures of her in its promotion, and was told four times to remove them but did not do so.\nResponding to ST queries, D1 Racing said the event had to be cancelled due to drastic changes.\nIt added that it was \u201cleft stranded and had no choice but to cancel the event\u201d."}
