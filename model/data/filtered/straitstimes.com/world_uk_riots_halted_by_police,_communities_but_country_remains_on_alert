The far-right chants of \u201cstop the boats\u201d was also a slogan of the Conservative Party before it was swept out of power after 14 years at the election.\nOfficials dismissed suggestions the riots were political.\n\u201cAny suggestion they\u2019re patriots, or they\u2019ve got a cause... is nonsense,\u201d Mr Rowley said. \u201cThey\u2019re criminals, and frankly, most of them are going to be charged with violent disorder, and most of them are going to go to prison for a few years.\u201d\nSeveral thousand people from anti-racism groups gathered in Walthamstow, north London, following threats to an immigration advice centre there. Others have protected mosques and hotels housing migrant asylum seekers that were among other targets.\nMr Rowley hailed a \u201csuccessful\u201d night that had gone \u201cvery peacefully\u201d, apart from a few criminal incidents. \u201cI think the show of force from the police, and frankly, the show of unity from communities, together defeated the challenges that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he told reporters.\nOne man was jailed for three years on Aug 7 for violent disorder and punching a police officer, and two others received jail sentences of two years and eight months on Aug 8. The government has also secured hundreds of prison places to jail those engaged in violence.\nFast and tough judicial action was viewed as helping quell the last serious nationwide rioting in England in 2011, for which almost 4,000 people were arrested.\nMr Starmer said the night of Aug 7 was \u201cmuch better than expected\u201d, but he was holding an emergency meeting with police later on Aug 8 to ensure efforts to contain any further riots continue.\n\u201cI was very keen that we\u2019re able to demonstrate that if you\u2019re involved in disorder, within days, you\u2019ll be in the criminal justice system,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat needs to continue.\u201d\nWhile anti-racism protesters marched on Aug 7 carrying banners with slogans like \u201cRefugees Welcome\u201d and \u201cNo to Hate\u201d, no large far-right gatherings were reported.\nBy 9pm (4am Singapore time) there were no reports of any serious disorder. Police said around 50 people in Croydon, south London, had thrown bottles and were trying to cause disruption.\nOne woman who joined a counter-protest in Hastings, south-east England, said she was relieved to see a large turnout.\n\u201cI felt I absolutely had to be here tonight to take a stand, and it is much easier for me to come as a white woman than for some of my non-white friends, so I\u2019m here in solidarity,\u201d said 37-year-old Lucy, a flower grower who declined to give her last name.\nAccording to Logically, a company which works with governments and other organisations to reduce the harm of misinformation, the disorder had been coordinated by an international network of extreme right-wing Telegram channels with links to banned groups.\nFormer members of banned neo-Nazi groups Atomwaffen Division and National Action had joined US-founded Active Club networks of white supremacist groups, neo-Nazis, and those of nationalist soccer hooligans to stoke tension and provoke clashes. They were among the first to share a list of targets, Logically said.\nMany police and even some police dogs have been injured since the start of the rioting, with officers suffering broken limbs and facial fractures.
