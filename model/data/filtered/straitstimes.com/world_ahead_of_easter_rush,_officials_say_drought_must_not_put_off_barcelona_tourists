During your stay, save water\u201d.\nAs the impact of climate change intensifies across southern Europe, Spain\u2019s Mediterranean region of Catalonia, which includes Barcelona, is enduring its worst drought on record.\nReservoir levels are around only 15 per cent of their capacity, prompting curbs on water use by residents, visitors, agriculture and industry.\nBeach showers are shut and swimming pools cannot be filled with tap water, among other restrictions.\nCatalan officials have appealed for tourists to act responsibly, but are also adamant the drought should not put them off from coming to the Spanish city and region most visited by foreigners, where tourism accounts for 14.5 per cent of the local economy.\n\u201cThe message from Catalonia\u2019s tourism agency and business department to campsites and hotels is one of calm: (People) can enjoy their holidays here as usual,\u201d said Mr David Mascort, the regional government\u2019s environmental chief.\nBarcelona\u2019s hotel association warned in February that the city could not afford to project an image abroad of hotels with empty pools.\nHotels\u2019 lobbying prompted the authorities to relax a total ban on filling pools, allowing desalinated water to be used instead.\n\u201cTourists are not scared by the drought and are not aware of it (before arriving),\u201d said hotel association director Manel Casals.\n\u201cIf we are not careful, the image of Barcelona will be impacted (by the drought restrictions) but we are not aware of any negative impact so far. Tourists are still coming.\u201d\nTourists visiting Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi\u2019s Sagrada Familia confirmed they had known nothing of the water restrictions before seeing the billboards.\n\u201cOf course, tourists can expend less water if they are aware of the situation,\u201d Finnish traveller Johan Saltin said.\nBarcelona\u2019s hotels have halved their water use since 2016, according to a recent hotel association study, though five-star hotels still used the most \u2013 242 litres of water per day on average in 2022 \u2013 and all hotels represented 9 per cent of the city\u2019s consumption.\nCurrent water restrictions order residents to use 200 litres only per day.\nTourism over-saturation is prompting protests by some Barcelona residents, and the drought may exacerbate the issue.\nEnvironmental activists held a protest on March 20 at Barcelona\u2019s tourism agency, demanding restrictions for the sector, holding signs that read: \u201cLet\u2019s close the tap to tourism\u201d and \u201cRivers and aquifers without water, hotels\u2019 pools full\u201d.\n\u201cWith the situation we are living, it is indecent that the concern is to (avoid) sending an image of alarm to tourists, when the real problem we have is that our territory is drying up,\u201d said protester Josep Sabate.
