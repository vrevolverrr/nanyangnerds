And then, these started to become \u201cmore mainstream\u201d.\nIn 2011, when he entered politics, DPM Wong said his starting point was to engage different people and hear their ideas and feedback.\nHe added: \u201cThere will be differences, there will be different perspectives, but hopefully we can form a consensus and hopefully your inputs, your perspectives, will enhance decision making. And often, very many times, they do.\u201d\nHe cited the example of a playground in Sembawang, which HDB designed and built in partnership with residents under its Build-a-Playground initiative.\nAbout 1,800 people, including residents and other members of the community such as students from nearby schools, came together to share views on the kind of playground they wanted. About 300 residents took part in workshops to design the playground.\nHe said the sense of fulfilment and ownership residents found through the process was much more than if it had been built through a usual consultation exercise. He opened the playground in 2018 when he was the National Development Minister.\nAnd this experience showed that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot that we can do in taking partnerships forward\u201d, he said.\nThe other two panellists were Mr Larry Yeung, executive director of Participate in Design, a citizen engagement consultancy, and Dr Carol Soon, principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies.\nMr Yeung said one challenge of engaging Singaporeans is that people see engagement as a wish list to ask for what they want. If they do not get what they want, they may dismiss the effort to hear their views.\nHe told The Straits Times that true engagement is more focused on the process of the Government working with people to find solutions, and less focused on outcomes. So there is a need to help Singaporeans understand how engagement works, he said.\nDPM Wong said there is also a need to broaden and deepen partnerships and engagements with Singaporeans in the days ahead.\nOn the Government\u2019s part, Mr Tong noted, a mindset shift is needed. For example, an idea that was suggested may not work today, but this does not mean it will never work. He suggested that the Government tweak the idea or put it aside until society is ready for its implementation, instead of rejecting it outright.\nMs Lin Shiyun, founder of 3Pumpkins, shared how she started the charity at one presentation during the SGPO launch.\nMs Lin, a former arts producer, started one of the charity\u2019s programmes, the Tak Takut Kids Club, after spending three years at playgrounds interacting with children from low-income families.\n\u201cI feel the kids want a sense of belonging. Some of them don\u2019t have good relationships at home,\u201d she said, adding that meeting this need for belonging could help these children break from negative influences they may experience at home.\nIn 2019, she started the club in a shop in Boon Lay, which offers arts-based and other activities where the children could also make friends.\nShe said: \u201cWith the formation of SGPO, we are looking at how to deepen partnerships and to build a better safety net for the kids.\u201d"}
