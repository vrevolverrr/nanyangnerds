Sithambaram said Najib\u2019s lawyers had at the hearing in Aug 2022 maintained a \u201cblind confidence\u201d that their application for additional evidence and adjournment would be allowed by the Federal Court, and were unprepared for legal argument when the appeal hearing proceeded instead.\n\u201cThere was no breach of natural justice by the refusal of adjournment as it is self-inflicted. There was no \u2018Plan B\u2019 in the event the court did not allow the adjournment. Najib\u2019s then lead counsel Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik and Zist treated the whole appeals complacently and expected that they would be entitled to an adjournment despite the clear instruction from the top court that the main appeal would proceed,\u201d Datuk Sithambaram said, referring to law firm Messrs Zaid Ibrahim Suflan TH Liew & Partners (Zist).\nMr Sithambaram was making submissions at the hearing for Najib\u2019s application to review the court decision that confirmed his conviction and 12 years\u2019 jail sentence for misappropriating RM42 million (S$12.9 million) belonging to former 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) subsidiary SRC International, claiming that he was not given a fair hearing.\nThe prosecutor said that after the adjournment was refused, Najib\u2019s defence team then filed an application to recuse Chief Justice Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat from the panel of judges hearing the appeal.\n\u201cThis was again nothing but another desperate attempt to scuttle the hearing of the appeals,\u201d he added.\nIn August 2022, Mr Hisyam asked for a postponement of three to four months, as he had taken over Najib\u2019s case only several weeks earlier.\nThe request was dismissed by a five-judge panel led by Chief Justice Maimun.\nMr Hisyam then refused to make any submission on Najib\u2019s behalf.\nThe Federal Court subsequently upheld Najib\u2019s conviction and sentence on Aug 23, 2022.\nMr Sithambaram said Mr Hisyam and Zist should not have accepted the case when hearing dates were already fixed, unless they were prepared to proceed with the appeal.\nHe added that Najib\u2019s move to switch counsel midway was a strategic move to adjourn the appeal hearing.\n\u201cNajib had four months to engage solicitors and prepare the case if he indeed wanted to change his existing solicitors and counsel. Discharging his long-time counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah from Messrs Shafee & Co was a strategic move to adjourn the appeal,\u201d he said.\nNajib is also seeking a review of the court\u2019s decision to dismiss his attempt to postpone his appeal hearing, as well as its decision not to recuse Tun Tengku Maimun from the Federal Court appeal due to Facebook posts made by her husband in May 2018.\nThe latter had allegedly demonstrated negative views of Najib\u2019s leadership and had concluded that he had siphoned funds from 1MDB into his personal bank account.\nIn addition, Najib is attempting to nullify his hearing in the High Court on the basis of trial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali not recusing himself over an alleged conflict of interest.\nOn Jan 4, Najib petitioned the United Nations Human Rights Council\u2019s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to rule that the dismissal of his appeal by the Federal Court in August 2022 was unjust and flawed as he \u201cwas sent to jail without the opportunity to defend himself\u201d.\nHis legal team had said that a failure to give a new set of lawyers more time to prepare \u2013 after being appointed three weeks before the appeal in the federal court \u2013 had unjustly punished Najib.\nThe hearing continues next Monday."}
