The same applies to post-secondary school students applying for the youth empowerment and aspiration programme grant.\nAt an annual CDAC family-bonding event held at Nanyang Junior College, CDAC board member Alex Yam said that this move aims to help as many families as possible and match current national income levels, following changes in various support schemes at the national level.\nThis periodic review ensures CDAC identifies gaps that it can help beneficiaries with, said Mr Yam.\nOn the scale and timing of the revision, he said: \u201cLargely, we\u2019re looking at our beneficiary base, as well as income changes in the population.\n\u201cWe are also keeping a close track of other agencies, especially in the public sector and other self-help groups, on how they have reviewed their own income criteria.\u201d\nMr Yam added: \u201cIncomes have grown, so we want to be able to support those families that we also used to support\u2026 Because many of those that require assistance have experienced a growth in their incomes.\u201d\nDeputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who was the guest of honour at the event, interacted with some of the 1,500 family beneficiaries who participated in the carnival activities.\nInitially, Madam Fong was worried that her daughters, Chen Yi Yuan, 12, and Chen Yi Xin, 13, would no longer qualify for CDAC\u2019s bursaries, since the family\u2019s new gross monthly household income exceeded the current income ceiling of $2,400 with the additional income from her second job.\nBut with the new income ceiling, her daughters can continue to get bursaries of $480 each in 2024 when they progress to Secondary 1 and 2, respectively.\nMadam Fong first applied for the bursaries in 2022 as she found it tough to handle all the expenses.\nHer 68-year-old mother\u2019s nursing home expenses are about $600 to $800 every month.\n\u201cI deposit the bursaries into my daughters\u2019 bank accounts. I use these funds only whenever they need to buy something new for school,\u201d Madam Fong told The Straits Times in Mandarin."}
