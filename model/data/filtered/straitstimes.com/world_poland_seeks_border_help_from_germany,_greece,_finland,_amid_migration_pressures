Especially, for example, Greek experiences can be very useful,\" a senior government official told reporters.\nThe border between Poland and Belarus has become a flashpoint as Western officials accuse the government in Minsk of using migrants it brings in from outside of Europe as \"hybrid warfare\".\nThe European Union's border agency, Frontex, says the number of people trying to cross into the EU along the bloc's eastern border has nearly doubled in the first five months of 2024, although the route remains relatively small compared with other ways into Europe.\nOfficials in Poland and Finland have warned in recent months that the number of people trying to cross via Belarus or Russia could rise significantly in the near term.\nGreece is extending its fencing on its border with Turkey, while Finland seeks to close a new migrant route via Russia to Europe by deploying more border guard patrols, drones and electronic detectors and by building fences.\nPolish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in an interview with public television on July 4 that migrants coming through from Belarus might include people trained to attack Polish soldiers.\nWarsaw's centrist government hopes to raise the issue at the upcoming Nato summit in Washington next week.\nEarlier this week, Germany and Poland presented a joint action plan in which they agreed to discuss boosting defence cooperation, including a stronger Nato presence on the alliance's eastern border, and the coordination of Ukraine aid.
