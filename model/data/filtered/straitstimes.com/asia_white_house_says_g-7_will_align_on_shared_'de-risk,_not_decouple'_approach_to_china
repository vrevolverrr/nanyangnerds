It is not hostile or gratuitous. It is just direct and candid,\u201d Mr Sullivan said, adding that the statement emerged after intensive consultations with G-7 partners in recent years.\nHe said the United States expected economic engagement to continue with China, but was still working through the timing regarding planned phone calls, visits and meetings for various administration officials with their Chinese counterparts.\nIn an early draft of the final communique, seen by Reuters, G-7 leaders agreed that China\u2019s status as the world\u2019s second-largest economy necessitated efforts to foster cooperation.\n\u201cOur policy approaches are not designed to harm China, we do not seek to thwart China\u2019s economic progress and development,\u201d said the draft, which is still subject to change, calling for \u201cstable and constructive\u201d ties with Beijing.\nMr Sullivan said G-7 leaders would outline a common set of tools to address economic coercion, including steps to build more resilient supply chains and efforts to protect sensitive technologies through export controls and outbound investment measures.\nEach country would determine its own approach, he said.\nThe US had been working to develop the legal authorities for a targeted set of outbound investment controls and would lay out its approach after \u201cfull consultations\u201d with G-7 partners, Mr Sullivan said.
