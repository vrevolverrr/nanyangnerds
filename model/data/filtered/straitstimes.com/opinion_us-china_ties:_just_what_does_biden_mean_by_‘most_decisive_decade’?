By accident or design, without firing a shot or losing a single American life, the US has lured Russian President Vladimir Putin into doing incalculable harm to his nation in potentially lasting ways. For about US$15 billion (S$21.3 billion) in arms shipped to Kyiv, Ukrainians \u2013 who have probably surprised themselves with their own resilience and emerged as a true nation regardless of whatever Moscow might think of it \u2013 have sacrificed thousands of lives, and may even prevail in the war with Russia.\nKey European states, starting with its pre-eminent economic power, Germany, have been galvanised into opening their treasuries to significantly boost defence spending and, as winter approaches, will be visibly trading income and warmth as they turn away from critical gas supplied by Russia. Europe\u2019s biggest economy is currently enduring the worst inflation since the founding of the Federal Republic."}
