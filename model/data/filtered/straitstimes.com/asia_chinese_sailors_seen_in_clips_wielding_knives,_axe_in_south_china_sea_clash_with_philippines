A second man can also be seen stabbing the boat with a knife.\nThe Philippine military claimed an axe-wielding sailor had \u201cthreatened to injure\u201d a Filipino soldier, while others were \u201cexplicitly threatening to harm\u201d Filipino troops.\n\u201cThe (Chinese coast guard) personnel then began hurling rocks and other objects at our personnel,\u201d Manila said. \u201cThey also slashed the (inflatable boats), rendering them inoperable.\u201d\nThe Filipino sailors, wearing brown camouflage with helmets and vests, are not carrying weapons in the clips.\n\u201cAmidst this violent confrontation, the CCG (Chinese coast guard) also deployed tear gas, intensifying the chaos and confusion, while continuously blaring sirens to further disrupt communication,\u201d the caption says.\nManila has accused Beijing of an \u201cact of piracy\u201d against its forces.\nIt has also demanded the return of items \u201clooted\u201d by the Chinese side, including seven guns, and reparations for damaged equipment.\n\u2018Perilous\u2019 situation\nAnalysts say Beijing is escalating confrontations with the Philippines in a bid to push it out of the South China Sea.\nMr Jay Batongbacal, director for the Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea in Manila, told AFP that China\u2019s forces could be poised to seize the grounded Philippine warship, the Sierra Madre.\n\u201cThe deployment of their forces at present around the Sierra Madre and then the many reefs around the Kalayaan island group is indicative that they\u2019re ready to do it,\u201d he said, referring to Manila-claimed areas in the Spratly Islands.\nThe US has said that \u201can armed attack\u201d against Philippine public vessels, aircraft, armed forces and coast guard anywhere in the South China Sea would require it to come to Manila\u2019s defence under a treaty between the two countries.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u201cemphasised that (China\u2019s) actions undermine regional peace and stability\u201d in a call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique Manalo on June 19, according to the US State Department.\nThey also \u201cunderscored the United States\u2019 ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defence Treaty\u201d, Mr Blinken said.\nAnother analyst told AFP this week\u2019s clashes \u201cbrought us perilously close\u201d to a situation in which the US would be required to intervene militarily.\n\u201cThe Philippines will likely need to continue resupply missions to the Sierra Madre, one way or another,\u201d said Mr Duan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst.\n\u201cBacking down and accepting Beijing\u2019s terms regarding these operations would mean relinquishing sovereign rights within its exclusive economic zone,\u201d he said.
