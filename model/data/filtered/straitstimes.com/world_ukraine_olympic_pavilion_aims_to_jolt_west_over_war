It is a gritty celebration of Ukrainian national identity and the fighting spirit and ingenuity of its people, both on the battlefield and in sport.\nThere is the homemade barbell made from a pipe and two tyres like the one high jumper Andriy Protsenko used to train with when Russian troops occupied his home region of Kherson in the south.\nA mockup of the Donetsk airport, a symbol of Ukraine\u2019s resistance, is also on display.\nThe world\u2019s biggest sporting competition is taking place as Russia\u2019s invasion stretches into its third year, making a mockery of the idea of an Olympic truce.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s troops are slowly advancing in the east while Kyiv\u2019s forces are outgunned and exhausted.\nWith 140 athletes competing for medals, the Games are a chance for Ukraine to make sure its fight for survival is not forgotten at a time of waning interest in the West.\nJoy, anger, sorrow\n\u201cI ask you not to forget about Ukraine,\u201d Sports Minister Matviy Bidnyi pleaded at the pavilion\u2019s opening at the weekend.\nDozens of guests stood up for the Ukrainian national anthem and observed a moment of silence, with French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera and World Athletics head Sebastian Coe pledging continued support.\nBut despite the promises of aid, it is becoming harder for Ukraine to make its voice heard, especially at a time of fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East.\nThe programme at Ukraine House offers a rollercoaster of emotions from anger and sorrow to pride and joy as organisers seek to pull at people\u2019s heartstrings.\nThe country\u2019s athletes including star tennis player Elina Svitolina and Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who has just set a new world record in the women\u2019s high jump, are scheduled to drop by for interviews.\nVisitors will also get the chance to learn how to cook borscht, Ukraine\u2019s iconic beetroot soup, but also an opportunity to watch 20 Days In Mariupol, a harrowing documentary which won the best documentary Oscar in March.\nSinger Jamala, who won the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest, said countries of \u201cthe first world\u201d needed to see that \u201cdisgusting things\u201d are continuing to happen to Ukraine.\n\u201cOK, it\u2019s not fresh news, but we still need your help,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOur kids are dying every day. Our men are dying. Our women get raped.\u201d\n\u2018Look at this\u2019\nNext week, the pavilion will welcome two children injured in the war \u2013 eight-year-old gymnast Oleksandra Paskal and runner Yana Stepanenko, 13.\nOleksandra lost her leg in a Russian attack on the southern region of Odesa two years ago. But after undergoing rehabilitation she continues to train and compete.\nYana, who lost both her lower legs in a Russian attack on the Kramatorsk train station, ran five kilometres on prosthetics in the Boston Marathon in 2023.\n\u201cYou should look at this,\u201d Sports Minister Mr Bidnyi told AFP.\n\u201cTomorrow, this can come to your country.\u201d\nThe 44-year-old said it was hard for people to understand what Ukrainians were going through. \u201cIt\u2019s a different planet,\u201d he said.\nIn early July, Mr Bidnyi\u2019s wife lost her 20-year-old cousin as Russia struck a business centre and a leading children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv, among other sites.\n\u201cI found her headless body,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPeople should not be seeing things like this.\u201d\nThe July 8 Russian strikes on Kyiv killed 33 people including five children and left more than 120 injured.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky skipped the Olympic opening ceremony in Paris and is not expected to attend the Games which close on Aug 11.\nAs the Olympics got under way, Mr Zelensky and his wife Olena visited young patients at the devastated Kyiv hospital."}
