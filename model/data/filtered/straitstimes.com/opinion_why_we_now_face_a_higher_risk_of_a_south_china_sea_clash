His prepared keynote speech began with a bold declaration of his country\u2019s determination to defend its claims in the South China Sea against Chinese pressure. Then, in answering a blunt question from the audience, he did not shy away from what that might mean.\nHe was asked about a scenario in which Chinese Coast Guard water cannon killed a Filipino sailor in a South China Sea clash, and \u201cwould that cross a red line\u201d leading Manila to invoke its mutual defence treaty with Washington and \u2013 by clear implication \u2013 lead to war. His response was blunt. \u201cOnce we get to that point,\u201d he replied, \u201ccertainly we would have crossed the Rubicon\u2026 Almost certainly it\u2019s going to be a red line.\u201d"}
