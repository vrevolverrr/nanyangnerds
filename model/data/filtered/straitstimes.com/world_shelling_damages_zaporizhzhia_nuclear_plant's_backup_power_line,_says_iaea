Russian forces took over the plant soon after their Feb 24 invasion of Ukraine but Ukrainian technicians still operate the power station.\nAnother of the backup lines was disconnected earlier this week to extinguish a fire.\nZaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine has six reactors and is Europe's biggest nuclear power plant.\nUkraine said on Wednesday it might have to shut down the plant to avoid a disaster and called on residents in areas nearby to evacuate for their own safety.\n\"While the plant also has emergency diesel generators available if needed, IAEA director-general Grossi has repeatedly expressed concern about the power supply situation,\"the agency said.
