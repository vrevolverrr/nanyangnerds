That 62 per cent pace would be faster than Hong Kong's estimated 60 per cent for the same period, but slower than the growth forecast in mainland China, India, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan.\nSingapore's millionaire density - or percentage of millionaires in the total population - was 5.5 per cent in 2020, the second-highest in Asia after Hong Kong's 8.3 per cent, the report said.\nThe Republic's Gini coefficient - a more broad-based measure of wealth inequality - was at 78.3 in 2020, much higher than Japan's 64.4, South Korea's 67.6 and Taiwan's 70.8.\nThe wealth share of the top 1 per cent in Singapore was almost 34 per cent at the end of 2020, compared with 18 per cent in Japan, 24 per cent in South Korea and 28 per cent in Taiwan.\nIn a small country like Singapore, higher wealth inequality can result from an unrepresentative cluster of very high net-worth individuals, the report said.\nGlobally, Singapore ranked 11th in terms of millionaire density, with about 1,361 ultra-high-net-worth adults with net worth exceeding US$50 million (S$67 million) in 2020.\nTotal wealth in Singapore grew to US$1.6 trillion last year, up from US$1.5 trillion in 2019.\nEven in the midst of a pandemic, the world gained 5.2 million millionaires last year as the rich cashed in on surging stock and house prices.\nThe report highlighted the contrasting fortunes at the top and the bottom, as those on lower earnings suffered job losses and a drop in income due to the pandemic's economic fallout.\nTotal global wealth grew by 7.4 per cent to US$418 trillion last year, and wealth per adult rose by 6 per cent to reach another record high of US$79,952. Widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1 per cent, and wealth per adult by 2.7 per cent.\nThe pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimated that US$17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4 per cent, but this was largely reversed by the end of June last year.\nIn the second half of 2020 share prices rallied, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefited from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that US$28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.\nOverall, the Asia-Pacific region housed 15.6 million millionaires in 2020 and this number is expected to increase 71 per cent to about 26.7 million in 2025.\n\u2022 With additional information from The Straits Times"}
