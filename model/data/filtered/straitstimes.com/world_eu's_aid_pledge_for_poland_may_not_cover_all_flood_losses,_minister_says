It does not mean at all that it is an amount sufficient to cover all the losses.\"\nDomanski declined answer questions on how much of the total damage the EU's pledged funds - worth some 0.6% of Poland's 2024 economic output - would cover.\n\"I'm not sure. The damage assessment is ongoing,\" he said.\nIn 1997, massive flooding devastated south-western Poland, causing some 12 billion zlotys in damage, or 34 billion zlotys in today's prices.\nInfrastructure development in the past three decades has increased the scale of damage in the affected area, Polish economist Slawomir Dudek wrote on social media platform X earlier this week.\nHe said Poland might be forced to amend its 2024 budget once the final cost of the deluge emerges.\nPoland, which forecasts its general government deficit at 5.7% of gross domestic product in 2024 and 5.5% in 2025, has been tasked by Brussels with reducing the shortfall to the bloc's 3% limit in the coming years.\nDomanski has previously signalled he was in favour of a four-year deficit reduction path.\n\"I will fight for this path of fiscal adjustment, that is limiting the deficit in the coming years, to be as gentle as possible, adapted to the exceptional situation in which Poland finds itself,\" he said.\nWarsaw has cited increased defence spending following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic and energy price shocks in recent years, as the main cause for its elevated deficit levels.
