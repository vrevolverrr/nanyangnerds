China\u2019s government denies interference in US elections and calls such claims \u201cmalicious speculation\u201d.\nUS support for Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims as its territory, is a longstanding source of friction in US-China relations.\nThe intelligence community had not yet observed Iran seeking to influence state or congressional races, but did assess its aim was to push voters towards supporting US Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate.\nThat view had not changed since September when US officials also said Russia sought to denigrate Ms Harris in favour of Donald Trump.\nCountries would seek to \u201claunder their narratives\u201d through witting and unwitting American voices and stoke divisions in society on issues such as immigration, abortion and gender rights, the official said.\nCuba was also likely targeting Latino and Spanish-speaking voters on social media, aiming to promote candidates it thought would be favourable to its interests.\nIntelligence officials said they had delivered three times the number of \u201cdefensive briefings\u201d to candidates, campaigns and election officials about influence operations, compared to prior election cycles, including on efforts by Russia, China and Iran.\nBut they said US voting systems and election workers were the most prepared they have ever been.\nAn official with the Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency said the US has election infrastructure that is \u201cmore secure than any prior election cycle, and we do believe the election community is more prepared for the incidents that may arise than any prior cycle\u201d.
