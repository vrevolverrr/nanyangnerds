{"title": "Forum: Let\u2019s build a supportive environment which values children", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2024-07-12", "content": "We refer to the letters by Mr Loh Kin Poh (A need to come together to find a solution to low fertility rate, July 2) and Mr Andrew Tan Kok Chua (Have effective strategies to tackle trend of singlehood and couples not wanting children, July 5).\nWe agree with both writers on the critical need to support marriage and parenthood. Our falling fertility rate is an existential issue for Singapore, with serious implications for our economy and society. This is why supporting Singaporeans in starting and raising families remains a top priority for the Government.\nBased on our surveys and engagements, many Singaporeans still aspire to get married and have children. We are committed to helping them realise these aspirations, and have put in place a comprehensive suite of measures, ranging from support for housing and healthcare to pre-school and education.\nMany Singaporeans have cited the cost of raising children and difficulty in managing work and family commitments as key challenges in parenthood.\nWe enhanced the Baby Bonus Scheme and parental leave provisions last year to strengthen financial support and caregiving support for parents. In addition, we recently launched a set of Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement (FWA) Requests, which parents can use if they need to formally request FWAs to manage their caregiving needs alongside work. We are also actively exploring how to further increase parental leave to better support working parents.\nThe decision to have children is deeply personal and we agree that it goes beyond financial considerations. Apart from government measures, it is therefore important for Singaporeans to come together to build a supportive environment which values children and families.\nThrough the Families for Life movement, we are working with stakeholders such as community partners, volunteers, social service agencies, employers and businesses to shift mindsets and build a Singapore that is Made for Families."}
