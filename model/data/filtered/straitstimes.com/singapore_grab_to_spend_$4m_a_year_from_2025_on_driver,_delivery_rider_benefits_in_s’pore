These are limited to drivers and delivery riders in the top two tiers of Grab\u2019s rewards system.\nUnder the GrabBenefits programme, which has been around since 2018, Grab already provides benefits like fuel discounts and insurance for prolonged medical leave.\nGrab said the new perks build on these existing benefits, and they are aimed at addressing concerns raised by drivers and riders during recent focus group sessions.\nThese concerns include the rising cost of medicine and physical ailments like backaches that are not typically covered by visits to the doctor.\nGrab, which posted US$2.36 billion (S$3.06 billion) in revenue in 2023, is not the only platform company that offers perks to drivers and delivery workers out of goodwill.\nGojek and foodpanda provide fuel discounts and medical subsidies, among other benefits.\nAt Gojek, all its drivers today can see a GP at a subsidised rate of $12 per consultation, without any limit on the number of visits. Grab offers the same, and its new subsidy of up to $45 per visit for two GP visits a year is in addition to this.\nGojek on Oct 1 also rolled out a new fuel savings programme following requests from its drivers for higher upfront discounts.\nGrab said the improvements to its benefits scheme are meant to complement the new labour protections under the Platform Workers Act. Set to take effect from Jan 1, 2025, the Act provides platform workers with employee-like levels of Central Provident Fund contributions and work injury compensation insurance.\n\u201cSome of these overlap with what we voluntarily provide today, so it makes sense for us to relook our existing benefits,\u201d Grab Singapore managing director Yee Wee Tang said.\nHe noted that the Platform Workers Act covers on-the-job injuries and long-term savings, while Grab\u2019s benefits programme focuses on more immediate needs such as healthcare and daily expenses.\nIt is not clear how much of the $4 million that Grab has set aside each year will be spent on the new perks. The Nasdaq-listed company declined to provide details. It also declined to say how much it currently spends on the existing GrabBenefits scheme.\nMr Li Jianggan, chief executive of venture capital and research firm Momentum Works, believes the latest improvement to Grab\u2019s benefits scheme is a strategy to win the loyalty of workers.\nAs the greater levels of CPF contributions under the Act may lead to a reduction in take-home earnings, some drivers and riders may reconsider whether they want to continue with platform work. Mr Li added: \u201cSince driver supply is always a key issue in Singapore, Grab needs to provide additional benefits to influence them to stay.\u201d\nMr Ariff Salleh, 42, who has been delivering food for Grab since 2019, said the improved benefits that Grab is offering will be a boon to delivery riders like him. \u201cWe are dealing with food, so the (free) flu vaccination is definitely a plus.\u201d"}
