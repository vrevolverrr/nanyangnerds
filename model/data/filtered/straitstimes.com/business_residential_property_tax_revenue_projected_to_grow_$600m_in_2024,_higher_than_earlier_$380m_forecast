Based on the latest data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority, rents for private residential properties grew 8.7 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter.\nProperty taxes are calculated based on AVs, which are revised yearly based on the estimated annual rent if the property was rented out. This also depends on the condition of the property, its age and locational attributes, and general market trends, said Mr Chee.\nAs announced in Budget 2022, property taxes for non-owner-occupied and \u201chigh-value\u201d owner-occupied residential properties will also increase as a form of wealth tax, he noted.\nThe second and final step of the hike took effect from Jan 1, with tax rates growing to between 12 per cent and 36 per cent.\nWhen asked about implementing differential tax rates for retirees with no income, Mr Chee said the Government \u201cwill take a look and see how\u201d it can help not just seniors, but also other families who are facing a large jump in their property taxes."}
