Before departing, the settlers had little in common except the will to escape a mundane of life in Weimer-era Germany and build new lives in an unspoiled paradise.\nEventually, however, the forces of nature and unscrupulous newcomers begin to pit the islanders against one another, and many of them mysteriously disappear.\nAlthough the movie is set in the Galapagos, the island chain made famous by English naturalist Charles Darwin, the movie was shot in Queensland, Australia.\nEnglish actress Vanessa Kirby, known for her roles in TV series The Crown (2016 to 2023) and movie Napoleon (2023), took the role of Dore Strauch, the love interest of German philosopher Friedrich Ritter, played by English actor Jude Law.\nKirby, 36, said the filming of Eden felt a bit like working on the reality TV show Survivor (2000 to present).\n\"It felt really intense, in the wilderness we were in the 100 degree heat in Australia in summer,\" Kirby told Reuters on the red carpet. \"We were sweaty, we were bitten by everything, so it was real.\"\nEven so, everybody bonded on the set.\n\"We got along really well,\" she said. \"Everyone in German accent: Can you imagine that? It was really nice.\"\nGerman-Spanish actor Daniel Bruhl, who plays the idealistic Heinz Wittmer, told Reuters that the moment the cast came together, they were committed to the story.\n\"We knew that we were doing this for Ron. This was his passion project for years,\" Bruhl said of the Oscar-winning director. \"He has a contagious and good energy, and he did the job of casting people from different places. It is a very eclectic mix.\"\nUnlike the characters they portrayed in the film, he said, the cast enjoyed the project and are still in touch with one another. REUTERS"}
