Details about the locations where the offences took place were also redacted from court documents.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Charis Low told the court that the boy was aware that both victims were below 16 years old when he committed the offences.\nThe first victim, who was 14, went to a friend's home to spend the night in February last year and met the boy there.\nShe was resting on a bed when he approached her, unzipped her jeans and sexually penetrated her.\nCourt documents did not state how the offence came to light, but the boy was under investigation when he targeted a 15-year-old girl who was his girlfriend at the time.\nThe second victim had run away from home in late October last year and sought shelter at the boy's home.\nThey were sleeping together on the same bed and had unprotected sex. The girl became pregnant.\nOn Monday, District Judge May Mesenas called for reports to assess the boy's suitability for probation and reformative training.\nOffenders sentenced to the latter will be detained in a centre and made to follow a strict regimen that includes foot drills and counselling.\nHe will be sentenced on July 5.\nAn offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for sexually penetrating a minor."}
