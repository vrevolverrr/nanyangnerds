Across the command post, all (the) battle staff have been using the new modules liberally,\u201d he said.\nOne of the CCIS\u2019 new modules gives the system the capability to recommend solutions for tackling multiple targets.\nAs information streams back to the command post from various assets, the system can now digest the data and provide the best course of action to take down multiple threats.\nIn the demonstration shown to the media, the CCIS recommended two possible assets to handle two targets that popped up on the screen. The mission commanders eventually decided to have one of the Singapore Army\u2019s High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems deal with one threat and leave the other to a fighter jet. The deciding factor was the assets\u2019 relative distance from the targets.\nBut rather than taking the CCIS\u2019 recommendations as gospel, the final say remains in the hands of the commander, said Lieutenant-Colonel Ray Lee of the RSAF, adding that the CCIS is not meant to remove humans completely from the decision-making process.\nLTC Lee, 44, one of the mission commanders for Exercise Forging Sabre, said the information put up on the CCIS allows for faster and better-informed decisions.\n\u201cUltimately, the commander will make his own decision based on the recommendation... For our kind of operations, it\u2019s very difficult to leave it to a computer to decide whether to strike or not,\u201d he said.\nFor instance, the CCIS can now map out how to minimise collateral damage. The system can estimate the impact that different weapons can cause in specific areas, which Capt Lau described as being \u201cvery important\u201d.\n\u201c(It) allows us at a quick glance to understand the impact of our operations on the vicinity of where we\u2019re working on,\u201d he said, explaining that the module takes nearby buildings into account."}
