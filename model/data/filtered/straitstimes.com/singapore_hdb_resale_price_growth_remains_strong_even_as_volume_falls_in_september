Three-room unit resale transactions came in slightly higher at 25.8 per cent compared with five-room units, which constituted 24.5 per cent of the month\u2019s volume.\nMr Lim attributed the 14.9 per cent month-on-month resale volume decrease \u201cin a small part\u201d to the latest cooling measures that saw the loan-to-value ratio for HDB loans lowered by 5 percentage points from Aug 20.\nOrangeTee Group\u2019s chief researcher and strategist Christine Sun said the resale housing market will continue to face competition in October 2024 as a \u201csubstantial\u201d number of flats will be put up for sale in HDB\u2019s upcoming Build-To-Order (BTO) launch.\n\u201cMany prospective buyers are likely to be drawn to the new BTO flats, especially since this will be the inaugural launch of the Plus flats, and singles can purchase new BTO flats outside non-mature estates,\u201d she noted.\nMs Sun is also of the view that the new flats \u2013 particularly those that come with shorter waiting times \u2013 will provide individuals \u201cin urgent need of housing\u201d with an alternative option to relying exclusively on completed flats available in the secondary market.\n\u201cIf more such flats with shorter waiting times continue to be released in future BTO launches, resale demand and prices may be impacted. Resale price growth may also slow down in the longer term,\u201d she added.\nHuttons Asia chief executive Mark Yip, however, said the latest cooling measures were unlikely to be the reason as he estimates it takes around two months for the measures\u2019 submission to \u201creach acceptance\u201d in HDB\u2019s system.\n\u201cThe lower volume is probably due to lower supply of homes for sale. With supply constrained, transaction volume is lower. Sellers were aware of their stronger bargaining power and held on to their asking prices. In the process, buyers had to pay higher prices and HDB resale prices in September 2024 increased at a faster pace of 1.8 per cent,\u201d he said.\nHe expects demand to remain strong for the year due to lower interest rates, which would, in his view, lower borrowing costs and translate to a higher loan quantum.\n\u201cThis may afford buyers the ability to look at HDB resale flats in better locations. Prices may increase as a result in the coming months,\u201d added Mr Yip.\nHuttons is now forecasting the HDB resale volume for 2024 to range between 29,000 and 30,000, up from its earlier estimate of 26,000 to 28,000. The real estate agency is expecting resale price growth for the year to come in at between 8 per cent and 10 per cent.\nThere were 106 HDB flats resold for at least $1 million in September 2024, compared with the prior month\u2019s 105.\nThe number of million-dollar flats sold comprised 4.8 per cent of the total resale volume for the month, with 20 such units recorded in Kallang Whampoa alone.\nOther notable areas with million-dollar transactions included Queenstown (13 units), Bukit Merah and Toa Payoh (12 units each).\nMs Wong highlighted that the proportion of sales ranging from $800,000 to $1 million \u201cseemed to have stabilised\u201d during the month, in contrast to the uptick in proportion of sales from the $600,000-$700,000 and $700,000-$800,000 price bands.\nMr Yip said: \u201cWith three more months to go in 2024, the number of million-dollar flats is likely to exceed 1,000 and reach 3 per cent to 4 per cent of total market volume.\u201d\nLikewise, Mogul.sg\u2019s chief research officer Nicholas Mak estimates about 990 to 1,000 million-dollar flats could be sold in 2024 to set a new record for the public housing resale market.\nMr Mak said: \u201cSome of the buyers of these million-dollar flats feel that with a budget of $1 million to $1.5 million, they could get more value for their money by buying HDB resale flats that are larger and located on higher floors than condominium units at that price range.\u201d THE BUSINESS TIMES"}
