Many areas remained submerged, preventing stranded people from accessing healthcare facilities.\n\u201cWater is everywhere but there is no clean water to drink. People are getting sick,\u201d said Mr Farid Ahmed, a resident of one of the worst-hit districts, Lakshmipur.\nVast areas of land are submerged, posing a significant threat to crops, Agriculture Ministry officials said.\nThe UN children\u2019s agency Unicef has warned that two million children are at risk as the worst floods in three decades sweep through eastern Bangladesh. The organisation is urgently appealing for US$35 million (S$45.7 million) to provide life-saving supplies.\n\u201cThe devastating floods in eastern Bangladesh are a tragic reminder of the relentless impact of extreme weather events and the climate crisis on children,\u201d said Ms Emma Brigham, deputy representative of Unicef Bangladesh.\nAn analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world\u2019s most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.\nMs Farah Kabir, director of ActionAid Bangladesh, said that countries like Bangladesh, which contribute minimally to global emissions, urgently need funding to recover from climate-related losses and build resilience for future impacts while pursuing green development pathways.
