Over the weekend, the Jakarta Cathedral set up a photo spot on its premises featuring a large cut-out of Pope Francis. Merchandise such as statues and T-shirts bearing the pontiff\u2019s face have also been on sale.\nMr Gugun Gumilar, director of the Institute of Democracy and Education (IDE) Indonesia think-tank, said that the papal visit would show the world that his country can maintain diversity.\n\u201cMay this important event strengthen the Indonesia-Vatican bilateral relationship, and make Indonesia... be seen as an example of harmonious and peaceful religious dialogue for the world,\u201d he said on Aug 31 in an Instagram post.\nThe Pope will meet President Joko Widodo, as well as visit the famous Istiqlal Mosque and the Our Lady of the Assumption cathedral in Central Jakarta. The two religious sites are linked by an underground tunnel, known as the Tunnel of Friendship, which was built by the government in 2020 as a symbol of religious harmony.\nA key theme of the Pope\u2019s visit will be Islamic-Christian dialogue amid concerns of increasing discrimination and harassment against religious minorities.\nAccording to official figures, Catholics make up slightly more than 3 per cent of Indonesia\u2019s 270 million population. About 87 per cent of the country is Muslim.\nPope Francis is expected to hold meetings with representatives of Indonesia\u2019s six official religions and denominations \u2013 Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.\nThe chairman of the Indonesian Bishops\u2019 Conference, Mr Antonius Subianto Bunjamin, said in a press conference on Aug 28 that worshippers in the country have been praying that the Pope\u2019s visit goes smoothly. \u201cThis visit is not only about the Pope\u2019s presence but also about practising his teachings in daily life,\u201d he said.\nAt the same event, Cardinal Ignatius Suharyo, who is the Archbishop of Jakarta, highlighted Pope Francis\u2019 commitment to promoting good relations between different religious groups. He stressed that a focus of the Pope\u2019s visit is to help build bridges between diverse communities.\n\u201cThe Pope is the most influential leader on humanitarian issues globally,\u201d he said, noting the pontiff\u2019s focus on serving marginalised communities.\nAmong his aims for the trip to the region is pushing for global action on climate change. He posted about the issue on his Instagram account on Aug 31.\n\u201cLet us #PrayTogether that each of us listens with our hearts to the cry of the earth and of the victims of environmental disasters and the climate crisis, making a personal commitment to care for the world we inhabit,\u201d he said.\nPope Francis is the third leader of the Catholic Church to visit Indonesia in recent times. His trip comes after Pope Paul VI in 1970 and Pope John Paul II in 1989."}
