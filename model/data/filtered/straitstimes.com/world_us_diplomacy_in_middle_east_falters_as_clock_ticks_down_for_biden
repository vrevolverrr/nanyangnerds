Iran-backed Houthi rebels continue to attack Red Sea shipping, and now, despite intense US-led diplomacy, the Israel-Hezbollah conflict threatens to flare into an all-out regional war.\nWith the clock ticking on his administration, US President Joe Biden faces an arc of Middle East crises likely to defy solutions before he leaves office in January and which look all but certain to tarnish his foreign policy legacy, analysts and foreign diplomats say.\nMr Biden has struggled over the past year to thread the needle of embracing Israel\u2019s right to self-defence against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza and the Hezbollah group in Lebanon, while trying to contain civilian casualties and prevent a spiral into a broader Middle East conflict.\nTime and again he has confronted the shortcomings of that strategy, the latest being Israel\u2019s rejection on Sept 26 of a US-backed proposal for a 21-day truce across the Lebanon border as it pressed ahead with strikes that have killed hundreds of Lebanese.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing are the limits of US power and influence in the Middle East,\u201d said Mr Jonathan Panikoff, the US government\u2019s former deputy national intelligence officer for the region.\nPerhaps the clearest example of that trend has been Mr Biden\u2019s reluctance to exercise much US leverage \u2013 as Israel\u2019s top arms supplier and diplomatic shield at the UN \u2013 to bend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington\u2019s will.\nFor nearly a year, the US has sought unsuccessfully to help broker a deal between Israel and Hamas to halt the fighting and free hostages taken by the militants in the Oct 7 cross-border rampage that triggered the Gaza war.\nNo breakthrough is imminent, people familiar with the matter say.\nUS officials are quick to pin blame for failed negotiations on Hamas, but some also cite Mr Netanyahu\u2019s shifting demands.\nDuring US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s nine trips to the region since Oct 7, the top US diplomat several times found himself at odds with senior Israeli leaders.\nIn one instance in November 2023, Mr Blinken at a news conference urged Israel to pause its military offensive in Gaza to allow aid to enter the Palestinian enclave. Moments later, Mr Netanyahu rejected the idea in a televised statement, saying he had made clear to Mr Blinken that Israel was continuing with its operation \u201cfull force\u201d.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\nUS credibility at stake\nMr Biden has been credited by fellow Western leaders with reinvigorating key US alliances, including with Nato and top Asian partners, after his White House predecessor, Donald Trump, questioned the value of such relationships.\nThat was demonstrated in April when the Biden administration marshalled support from regional and European partners to help defend Israel from an Iranian drone and missile attack.\nBut some foreign diplomats say Mr Biden\u2019s handling of the volatile Middle East, especially his response to the Gaza war, has frayed US credibility abroad.\n\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s original blunder was to say (that) the US will, no matter what, stand for Israel,\u201d one Western official said. \u201cWe have never recovered from that.\u201d\nA Middle East diplomat said US diplomacy had \u201cfailed to impress adversaries\u201d and noted that Mr Biden sent military assets to the region after Oct 7 as a warning to Iran and its proxy groups, but that it did not seem to deter them completely.\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have kept up a steady barrage of missile attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, despite Mr Biden and other Western leaders providing warships for beefed-up protection.\n\u201cHe could have been quicker to respond and more severe to these attacks by proxy forces,\u201d said Mr Michael Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East under the Trump administration.\nUS officials have repeatedly pushed back on such criticism, saying their diplomacy has made a difference for the better and that the US military deployment to the region had helped so far to avert a spillover from Gaza into a regional war.\n\u201cDiplomacy is not a matter of snapping our fingers and \u2013 voila,\u201d US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council earlier in September. \u201cIt takes hard work. It takes effort and, unfortunately, it takes time. It has not failed.\u201d\nEven so, since Oct 7, Mr Biden has seen his hopes dashed for what was once touted as a potential signature foreign policy achievement \u2013 normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia coupled with US security guarantees for Riyadh.\nAt the UN, where the Security Council in June backed Mr Biden\u2019s plan for a Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal, there are signs that patience with US Middle East diplomacy has waned.\nJordan\u2019s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on Sept 26 that efforts to stop the violence in the Middle East constituted \u201ca year of failure\u201d and that if the Israeli government was not held to account, it was not going to listen to international law, \u201cand it\u2019s not even listening to its friends, including the US\u201d.\nMr Panikoff, the former intelligence official now at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington, described the crux of the Biden administration\u2019s Gaza dilemma as: \u201cPlan A hasn\u2019t worked for months. So where\u2019s Plan B?\u201d\nWith Israel threatening a ground offensive in Lebanon and vowing to keep pressure on Iran-backed Hezbollah until thousands of Israeli evacuees can return to their homes in the north, the crisis there could also deepen.\nThe trajectory of the Lebanon conflict could have further implications not only for Mr Biden\u2019s legacy but also by extension the presidential campaign of Vice-President Kamala Harris. Some Democratic progressive voters are already angry over unflinching US support for Israel.\nIt remains to be seen if Mr Netanyahu will heed Mr Biden\u2019s entreaties to avoid further escalation in Lebanon.\nAs a lame duck president in his final four months in office, analysts say Mr Biden cannot be faulted for keeping up his efforts to ease Middle East turmoil \u2013 but they expect his successor to inherit the current crises.
