One of the Confederates\u2019 most-used balloons was eventually captured.\n\u201cBy mid-war, both sides basically give up on balloons because of the logistical challenges that they posed,\u201d Mr Paone said.\nThose logistical challenges were evidenced during the siege of Yorktown, New York, in April 1862, when Union General Fitz John Porter decided to do some surveillance using only one tether rope, instead of the three or four recommended, according to the National Park Service.\nThe rope snapped. General Porter drifted over Confederate lines with no way to control the balloon. Enemy soldiers took a few unsuccessful shots at him, but the general and his balloon eventually floated back over to the Union side.\nGeneral Porter was close to General George B. McClellan. After the accident, General McClellan wrote to his wife, \u201cYou may rest assured of one thing: you won\u2019t catch me in the confounded balloon nor will I allow any other Generals to go up in it!\u201d\nBalloon operators in World War I were early adopters of the parachute\nHydrogen-filled balloons were crucial during World War I to help direct artillery fire, spot troop movements and note enemy positions like depots and trenches.\n\u201cAs a result, balloons become a prized target of the enemy,\u201d Mr Paone said. Some of the earliest uses of airplanes were missions to destroy them. \u201cWhen an observation balloon goes up, now everything that you\u2019ve done or everything you\u2019re trying to hide from the enemy can be seen.\u201d And the launch of one was often quickly followed by artillery fire, he added.\nEnemy fire could cause a balloon to explode, forcing American balloon observers who saw an attack coming to jump out. They were among the early adopters of parachutes.\nSilk parachutes were attached to the side of the balloon basket in cone-shaped devices. After jumping over the side of the basket, the observer\u2019s weight would cause the parachute to come out as they descended, Mr Paone said.\n\u201cThere are tales of observers who jumped two or three times in one day,\u201d Mr Paone said. \u201cThey would get attacked again; they jumped.\u201d\nJapan sent 9,000 balloons with bombs over the US in World War II\nThe only people to die in an attack on the continental US during World War II were six people who encountered a Japanese balloon bomb, known as a Fu-Go, during a picnic in Oregon in May 1945.\nThe victims, Elsie Mitchell and five children from a Sunday school class, were killed when they found the bomb and it exploded.\nFrom November 1944 to April 1945, Japan launched around 9,000 balloons carrying bombs to travel more than 6,000 miles (9,656km) across the Pacific Ocean to the US, according to the National Museum of the US Air Force. There were 285 balloons found in states, including Michigan, Wyoming and Texas.\nIn Europe, Americans used untethered blimps called K-Ships for observation and in a few cases for attacks.\n\u201cK-Ships become a critical aspect of anti-submarine warfare because they can hover and go slow and you can have a whole bunch of people with binoculars looking in all directions at the sea from a pretty good height,\u201d Mr Paone said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re able to see periscopes or other changes in the water that can point to a submarine.\u201d\nOn D-Day, the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, an African American unit, became the first barrage balloon battalion to land in France.\nBarrage balloons were large, unmanned tethered balloon whose cables created a hazard for aircraft, forcing them to fly higher and reducing the effectiveness of strafing and bombing, according to the National World War II Museum in New Orleans."}
