The total duty and goods and services tax (GST) evaded amounted to about $4,500.\nThree of the men arrested have been charged in court while investigations are ongoing for the others.\nAnother 11 men - six Chinese nationals and five Malaysians - were issued composition fines ranging from $500 to $5,000.\nCustoms officers were able to track down the buyers from the digital footprint of peddlers who were arrested earlier this month.\nThe Straits Times accompanied the enforcement officers on Tuesday afternoon.\nAt an industrial building in Second Chin Bee Road, four men in blue-collared shirts were led out by Customs officers into vans, where they were informed about the offence they had committed.\nOne of them, a Chinese national in his 50s, bought 44 packets of contraband cigarettes - a made-in-China brand - from his colleague, who got them from an online seller.\nThe cigarettes were found in the Chinese national's locker at his workplace.\n\"Contraband cigarettes are much cheaper... They cost $5 to $6 a pack compared with $13 for regular cigarettes, which I can't afford,\" said the man.\nHe received a $4,800 fine, an amount equivalent to nearly three months of his salary. He was given two weeks to pay the fine.\nIf he fails to pay the composition fine, a court fine may be imposed. Failure to pay that could lead to an order to attend court."}
