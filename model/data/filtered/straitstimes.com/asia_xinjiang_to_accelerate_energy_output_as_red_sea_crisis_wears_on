It will also speed up coal production while also increasing its reserves of oil and gas.\nThese plans were set out by the region\u2019s governor Erkin Tuniyaz in his work report on Jan 30 as he opened Xinjiang\u2019s annual parliamentary meetings in the capital city of Urumqi.\nIn a first, the Xinjiang government allowed some foreign diplomats and journalists to attend the opening ceremonies of the two meetings, which will go on for four days and will be attended by more than 1,000 legislators and delegates.\nXinjiang is one of the last of the 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions to hold their yearly legislative session ahead of the national conclave in Beijing in March known as the Two Sessions.\nThe meetings on the local and national levels bring together leaders, lawmakers and advisers to chart the year\u2019s economic and social agenda, pass legislation and present proposals.\nThe far-flung region grew by 6.8 per cent in 2023, just within range of the target of \u201caround 7 per cent\u201d set at 2023\u2019s parliamentary session.\nAgriculture and energy took priority as the country doubled down on its efforts for food and energy security.\nIts crude oil, natural gas and coal production went up, with coal increasing by 10 per cent. New energy capacity was also boosted by a third to reach 64.431 million kilowatt-hours, making up nearly half of the region\u2019s total power generation capacity.\nInternational trade has been severely disrupted by the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, a vital shipping route between China and Europe.\nAnalysts say the crisis has not affected oil flows into China significantly, but it has likely given pause to Beijing, which has already been diversifying its energy imports to minimise being caught up in vulnerable supply chains and price hikes.\nChina is the largest consumer and importer of energy in the world.\nDr Dong Jinyue, senior economist at BBVA Research in Hong Kong, said Xinjiang\u2019s growth in 2023 was hampered by the overall lacklustre recovery of consumption in the country after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted at the end of 2022.\nThat could have had some adverse impact on Xinjiang\u2019s tourism, goods and commodity demand, she said.\nXinjiang\u2019s 6.8 per cent growth had come off a low base of a 3.2 per cent expansion the year before, when China\u2019s punishing zero-Covid policy was still in place.\nIt had managed growth of between 7.6 and 10 per cent from 2014 to 2017, before slipping to 6.1 and 6.2 per cent in 2018 and 2019, just as international controversy erupted over its anti-terror re-education camps."}
