It has been suffering a brutal war for days. People are dying in the streets and we can\u2019t get to them,\u201d he said by telephone, using an eSIM that could connect to outside networks and declining to give a name, fearing Israeli reprisal.\n\u201cWe believe the number of dead people under the rubble is huge but there is no way to remove the rubble and recover them because of the intensity of Israeli fire.\u201d\nIn Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, medics said 12 Palestinians had been killed and dozens were wounded, while in Rafah in the south, they said an Israeli air strike left at least four people dead.\nIsrael said it had operated against \u201cterrorist\u201d targets.\nAround 19,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health officials, and thousands buried under the rubble after Israeli air strikes since Oct 7, when Israel says Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured 240 hostages in their surprise raid.\nIsraeli losses\nIsrael\u2019s military said on Dec 17 that 121 soldiers had been killed since the ground campaign began on Oct 27, when tanks and infantry began to push into Gaza\u2019s cities and refugee camps.\nMr Netanyahu read out a letter at his weekly Cabinet meeting on Dec 17 which he said was written by relatives of dead soldiers.\n\u201cYou have a mandate to fight. You do not have a mandate to stop in the middle,\u201d he quoted them as saying, and responded that \u201cwe will fight to the end\u201d.\nThe toll is already almost twice as high as during a ground offensive in 2014, a reflection of how far Israel has pushed into the enclave and of Hamas\u2019 effective use of guerilla tactics and an expanded arsenal.\nThe Israeli military said its ground troops had found weapons and a tunnel used by militants to attack troops in Shejaia, a suburb east of Gaza City in the north, and destroyed a weapons storage facility in the home of a Hamas operative.\nThe armed wing of Hamas ally Islamic Jihad said its fighters targeted Israeli forces in Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City with mortar bombs. Militants also fought Israeli troops in the centre of Khan Younis city in the south, residents said, while Israeli tanks shelled the eastern villages of Mughraqa and Juhr Eldeek in central Gaza Strip, where fighting has intensified with Hamas gunmen in past days.\nIn Khan Younis, residents reported hearing Israeli planes and tanks bombing and shelling and the sound of rocket grenades, apparently fired by Hamas fighters.\nMedics said Israeli forces had shelled the courtyard of the city\u2019s Nasser hospital and surrounding areas, with a new air strike on a school there on Dec 17.\nThe Israeli military said it had killed seven \u201cterrorists\u201d in an air strike on Khan Younis and found rocket-manufacturing parts and three tunnel shafts near a school used as a shelter. It also said it had struck the local Hamas commander\u2019s office and gained control over the central Bani Suheila Square.\nIsrael says it goes to great lengths to avoid hitting civilians as it seeks to eliminate Hamas, which has run Gaza since 2006 and is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction.\nNetanyahu vows to fight until victory\nMr Netanyahu said on Dec 16 the war in Gaza was existential and must be fought until victory, with the enclave demilitarised and under Israeli security control.\n\u201cThe instruction I am giving the negotiating team is predicated on this pressure, without which we have nothing,\u201d he told a press conference, sidestepping a question on the meeting in Europe between his spy chief David Barnea and Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.\nThe accidental killing of three hostages by Israeli forces has put increased pressure on Mr Netanyahu to find a way to secure the release of those held.\nHamas reiterated that it would not negotiate any exchange \u201cunless the aggression against our people stops once and for all\u201d.\nIn the southern town of Rafah, people rushed to help rescue families trapped under the rubble of a building that housed dozens of people, including some from the north who had followed Israeli army warnings to head south to avoid ground operations.\nMr Mahmoud Jarbou, who lives nearby, said the sound of the explosion that brought down the building was \u201cas powerful as an earthquake\u201d.\n\u201cWe were sitting in the house when suddenly shrapnel fell on us and people were screaming and streaming out into the street.\u201d REUTERS"}
