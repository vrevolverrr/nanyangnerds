In Asia, growth in China, the top oil importer, has slowed.\nTraders are also tracking an array of supply-related issues. While there has been significant unrest in both Libya and Iraq in recent days, oil output in both Opec members appears to be unaffected so far. Separately, talks to revive an Iranian nuclear deal that may unlock greater crude exports have dragged on.\nOil's decline last month marks the latest chapter in what has been a tumultuous year, with prices driven higher in the first half by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, then undermined as central banks shifted tack and Moscow managed to keep most exports flowing.\nCrude's recent slump prompted Opec+ heavyweight Saudi Arabia to raise the possibility that the alliance could cut output, although the Russian media reported that the grouping was not discussing such a move at present.\nThe main theme \"is pessimistic macroeconomic expectations, coupled with tight supply from low inventories\", said Mr Zhou Mi, an analyst at Chaos Research Institute in Shanghai.\nData on Wednesday highlighted the challenges facing China. Factory activity contracted in August for a second month, with the economy taking a hit from Covid-19 outbreaks, a property market crisis and power shortages.\nCommodities including crude oil have also faced headwinds from gains in the dollar, which makes raw materials more expensive for holders outside the US. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has climbed by more than 2 per cent in August as the Fed commits to higher interest rates, with the gauge approaching a record high that was hit in July.\nBLOOMBERG"}
