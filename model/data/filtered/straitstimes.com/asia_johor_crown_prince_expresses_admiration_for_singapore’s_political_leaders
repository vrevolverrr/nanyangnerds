I don\u2019t see them as competitors, I see them as a platform I want to reach.\u201d\nHe cited the multilingualism of Singapore\u2019s leaders as an example.\n\u201cIt all goes back to education,\u201d said the alumnus of the Australian International School in Singapore, adding that the education system in Johor is an area he seeks to improve.\nHe was speaking to Malaysia\u2019s former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin and former Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan on their podcast Keluar Sekejap (\u201cout for a while\u201d in Malay).\nThe episode was on the Crown Prince and his thoughts on politics at the federal and state levels, as well as his military training experiences in India.\nThe podcast was aired two days after the Crown Prince\u2019s father, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, was elected as Malaysia\u2019s next king.\nSultan Ibrahim will become the 17th king on Jan 31, 2024.\nThe Crown Prince said the friendly ties between Johor and Singapore \u2013 which date back decades to when his late grandfather was Sultan of Johor \u2013 are set to continue, with upcoming infrastructure projects including the \u201cgame changer\u201d Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link.\nThe RTS Link, set to be completed by end-2026, connects Bukit Chagar station in Johor Bahru and Woodlands North MRT station.\nIt will take passengers about five minutes to travel from one station to another and reduce congestion on the Causeway.\nHe added that he hoped the project, together with a special economic zone between Singapore and Johor that is in the works, will facilitate the flow of people travelling between the Republic and Malaysia.\nEarlier in October, Tunku Ismail thanked Singapore when he and his family took shelter at the Singapore Embassy in Bangkok after a shooting incident at the Siam Paragon mall.\nHe also made a three-day official visit to Singapore in July, meeting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and visiting the Singapore Armed Forces\u2019 commando unit in his capacity as the Johor Military Force\u2019s commanding officer.\nCorrection note: This article has been edited for accuracy."}
