In its place is subject-based banding, although students will continue to be allocated to secondary schools based on three broad categories. At Secondary 4, all students will take a common examination and receive a common certificate.\nThis change is important, as years of research on streaming (or ability-based tracking as it is known in the international scholarship) have shown that it leads to greater inequality in student performance, and is related to lower inter-generational mobility."}
