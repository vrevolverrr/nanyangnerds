He knows that the No. 1 priority is safety... This is the first (high-speed train) in Indonesia and Asean, and it has an advanced technology, so we have to be careful,\u201d Mr Budi said.\nHis ministry is currently doing safety tests, he said, while underscoring the complexity of the project.\nIn July, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Mr Widodo during the Indonesian leader\u2019s trip to China that both countries must ensure the project adheres to high standards as it nears completion.\n\u201cAny delay will mean delayed income (for the project operator), and there will be consequences on financial ratios. But we as technical people think safety is paramount, and the President has considered all consequences,\u201d Mr Budi said.\nKCIC is already struggling to deal with the project\u2019s cost overrun, especially as one of the consortium members, Indonesia\u2019s construction firm Wijaya Karya, is facing its own debt troubles.\nNegotiations for an additional US$560 million loan from the Chinese Development Bank are under way to complete the remaining construction.\nGiven the rising cost, there have been concerns that ticket prices will have to be set high to ensure investment returns.\nMr Budi said the train fare would be set at 250,000 rupiah to 300,000 rupiah (S$22 to S$27) \u2013 below the 350,000 rupiah estimate without government intervention \u2013 with the leader of the consortium, Indonesian railway firm Kereta Api Indonesia, expected to subsidise prices.\nStill, that would be twice the price travellers now pay for a trip between the two cities aboard a regular train.\n\u201cWe hope with the subsidy, the economical price will be near the price that the passengers are willing to pay,\u201d Mr Budi said.
