However, local business groups have been pushing the government above all to cancel hotel quarantine, arguing the city risks losing its status as a global financial hub if travel continues to be restrictive.\nA surge in infections will test Hong Kong's ability to relax travel curbs further, though Lo said the government is working on reducing the quarantine period for inbound travelers. The city reported almost 3,000 cases on Friday, and health officials have warned that daily infections could double in two weeks.\nLo also said that the city won't relax social distancing measures and will continue to focus on testing and isolation in order to reduce transmission and support Hong Kong's health system. He urged more people to get vaccinated.\nAbout 89 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated, but the ratio falls to 64 per cent for those 80 and above. The number of Covid patients in Hong Kong's hospitals has doubled from last month to more than 800, according to health officials. They've previously warned that if the situation deteriorates, hospitals may have to suspend non-essential care services to cope with the pressure.\nSeparately, Lo said in a Legislative Council question and answer session that a closed-loop quarantine arrangement proposed by the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance that would see travelers isolate in Hong Kong before going to mainland China wasn't something that can be achieved in a short period of time. He is communicating with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office about the plan, he said."}
