Both blazes have been qualified as severe.\nWeather service AEMET predicted maximum temperatures of 43-44 degrees Celsius (109.4-111.2\u00b0F) in parts of the country on Wednesday, which is expected to be the peak day of a heatwave, while the interior ministry warned of very high or extreme risk of wildfires across Spain.\nAEMET said that the Barcelona-Fabra observatory in the northeastern region of Catalonia registered an all-time high temperature of 40 C on Tuesday, beating its previous record of 39.8 C (103.64\u00b0F) set in July 1982.\nThis is the third heatwave in Spain over the last two weeks.\nRising global temperatures due to climate change have also contributed to more frequent wildfires elsewhere - from China to Canada. In Europe, they are also raging in the Balkans region. REUTERS"}
