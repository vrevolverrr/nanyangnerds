There\u2019s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.\u201d\nMs Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market.\nTurning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves.\nShe added: \u201cFlexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony.\n\u201cIt is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.\u201d\nShe stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks.\nMs Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly.\nThe tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said."}
