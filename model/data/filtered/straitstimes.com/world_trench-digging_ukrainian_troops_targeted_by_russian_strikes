These days, most of the fighting is in the east, for control of Ukraine\u2019s industrial Donbas region, in particular the city of Bakhmut, which has been almost completely destroyed.\nThe group leader continues: \u201cHalf of you dig, half of you can smoke, and then you change over. You dig until 2.30pm and then we get out of here,\u201d he said, mid-morning on Sunday.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Bakhmut, that\u2019s the front,\u201d he adds, pointing to all sides.\nThe soldiers on the first digging duty put their rifles in the grass and, shovels in hand, lined up along the designated stretch of ground. The others stand slightly back.\nBut the trench-diggers didn\u2019t even have time to start before the shrill sound of a rocket ripped through the air, exploding less than 50m away.\nSome soldiers dived to the ground, others ran to lie down at the edge of the adjacent wood.\nTwenty or so explosions in a row followed, close by or more distant.\nThe detonations followed one another for about 20 seconds. Then silence returned.\nA few soldiers stood up, but quickly fall back when two more explosions sounded.\nObservation drone\nWhen calm eventually returned, the team leader ordered the soldiers to run back towards the truck, parked about 50m away under cover of trees.\n\u201cGo, go!\u201d he shouted, relieved that there were no casualties.\nThe soldiers ran to the vehicle, some with shovels still in hand.\nOnce they were all in the truck they sped off, away from the immediate danger."}
