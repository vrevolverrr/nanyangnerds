He was 86.\nClose colleagues had visited him earlier in the day, reporting that he was in critical condition.\n\u201cAfter a long battle with cancer, our father... has just departed to meet the Lord,\u201d his daughter Keiko Fujimori wrote in a message on X, also signed by the former leader\u2019s other children.\nMr Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was the little-known chancellor of a farming university when elected to office in 1990.\nHe quickly established himself as a cunning politician whose hands-on style produced results even as he angered critics for concentrating power.\nHe slayed the hyperinflation that threw millions of Peruvians out of work, privatised dozens of state-run companies and slashed trade tariffs, setting the foundations for Peru to become, for a while, one of Latin America\u2019s most stable economies.\nUnder his watch, the feared leader of the Maoist Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, was captured \u2013 dealing a crucial blow to a movement that in the 1980s seemed close to toppling the Peruvian state. Guzman died in prison in September 2021.\nBut many Peruvians saw Mr Fujimori as an autocrat after he used military tanks to shut down Congress in 1992, redrafting the Constitution to his liking to push free market reforms and tough anti-terrorism laws.\nA slew of corruption scandals during his 10-year administration also turned public opinion against him.\nShortly after he won a third election in 2000 \u2013 amending the Constitution to run \u2013 videos emerged of his top adviser and spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos doling out cash to bribe politicians. Mr Fujimori fled to exile in Japan.\nHe resigned via fax from Tokyo and then unsuccessfully campaigned for a Japanese senatorial seat.\nMontesinos was later captured in Venezuela and jailed, convicted by the hundreds of videos he recorded of himself handing out cash bribes to politicians and business and media executives.\nThe cases against Mr Fujimori piled up \u2013 including accusations that he had ordered the use of death squads in his battle against Shining Path militants.\nMr Fujimori was safe in Japan \u2013 he was a dual citizen, and Japan does not extradite its citizens.\nSo many were shocked when in 2005 he decided to head back to Peru, apparently in hopes of forgiveness and a return to politics.\nInstead, he was detained during a layover in Chile, extradited to Peru in 2007, and in 2009 he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\u2018Fuji-shock\u2019\nOnce jailed, Mr Fujimori\u2019s public appearances were limited to hospital visits, where he often appeared dishevelled and unwell.\nWhile detractors dismissed his health complaints as a ploy to get out of prison, then President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski briefly pardoned Mr Fujimori in 2017.\nMonths later, Kuczynski was impeached, and the pardon overturned by Peru\u2019s top constitutional court, sending Mr Fujimori back to the special prison that held him and no other inmates.\nThe court restored the pardon in December 2023, releasing the ailing man, who had suffered from stomach ulcers, hypertension and tongue cancer.\nIn May 2024, Mr Fujimori announced he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumour.\nHis legacy has been most passionately defended by his daughter Keiko, who has been close to clinching the presidency herself three times on a platform that has included pardoning her father and defending his constitution.\nOutside Mr Fujimori\u2019s residence on Sept 11, supporters gathered to mourn and pray.\n\u201cToday, I weep for a leader,\u201d Fujimori backer Cesar Valverde said. \u201cHe should have been president again; we were working for Alberto Fujimori to be president again, but God has taken him.\u201d\nMs Fujimori had said in July that her father planned to run for the presidency again in the 2026 election.\nMr Fujimori was born in Lima on Peruvian Independence Day \u2013 July 28, 1938.\nA mathematician and agricultural engineer, Mr Fujimori was a political nobody when he decided to run for the presidency, driving a tractor to his campaign rallies.\nHe surprised the world by defeating renowned writer Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 election, with heavy support from the left.\nHe touted himself as an alternative to the country\u2019s white elite and gained crucial support from Peru\u2019s large indigenous and mixed-race populations.\nAs Peru battled what was among the world\u2019s worst hyperinflation, Mr Fujimori promised not to carry out drastic measures to tame it.\nBut in his second week in office, he suddenly lifted the subsidies that kept food essentials affordable, in what became known as the \u201cFuji shock\u201d.\n\u201cMay God help us,\u201d Mr Fujimori\u2019s finance minister said on TV after announcing the measure.\nInflation worsened in the short term, but the bet paid off, eventually stabilising the economy after over a decade of crisis.\nEven as support for him started to wane, Mr Fujimori pulled off audacious stunts in his second term.\nIn 1997, he devised a plan to dig tunnels under the Japanese ambassador\u2019s residence in Lima to end a four-month hostage crisis after another insurgency, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, took some 500 people captive for 126 days.\nIn a surprise attack, Mr Fujimori sent in more than 100 commandos in a raid that killed all 14 insurgents.\nOnly two commandos and one of the remaining 72 hostages died. TV footage showed Mr Fujimori calmly stepping over the corpses of the insurgents after the raid.\nMr Fujimori was married twice. A public falling-out with his first wife Susana Higuchi while he was president led him to name daughter Keiko as the First Lady.\nThe couple had three other children, including Mr Kenji Fujimori, also a politician.
