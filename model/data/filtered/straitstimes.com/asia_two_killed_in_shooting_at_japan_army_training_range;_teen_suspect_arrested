The suspect \u201cfired a rifle at the victim with the intent to kill\u201d, the spokesman told AFP.\nNational broadcaster NHK reported that the wounded were a man in his 50s and two other men in their 20s.\nAerial footage broadcast by the station showed military personnel and civilians gathered around an emergency vehicle and police blocking nearby roads.\nSome of the individuals seen in the footage appeared to be investigating the incident, as they were wearing covers over their shoes and hair.\nA local resident told NHK that he saw several emergency vehicles rushing to the area at around 9.30am local time (8.30am Singapore time), but had not heard anything before that.\nThe training range is administered by the region\u2019s Camp Moriyama and is a covered facility of more than 65,000 sq m.\nViolent crime in Japan is extremely rare, and gun possession is tightly controlled.\nBut several high-profile incidents have rattled the country recently. In July 2022, former prime minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead on the campaign trail by a man who allegedly targeted him over his links to the Unification Church.\nThe accused assassin, Tetsuya Yamagami, was due to make his first appearance in court this week, but the session was cancelled after a package sent to the facility set off a metal detector.\nIt was later found to contain no explosives, but rather a petition signed by thousands calling for a lenient sentence for Yamagami.\nHe has garnered a surprising amount of sympathy from some quarters over the effect that his mother\u2019s devotion to the Unification Church had on his family and childhood.\nIn April, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida escaped unharmed after a man threw an explosive device towards him at a campaign event.\nThat incident came shortly before Japan hosted the Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit in Hiroshima and prompted renewed calls for stepped-up security.\nThousands of police were sent to secure the gathering, which passed without a security incident.\nIn May, police in Nagano, west of Tokyo, detained a man after an hours-long knifing and shooting rampage, followed by an extended stand-off. The man, reportedly the son of the Speaker of the local city assembly, killed four people, including two police officers, before he was detained. AFP"}
