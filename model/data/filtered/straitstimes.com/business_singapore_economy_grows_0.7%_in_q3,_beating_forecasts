The latter saw broad-based weaknesses, with the exception of the transport engineering cluster.\nThe construction sector grew by 6 per cent year on year in the third quarter, extending the 7.7 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. Growth was buoyed by construction activities in the public and private sectors, though the momentum was beginning to wane.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the construction sector posted growth of 0.6 per cent, moderating from the 2.7 per cent growth in the second quarter.\nWithin the services sector \u2013 which accounts for around two-thirds of the economy \u2013 the outperformers were accommodation and food services, real estate, administrative and support services and other services.\nThese grew 4.7 per cent year on year in the third quarter, albeit slower than the 6.1 per cent growth in the second quarter.\nThe accommodation sector saw robust growth on the back of the continued recovery in international visitor arrivals.\nThe information and communications, finance and insurance and professional services sectors expanded by 1.5 per cent year on year in the third quarter, following a 1.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter.\nGrowth in the information and communications sector was supported by the information technology and information services segment. Growth in the professional services sector was driven by the architectural and engineering, technical testing and analysis and other professional, scientific and technical services segments.\nThe wholesale and retail trade and transportation and storage sectors slowed to grow 0.6 per cent year on year in the third quarter, compared with a 2.2 per cent expansion in the second quarter.\nOn a quarterly basis, the sectors actually shrank by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, a reversal from the 3 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter.\nThe finance and insurance sector contracted, largely due to the weak performance of the banking and insurance segments.\nDr Chua said the cooler services growth was within expectations, reflecting fading reopening tailwinds and slowing trade-related wholesale and transport services growth.\nMaybank kept its GDP growth forecast at 0.8 per cent for 2023 and 2.2 per cent in 2024.\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs raised its 2023 GDP growth forecast for Singapore to 0.8 per cent from 0.5 per cent following the higher-than-expected flash GDP figure.\nThe Wall Street investment bank is not expecting additional MAS tightening as core inflation pressures are expected to ease over the coming year.\nMr Ryota Abe, an economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, warned that the recovery might be short-lived, given that Singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector is driven by trends in global demand for goods.\n\u201cMAS\u2019 prediction that Singapore\u2019s economy will gradually recover in the second half of 2024, when rate cuts begin to take effect globally, is persuasive to some extent,\u201d he said.\nHis GDP growth rate forecasts are 1 per cent for 2023 and 2.2 per cent for 2024.\nHe said MAS will need to maintain the tight monetary policy for some time amid inflationary pressures.\nApart from uncertainties over the US and China\u2019s growth, economists also cited the conflict in the Middle East as among the potential downside risks to Singapore\u2019s economy.\nThe Israel-Hamas war is threatening to push up energy costs, even as Singapore gas, electricity and water tariffs are set to rise."}
