I was interested to see if this observation translated to higher rates of crime on hot days,\" she told AFP.\nShe and co-author Ghassan Hamra did indeed find violent crimes happened more often in the warmer months - May through September - and were highest on the hottest days.\nThe contrast was most striking on comfortable days in the colder months - October through April - compared to colder days in those months.\nWhen temperatures reached 21 deg C during that time period, daily rates of violent crime were 16 per cent higher compared to 6 deg C days, the median for those months.\nMr Hemenway believes that both of the main hypotheses on the subject - that more people being outside opens more possibilities of hostile interactions, and that heat itself makes people more aggressive - could be true.\nA striking study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2019 involved placing university students in Kenya and California in either hot or cold rooms and measuring the impact on a number of behavioural categories.\nIt found \"heat significantly affects individuals' willingness to voluntarily destroy other participants' assets\" in the form of gift cards and vouchers.\nWhen it comes to the overall issue of gun violence, there are far bigger drivers than temperature, Mr Hemenway acknowledged. These include the fact there were an estimated 393 million guns in circulation in the United States in 2020, more than the number of people, while many states have moved in recent years to ease rather than toughen restrictions.\nBut better understanding the relationship with weather could have policy implications - for example finding more activities for young males to keep them off street corners on the hottest summer days, and boosting police presence in key areas based on forecasts.\n\"It's sort of a harm reduction,\" said Mr Hemenway. \"But even if this wasn't a gun problem, I suspect we would find the same thing if we had evidence about fights and assaults. What the guns do is make hostile interactions more deadly.\""}
