In particular, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) in October was at 49.2, down from 49.6 in September, indicating that factory activities are shrinking.\nMeanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) hit a record high, rising 10.7 per cent year on year in September, reflecting the higher costs industries face in making products. It raises the pressure to pass the higher costs to consumers, which may lead to worldwide inflation."}
