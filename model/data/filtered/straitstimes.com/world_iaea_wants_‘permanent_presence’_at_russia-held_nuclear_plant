would seek to establish a permanent presence at a Russian-held plant in southern Ukraine to avoid \u201ca nuclear accident\u201d at the facility on the front line of the fighting.\nThe 14-strong team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is expected to arrive at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant on Thursday which lies inside Russian-held territory.\n\u201cMy mission is.. to prevent a nuclear accident and preserve the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,\u201d IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi told reporters after travelling from Kyiv to the city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\u201cWe are preparing for the real work which begins tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to try to establish a permanent presence for the agency.\u201d\nFresh shelling struck the town next to Europe\u2019s largest atomic facility on Wednesday, with the fate of the plant on the banks of the Dnipro River stoking global concern.\n\u201cThe Russian army is shelling Energodar,\u201d local military official Evhen Yevtushenko said on Wednesday morning, of the town next to the plant which had a pre-war population of 50,000 people.\nBoth sides have repeatedly traded blame over attacks in the area.\nOne of the shells hit Energodar\u2019s city council, Mayor Dmytro Orlov wrote on Telegram, posting pictures of the damaged building with a hole punched into the side.\n\u201cThe Russian occupying forces must stop shelling the corridors to be used by the IAEA mission and not obstruct its activities at the plant,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook.\n\u2018Explicit safety guarantees\u2019\nAlthough Zaporizhzhia is normally about a two-hour drive from the plant, it was not immediately clear how the IAEA team would reach the site which would involve crossing the front line to enter Russian-held areas.\nBut Grossi said his team had received \u201cexplicit\u201d safety guarantees from both sides for their visit which would last \u201ca few days\u201d.\n\u201cThese are very complex operations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are going into a war zone, we\u2019re going to occupied territory, and this requires explicit guarantees not only from the Russian Federation but also from the Republic of Ukraine and we have been able to secure that.\u201d\nThe plant has been occupied by Russian troops since March and Ukraine has accused Russia of deploying hundreds of soldiers and storing ammunition there.\nKyiv has insisted the team access the plant via Ukrainian-held territory.\n\u201cSadly, Russia is not stopping its provocations precisely in the direction the mission needs to travel to reach the plant,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky said late on Tuesday after meeting Grossi.\nThe situation was \u201cextremely menacing\u201d, he said, accusing the Russians of \u201ccontinuing bombardments\u201d and calling for \u201can immediate and total demilitarisation\u201d of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\nIn Moscow, the Russian defence ministry accused Kyiv of \u201ccontinued provocations aimed at disrupting the work of the IAEA mission\u201d saying it had shelled the area around the plant on Tuesday hitting a building containing \u201cthe solid radioactive waste processing complex\u201d.\nCounteroffensive in the south\nMeanwhile, intensive fighting raged across the nearby southern region of Kherson where Ukraine began a counteroffensive on Monday.\nMost of the region and its provincial capital of the same name were seized by Russian forces at the start of the invasion six months ago.\nWith the war in the eastern Donbas region largely stalled, analysts have said for weeks that combat is likely to shift south to break the stalemate before winter comes.\nIn its morning update, the president\u2019s office in Kyiv said \u201cfighting continued throughout the night\u201d in Kherson, and that one person had been killed and two injured in an overnight bombing in the Mykolaiv area.\nBut the Russian defence ministry said Kyiv\u2019s attempts to advance its counteroffensive had \u201cfailed\u201d with Ukrainian forces suffering \u201csignificant losses and were driven back by Russian troops\u201d.\nEU foreign ministers on Wednesday agreed to suspend a 2007 visa facilitation deal with Russia, which will make it \u201cmore difficult\u201d and \u201clonger\u201d for Russian nationals to get visas, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.\nHe said ministers had agreed that relations with Moscow \u201ccannot be business as usual\u201d and that the agreement should be \u201cfully suspended\u201d.\nAnd earlier in the day, Russian energy giant Gazprom suspended gas deliveries to Germany, citing maintenance issues in the latest of a series of supply stoppages that have fuelled an energy crisis in Europe.\nThe move comes as European countries have faced soaring energy prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and subsequently curbed its gas deliveries to the region.
