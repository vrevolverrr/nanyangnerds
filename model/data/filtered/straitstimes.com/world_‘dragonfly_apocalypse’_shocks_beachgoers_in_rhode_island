The two beaches are over an hour\u2019s drive away from each other.\nChildren could be heard screaming in fear while others were seen swatting the insects away from their bodies.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the end of the world!\u201d said one beachgoer in a video posted on TikTok.\nAccording to a TikTok user, the dragonflies flew in from the ocean, with several swarms flying in throughout the day.\nOne of the swarms lasted for about five minutes, she said in the comments section.\nWhile many were puzzled by the rare swarm of dragonflies, some said that it was a sign of good luck.\nA comment on a TikTok video read: \u201cA great omen. Dragonflies are symbols of rebirth and transformation.\u201d\nOthers rejoiced at the impending decline of the mosquito population that would be brought about by the dragonflies.\n\u201cAt least you won\u2019t see any mosquitoes for a while,\u201d said one netizen.\nAccording to Mr David W. Gregg, executive director of the Rhode Island Natural History Survey, the dragonflies \u2013 known as blue dashers \u2013 were most likely just \u201clooking for a better habitat\u201d.\n\u201cCentral Massachusetts and Rhode Island have been in a drought the last couple of weeks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat happened was their ponds started to dry up and the mosquito population started to decline, and suddenly it put pressure on them,\u201d he was quoted as saying by The Washington Post.\nHe added that a milder winter in 2024 likely contributed to more dragonflies hatching.\nThe dragonflies were probably moving north as the beach is not a good habitat for dragonflies, he said, assuring people that there is nothing to fear.\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid. (Dragonflies) don\u2019t bite or sting. The worst thing that can happen is they eat all the mosquitoes.\u201d\nThis is not the first spotting of a dragonfly swarm in the US.\nIn 2019, a high volume of dragonflies swarmed parts of the US and even appeared on the weather radar in three states \u2013 Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nAccording to CNN, Ohio State University Entomology Professor Norman Johnson said at the time that the dragonflies were probably green darners, which were on their way to the south in the fall.\nHe said that while dragonflies do not usually travel in swarms, local weather conditions can cause them to bunch up."}
