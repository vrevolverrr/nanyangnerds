{"title": "Forum: Fixed denominations restrict use of CDC vouchers, especially for budget meals", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2024-07-04", "content": "The recent news on more budget meals being offered was welcomed by those who seek nutrition and good value (180 more coffee shops to offer budget meals by end-July and accept CDC vouchers, July 1).\nThe way CDC vouchers are structured, however, can restrict customers who want to buy these meals with the vouchers.\nGiven that prices of budget meals range from $2.80 (available at Our Tampines Hub food centre) to $3.50, how can one practically spend the vouchers in denominations of $2 and $5 when no change will be given?\nThere must have been reasons why the CDC vouchers are structured in this way, but perhaps they could be designed to adopt the practical deduction system of the NS vouchers, which auto deduct the exact amount one spends. Some kind-hearted hawkers do return the change for amounts between $2 and $5. But others strictly accept the voucher amounts.\nPracticality and user benefits should be top priorities when designing the CDC payment deduction system.\nIf the CDC vouchers were distributed as two lump sums of $150 each and could be deducted according to the amounts actually spent, users would better enjoy the benefits instead of being restricted in using the vouchers or losing out on some precious cents \u2013 which can add up \u2013 because of the fixed denominations."}
