Others held photos of their loved ones lost in the crashes.\n\u201cI would like to apologise, on behalf of all of our Boeing associates spread throughout the world, past and present, for your losses,\u201d Mr Calhoun said while facing the families. \u201cAnd I apologise for the grief that we have caused.\u201d\nThe hearing was Mr Calhoun\u2019s first appearance before Congress since a January incident in which the door plug of a 737 Max 9 plane ripped off during an Alaska Airlines flight near Portland, Oregon.\nMr Calhoun, who plans to step down at the end of 2024, took over as chief executive in 2019 after two fatal crashes of a smaller version of the jet, the 737 Max 8. Those crashes, in which 346 people died, led to a 20-month global ban on the plane.\nMembers of a Senate investigative panel questioned Mr Calhoun about reports of the company retaliating against whistleblowers who raised safety and quality concerns, how parts made of questionable titanium made it into Boeing planes without detection and allegations of falsified inspection records involving the company\u2019s 787 Dreamliner.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, chair of the sub-committee holding the hearing, said Mr Calhoun had assured lawmakers that he was the leader Boeing needed to turn the corner after the Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.\nMr Blumenthal said the company had appeared to be heading in the right direction until the January incident, which he said exposed shortcuts the company had been taking.\n\u201cThis past January, the facade quite literally blew off the hollow shell that had been Boeing\u2019s promises to the world,\u201d Mr Blumenthal said. \u201cAnd once that chasm was exposed, we learnt that there was virtually no bottom to the void that lay below.\u201d NYTIMES"}
