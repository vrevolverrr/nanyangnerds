It will occupy mainly level 5 of the National Library Building.\nFrom early 2025, part of the collection will be housed at the National Design Centre in partnership with the University of the Arts Singapore.\nThe move is part of NLB\u2019s efforts to centralise its arts resources to better serve patrons such as students, researchers and practitioners from institutions and communities in the arts and heritage district.\nBefore closing for renovations, the library@orchard will run a three-week-long programme tracing its journey in promoting art and design.\nTitled Design Is For Everyone: A Decade Of Design, Arts And Community, it will run from Oct 8 to 27 and feature an exhibition and a community wall where people can share their memories of the library.\nOn Oct 26 and 27, patrons can create their own memorabilia at activity booths.\nMore details on the programme can be found on the Facebook page of LearnX Arts and the library@orchard page on ticketing platform Eventbrite.\nNLB chief executive Ng Cher Pong said: \u201cThe library has been a pit stop for many patrons, given its central location, unique range of resources and creative programmes, and, of course, its Instagram-friendly spaces.\u201d\nHe said it was timely now, after 10 years, to reimagine what more can be done with the space.\n\u201cThe revamp will bring an exciting next chapter for the library here in the heart of Orchard Road for everyone,\u201d he added.\nIn line with the Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025, NLB said it will continue to work with partners and the community to reimagine its libraries and archives.\nOther libraries which have revamps lined up include those in Ang Mo Kio, Queenstown and Toa Payoh.\nIn Toa Payoh, NLB is working with partners and the community to build a bigger library that complements the sports, healthcare and park facilities of the estate\u2019s upcoming integrated hub.\nMore details on the relocation will be announced closer to the date, NLB said."}
