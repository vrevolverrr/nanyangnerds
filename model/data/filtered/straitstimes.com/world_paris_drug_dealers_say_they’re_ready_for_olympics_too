One wrote: \u201cI inform you that despite the Olympics, the delivery service will remain the same.\u201d\nIt is too soon to gauge whether or how much prices could rise, but criminal lawyer David Curiel predicted they are on their way up.\n\u201cIn Paris a gram of cocaine costs \u20ac50 (S$73) to \u20ac60, but now it could probably go up to \u20ac80 a gram,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey (dealers) can\u2019t wait, for them this is like the sales,\u201d he added, referring to France\u2019s government-set promotion periods when shoppers flock to stores.\n\u2018Incredible\u2019 amount of drugs\nFrance has pledged to crack down on digital drug sales and has deployed massive amounts of police to patrol Paris during the Games, which is expected to attract 15 million people.\nBut will there be a boom?\nAn AFP check of drug sales prices advertised on messaging apps did not reveal an immediate spike, and police sources were also sceptical.\n\u201cNo \u2018Olympics effect\u2019 so far\u201d on boosting drug sales, a narcotics investigator told AFP, on condition of anonymity.\n\u201cThere\u2019s already an incredible amount (of drugs) on offer,\u201d the investigator noted.\nOn that much, the police and dealers seem to agree.\n\u201cDuring Covid it was different. There was an incredible spike in prices, by two or three times. It was a fight to find anything,\u201d the Parisian dealer said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fine ahead of the Olympics.\u201d\nThe real effect on Paris\u2019 \u2013 and France\u2019s \u2013 drug market will not become clear immediately but researchers have begun pondering the impact.\n\u201cLaw enforcement is heavily mobilised for the Olympics, but is that going to give (dealers) more opportunity to pursue their business elsewhere in France?\u201d asked economist Nacer Lalam.\n\u201cThat will be something we won\u2019t know until after the fact.\u201d AFP"}
