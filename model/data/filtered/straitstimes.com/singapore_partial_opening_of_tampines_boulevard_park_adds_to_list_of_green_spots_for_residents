Ideas were gathered through an online survey conducted from March to April 2020.\nMore than 600 responses were received, including requests for amenities such as a nature playgarden and a lawn for activities, both of which have been incorporated into the park\u2019s design, the National Parks Board said on Sept 13.\nThe nature playgarden features a slide designed to resemble a dragon head and was constructed using natural materials such as Balau wood and laminated wood grain panel. It aims to encourage play and closer connections to nature.\nChildren can also enjoy the park\u2019s sand play area, which includes swings and a rock wall. The amenity was inspired by the former Tampines sand quarries."}
