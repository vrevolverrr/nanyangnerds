The chief justice of the Supreme Court chooses its members.\nMr Gallant has broken ranks with Mr Netanyahu before.\nIn 2023, after months of nationwide protests against government plans to curb supreme court powers, Mr Gallant said proposed legislation should be dropped, warning the public dispute could hurt national security.\nMr Netanyahu immediately sacked him, spurring tens of thousands of Israelis to take to the streets in support of Mr Gallant. The veteran prime minister eventually relented and Mr Gallant kept his job."}
