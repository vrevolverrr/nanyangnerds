Williams was African American.\nSubsequent tests revealed DNA on the knife from a prosecutor and an investigator who had worked on the case and handled the weapon without gloves.\nThe contamination of the knife led prosecutors and Williams\u2019 attorneys to reach an agreement in August calling for him to enter a no-contest plea and receive a sentence of life in prison.\nThe state Supreme Court blocked the deal at the request of Missouri Attorney-General Andrew Bailey. A state judge upheld the conviction earlier in September, finding that the lack of evidence on the knife was not enough to establish his innocence.\nThe Missouri Supreme Court affirmed that decision on Sept 23.\nGovernor Parson, a Republican, also turned down Williams\u2019 request for clemency on Sept 23.\n\u201cWe hope this gives finality to a case that has languished for decades, revictimising Ms. Gayle\u2019s family over and over again,\u201d Governor Parson said in a statement after the execution. \u201cNo juror nor judge has ever found Williams\u2019 innocence claim to be credible.\u201d\nIn Williams\u2019 petition for clemency made to the Supreme Court, his lawyers noted that Ms Gayle\u2019s own family thought that he should not be executed, given doubts about his guilt, and that they had approved of his life-in-prison plea deal made in August.\nMr Laurence Komp and Ms Laine Cardarella, with the Federal Public Defender Office in the Western District of Missouri, who also represented Williams, said in a written statement that they were baffled as to why the \u201cadmitted racial discrimination\u201d in Williams\u2019 trial was left unaddressed.\nWilliams\u2019 public defenders said he adopted the name Khaliifah ibn Rayford Daniels after converting to Islam.\nThe corrections department released his handwritten final statement, in which he said: \u201cAll praise be to Allah in every situation!!!\u201d REUTERS"}
