The remaining were identified through random sampling and qualitative analysis, such as environmental scanning and tip-offs.\nUnderstating or omitting income due to incomplete recording of revenue was among the four common tax filing mistakes made by companies.\nExamples include food and beverage companies omitting sales earnings from orders placed through food delivery platforms and websites, and construction companies failing to declare income from the sale of scrap materials.\nIras also highlighted poor record-keeping practices at family-owned or managed companies.\nSome of these companies failed to retain enough support documents to substantiate their claims for purchases and expenses, while others did not draw clear distinctions between business and private expenses.\nSome claimed tax deductions on remuneration paid to company directors or family members that did not match the services rendered.\nOther common tax filing mistakes include wrong claims of capital allowances on assets that did not qualify as \u201cplant and machinery\u201d and failure to apply the arm\u2019s length principle for related-party services."}
