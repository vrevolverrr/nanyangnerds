They included 22 ships that would carry 700,000 tons of grain and eight ships readying 500,000 tons of other cargo.\nUkraine is one of the world's leading grain producers and exporters. Keeping grain exports flowing is key for its economy, which shrank by about a third last year. It is expected to grow by about 5% this year. REUTERS"}
