The charge carries a penalty of life imprisonment without parole.\nGendron is the first defendant to face a charge based on New York's domestic terrorism hate crime law, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said at a briefing after the arraignment.\nThe law was proposed after a mass shooting targeting Mexicans at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, and took effect Nov 1, 2020.\nGendron also faces 10 counts of first-degree murder and 10 counts of second-degree murder, all of them as hate crimes. The grand jury, which decides whether sufficient evidence exists to bring a defendant to trial, also returned three counts of attempted murder as hate crimes and a single count of illegal possession of a weapon.\n\"When you hear the phrase, throw the book at someone... Well, in this case, right here, the defendant just got 'War and Peace',\" Flynn said, referring to the 1,200-page novel by Leo Tolstoy."}
