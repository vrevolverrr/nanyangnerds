Nasa\u2019s Europa Clipper spacecraft is scheduled to launch this October yet beat Juice to Jupiter\u2019s moons by a year.\nLong and winding road\nJuice is taking the long way round in part because the Ariane 5 rocket used to launch the mission was not powerful enough for a straight shot to Jupiter, which is roughly 800 million km away.\nWithout an enormous rocket, sending Juice straight to Jupiter would require 60 tonnes of onboard propellant \u2013 and Juice has just three tonnes, according to the ESA.\n\u201cThe only solution is to use gravitational assists,\u201d Dr Arnaud Boutonnet, the ESA\u2019s head of analysis for the mission, told AFP.\nBy flying close to planets, spacecraft can take advantage of their gravitational pull, which can change its course, speed it up or slow it down.\nMany other space missions have used planets for gravity boosts, but next month\u2019s Earth-Moon flyby will be a \u201cworld first\u201d, the ESA said.\nIt will be the first \u201cdouble gravity assist manoeuvre\u201d using boosts from two worlds in succession, the agency said.\nJuice will cross 750km above the Moon on Aug 19, before shooting past our home planet the following day.\nThe probe will leave Earth at a speed of \u201c3.3km a second \u2013 instead of 3km if we had not added the Moon\u201d, Dr Boutonnet said.\nAs Juice whizzes past Earth and the Moon, it will use the opportunity to snap photos and test out its many instruments.\nDown on Earth, some people will be taking photos right back. Some lucky amateur sky gazers, armed with telescopes or powerful binoculars, may even be able to spot Juice as it passes over South-east Asia.\n\u2018Plate of spaghetti\u2019\nThe move has been carefully calculated for years, but it will be no walk in the park.\n\u201cWe are aiming for a mouse hole,\u201d Dr Boutonnet emphasised.\nThe slightest error during its slingshot around the Moon would be amplified by Earth\u2019s gravity, potentially creating a small risk that the spacecraft could enter and burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe team on the ground will be closely observing the spacecraft \u2013 and have 12-18 hours to calculate and adjust its trajectory if needed, Dr Boutonnet said.\nHe mostly feared a scenario in which the amount of course corrections needed would erase the gains from the double-world slingshot, meaning they would be \u201cdoing all this for nothing\u201d.\nIf all goes well, Juice will head back out into interplanetary space \u2013 for a little while at least.\nIt will first head to Venus for another boost in 2025.\nJuice will even fly past Earth twice more \u2013 once in 2026, then a final time in 2029 before finally setting off towards Jupiter.\nThen comes the really tricky part.\nOnce Juice arrives at Jupiter, it will use a whopping 35 gravitational assists as it bounces around the planet\u2019s ocean moons.\nDuring this phase, the probe\u2019s trajectory looks like \u201ca real plate of spaghetti\u201d, Dr Boutonnet said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing with the Earth-Moon system is a joke in comparison,\u201d he added.
