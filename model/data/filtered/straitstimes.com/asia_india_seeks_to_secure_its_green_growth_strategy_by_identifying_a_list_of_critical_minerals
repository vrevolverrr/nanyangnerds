For instance, Australia produces around half of the world\u2019s lithium and China controls most of the market for processing and refining of cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements.\nIndia, the world\u2019s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 \u2013 a goal that hinges on the assured supply of these minerals.\nDr Rajesh Chadha, a senior fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) in Delhi, said the list is an acknowledgement of how \u201cskewed critical minerals supply chains will impact India\u2019s green transition\u201d, but added that the government\u2019s attention should now be on securing a supply of these minerals for India\u2019s needs.\n\u201cIt has to be a multipronged strategy that optimises on the supply chain. This means if we find an opportunity to own and operate a facility out of the country, we should not miss it,\u201d he told The Straits Times.\nIn 2019, India formed Khanij Bidesh India (Kabil), a state-owned joint venture, to scout for and process strategic minerals overseas for use in India. Last week, Reuters reported Kabil is expected to sign an agreement with Argentina to secure a few lithium mining blocks there.\nThe focus has also been on striking bilateral as well as multilateral partnerships. In June, India was inducted into the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a US-led collaboration of 13 countries and the European Union that seeks to bolster critical mineral supply chains.\nOn the bilateral front, Australia and India launched a three-year Critical Minerals Investment Partnership in July 2022. The issue came up in May as well, when the Australian and Indian prime ministers met in Sydney and discussed increasing cooperation on mining and critical minerals.\nIndia is also working with a Japanese-owned subsidiary in the country to refine rare earth elements sourced domestically.\nThese partnerships, along with India\u2019s membership of the Quad\u2019s Critical and Emerging Technology working group as well as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, offer India an opportunity to work with like-minded partners to counter China\u2019s dominance in critical minerals and help secure global supply chains.\nHowever, experts say India will first need a strategy to make better use of its untapped geological endowments and build competitiveness in its domestic industry spanning exploration, mining and processing, including by opening it up to private players.\nCurrently, Irel (India), a central government enterprise, has a monopoly over the mining of rare earth minerals in the country.\n\u201cIndia has a massive potential but, broadly speaking, it is very difficult for private sector explorers to come in because they don\u2019t have the incentives to explore, especially as they don\u2019t easily get the right to mine the minerals they discover,\u201d said Mr Ganesh Sivamani, a research associate at CSEP.\nMs Ritika Passi, lead programme manager at Global Trade Observer, a think-tank based in Delhi, added the country must also prioritise specific critical minerals and their value chains, especially those \u201cwhere it\u2019s able to build excellence\u201d and secure investments and technologies for this goal, as China has done.\nChina, which accounts for only 14 per cent of global lithium reserves, has over the years acquired lithium mines overseas and built an efficient domestic processing industry that is today responsible for around 60 per cent of global lithium processing.\n\u201cIndia must look at building competitiveness to the extent possible given national resources and by also taking advantage of the geopolitical opportunity that has presented itself as countries look to diversify investment and trade,\u201d Ms Passi added."}
