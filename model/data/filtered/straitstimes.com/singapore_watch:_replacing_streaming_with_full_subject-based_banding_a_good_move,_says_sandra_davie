If you tell a kid that they are only able to learn a subject up to a certain level, and that they are not so academically inclined, the child begins to believe in that.\n\"It doesn't encourage the growth mindset as opposed to a limited mindset when it comes to learning,\" she added. \"It affects their confidence and self esteem as well.\"\nAnother reason why doing away with streaming is a good move is its ability to effect change on teachers and not just students, said Ms Davie.\n\"Teachers' expectations are powerful, it can actually affect a child's IQ levels,\" said Ms Davie, citing a study by Harvard psychologist Robert Rosenthal in the 1960s.\nThe study found that a group of students who were randomly selected to be labelled as having a potential for a growth spurt in learning, actually had gains in IQ due to the teachers' differential behaviour towards them, such as asking them more questions and paying more attention to them."}
