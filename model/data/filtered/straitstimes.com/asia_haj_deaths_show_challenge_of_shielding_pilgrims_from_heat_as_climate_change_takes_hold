If you are there and you need help, you should get access to it,\u201d said physician Khalid Al-Jabri, who worked for the Saudi security agency that oversees the haj and is currently part of the Saudi opposition in exile.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s international media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Health Minister Fahad Al-Jalajel said in a statement that the health authorities provided services to unregistered pilgrims on 141,000 occasions during the haj.\nBut he acknowledged that unregistered pilgrims \u201cwalked long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort\u201d, and added that 83 per cent of the 1,301 fatalities were among unregistered pilgrims.\nHeatstroke risk\nPilgrims said those without permits had to walk at times in temperatures above 50 deg C, while most registered pilgrims were able to make much of the journey by air-conditioned bus.\nA Reuters witness said he saw thousands walking on the highway near Mina, a vast tent city on the way to Mecca, rather than using buses like most registered pilgrims. Pilgrims told Reuters that Saudi officials routinely checked buses before departure to ensure only registered pilgrims were aboard.\nAlmost two million pilgrims made their way to Mecca in 2024 to perform haj rites as taught by the Prophet Muhammad to his followers 14 centuries ago.\nIt is not known how big the influx of unauthorised pilgrims was. But Saudi director of public security Mohammed Abdullah Al-Bassami said in June the kingdom had deported 171,587 people who were not residents of Mecca, in an apparent reference to people caught trying to perform the haj without a permit.\nHeat-related deaths during the haj are not new, but climate change has made it increasingly dangerous.\nA 2021 study found that if the world warms by 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, heatstroke risk for pilgrims on the haj will be five times greater. The world is on track to reach 1.5 deg C of warming in the 2030s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that is only getting worse with time,\u201d said Professor Elfatih Eltahir. He\u2019s a co-director of the Jameel Observatory and a professor at MIT who published a paper on the dangers of heat stress for pilgrims in 2019.\nSeeking religious tourists\nDespite such worrying climate projections, Saudi Arabia has said it wants to expand the numbers of religious tourists, aiming to welcome 30 million pilgrims for the haj and the year-round minor pilgrimage umrah annually by 2030, as part of its broader strategy to wean the economy off oil.\nIn 2019, Saudi Arabia earned about US$12 billion (S$16.3 billion) annually from the haj and umrah, according official data.\nHaj tours can cost from US$5,000 to US$10,000 per person, and the price is part of the reason many take unofficial packages.\n\u201cFinances are... a huge factor,\u201d said Mr Khaled El Sherbini, the owner of an Egypt-based tour agency.\nHe said an Egyptian could do the haj \u201cunregistered\u201d for 30,000 or 40,000 Egyptian pounds (S$850 or S$1,130), a fraction of an official package costing about 300,000 Egyptian pounds. In 2018 a haj package would have cost about US$3,000."}
