It will be the first launch for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the most powerful in the world and which has been in development for more than a decade.\n\"There's no guarantee that we're going to get off on Saturday, but we're going to try,\" said Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin.\nIf the mission goes ahead on Saturday, the Orion capsule fixed atop the rocket will spend 37 days in space, orbiting the Moon from about 100km away."}
