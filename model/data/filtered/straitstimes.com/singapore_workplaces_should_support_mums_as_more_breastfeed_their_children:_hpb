Among infants up to six months old, nearly 40 per cent were exclusively breastfed.\nKK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital said mothers who exclusively breastfed upon discharge rose from 75 per cent in 2013 to 86 per cent in 2021, while those who initiate breastfeeding in the hospital rose from 95 per cent previously to 98 per cent in the last three years.\nKKH launched Singapore\u2019s first and only milk bank for donor human milk in 2017, which helps premature infants as well as infants 12 months and under with medical problems such as malabsorption.\nThe National University Hospital (NUH) said more than 99 per cent of mums in NUH breastfeed their newborns.\nAt the Singapore General Hospital, breastfeeding rates upon discharge have remained consistent at nearly 90 per cent in the last five years.\nHPB said all three public maternity hospitals here are BFHI-certified, and one private hospital \u2013 Raffles \u2013 is also certified.\nThe BFHI or Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, is part of a global effort by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) to ensure maternity hospitals meet best practice standards in supporting mothers to breastfeed successfully.\nNearly all maternity hospitals here, including private hospital Thomson Medical, said they have stopped accepting sponsorships from milk companies, and milk brands are fed to infants on a rotating basis in hospitals.\nMothers here are also breastfeeding longer, with a NielsenIQ Baby Power 2022 study showing women were nursing their babies for an average of 11.8 months in 2022, up from 8.1 months in 2018.\nExperts have long extolled the health benefits of breastfeeding, noting that breastfed children are healthier, perform better on intelligence tests and are less likely to be overweight or suffer from diabetes later in life.\nMs Eunice Choo, a senior teacher, had a better experience at her workplace, Rainbow Centre, where she and some colleagues would express milk together in the nursing room.\nShe had a tough first few weeks of breastfeeding. \u201cThe baby and I were both learning, he couldn\u2019t latch on properly and kept crying because he couldn\u2019t get milk,\u201d she said. But once she got the hang of it, it was easy.\nDoctors said educating new mothers on the benefits of breast milk is important, as misinformation, as well as conflicting advice, from well-meaning family and friends is common.\nThe Nielsen study showed that 64 per cent of mums rely on the Internet and 50 per cent on word of mouth for information on formula milk.\nThe most common assumption is that the mother does not have enough milk, said lactation consultant Wong Boh Boi. \u201cSo she gives up breastfeeding before it is established,\u201d said Dr Wong, adding that it takes about two weeks to establish breastfeeding.\nShe added that new mothers should get help from lactation consultants and breastfeeding support groups.\nShe also stressed the importance of support from immediate family.\nMilk storage at work an issue\nRachel (not her real name), who works in healthcare, said storing her breast milk at work is an issue, as the pantry fridge is usually packed with her colleagues\u2019 food. She is worried about spillage and contamination of her milk.\nCompared with her friends in the private sector who have to express milk in meeting rooms, she considers herself lucky to be able to use a nursing room. But the room has no water and cleaning facilities.\n\u201cI have to prepare wet tissues to do the cleaning. There is no table, so I have to be extra careful when pouring the milk into the storage bag,\u201d she said.\nAnother new mother, Nicole (not her real name), said breastfeeding was costly for her as she had to buy the right breast pump and supplements to ensure a good milk supply.\n\u201cBreastfeeding is more stressful than giving formula milk, which my husband and helper can do,\u201d said the programme manager in a multinational corporation.\nBut even with a supportive workplace, hectic work schedules can make expressing milk challenging.\nA senior account executive who wanted to be known only as Cheryl L said her workplace at an international advertising agency has a dedicated mother\u2019s room for expressing milk, including a fridge to store it.\n\u201cI pump three times a day at work,\u201d said the mother of a five-month-old and a two-year-old. \u201cIt is difficult sometimes because there are back-to-back meetings. Then I get stressed because if I don\u2019t pump regularly, the milk supply will dip.\u201d"}
