Without the algae\u2019s help in delivering nutrients to the corals, the latter cannot survive.\n\u201cMore than 54 per cent of the reef areas in the global ocean are experiencing bleaching-level heat stress,\u201d Coral Reef Watch coordinator Derek Manzello said.\nThe announcement of the latest global bleaching event was made jointly by Noaa and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), a global intergovernmental conservation partnership.\nFor an event to be considered global, significant bleaching must occur in all three ocean basins \u2013 the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian \u2013 within a 365-day period.\nLike 2024\u2019s bleaching event, the last three \u2013 in 1998, 2010, and 2014 to 2017 \u2013 coincided with an El Nino climate pattern, which typically ushers in warmer sea temperatures.\nSea surface temperatures over the past year have smashed records that have been kept since 1979, as the effects of El Nino are compounded by climate change.\nCorals are invertebrates that live in colonies. Their calcium carbonate secretions form hard and protective scaffolding that serves as a home to many colourful species of single-celled algae.\nScientists have expressed concern that many of the world\u2019s reefs will not recover from the intense, prolonged heat stress.\n\u201cWhat is happening is new for us, and to science,\u201d said marine ecologist Lorenzo Alvarez-Filip at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\nHe added that \u201cwe cannot yet predict how severely stressed corals will do\u201d, even if they survive immediate heat stress.\nRecurring bleaching events are upending earlier scientific models which forecast that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs could be lost when global warming reaches 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial temperatures. To date, the world has warmed by some 1.2 deg C.\nIn a 2022 report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, experts determined that just 1.2 deg C of warming would be enough to severely impact coral reefs, \u201cwith most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature\u201d.\nThe global bleaching event in 2024 adds further weight to concerns among scientists that corals are in grave danger.\n\u201cA realistic interpretation is that we have crossed the tipping point for coral reefs,\u201d said ecologist David Obura, who heads Coastal Oceans Research and Development Indian Ocean East Africa from Mombasa, Kenya.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going into a decline that we cannot stop, unless we really stop carbon dioxide emissions\u201d that are driving climate change, Dr Obura added.\nCoral reefs are estimated to provide some US$2.7 trillion (S$3.7 trillion) in goods and services every year \u2013 with benefits such as attracting tourists, protecting coastal communities from storm surges, and supporting coastal fisheries, according to a 2020 valuation by ICRI\u2019s scientific network.\nGlobal bleaching could be worst yet\nWith bleaching surveys ongoing in the Indian Ocean and Pacific, Noaa experts expect that this global bleaching event could turn out to be the most extensive yet.\nCaribbean reefs experienced widespread bleaching in August 2023 as coastal sea surface temperatures hovered between 1 deg C and 3 deg C above normal. Scientists working in the region then began documenting mass die-offs across the region.\nFrom the staghorns to brain corals, \u201ceverything that you can see while diving was white in some reefs\u201d, Dr Alvarez-Filip said. \u201cI have never witnessed this level of bleaching.\u201d\nBleached corals can recover if waters cool, but some Caribbean corals were so stressed that they continued to die even as temperatures dropped over winter, Dr Alvarez-Filip added.\nFlorida corals subjected to extreme heat shocks did not even have time to bleach, Mr Manzello said.\n\u201cThey got so stressed, they just died and sloughed off their tissue,\u201d he said.\nAt the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer in March, tropical reefs in the Pacific and Indian oceans also began to suffer.\nA record-breaking number of individual reefs within the Great Barrier Reef have suffered from heat stress in recent months, and many are now draining of colour, said coral biologist Neal Cantin at the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. Dr Cantin noted that marine heatwaves were registering some 2.5 deg C above the normal summertime maximum.\nRecent aerial surveys have shown \u201cvery high\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d levels of bleaching in nearly half of surveyed reefs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area.\nThat makes this the fifth bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef in just nine years \u2013 far more frequent than the twice per decade that scientists expected by the 2030s.\nIndian Ocean reefs off Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya and the Seychelles have also suffered bleaching, though not as severely as in 2016, thanks to an early change in the 2024 monsoon leading to cooler conditions, Dr Obura said.\n\u201cThe stress experienced by corals in the region is likely less than it could have been, which is very lucky,\u201d he said.
