Wilmar International should also benefit given its large market share in consumer staples in China.\u201d\nCompanies like CapitaLand China Trust, Yangzijiang Financial, Hong Leong Asia, Nanofilm Tech, Hutchison Port, Jardine Matheson, DFI Retail and numerous others with significant China exposure are also seen benefiting from the \u201cChina fever\u201d.\nThe Hong Kong and mainland China markets have also rallied strongly.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index has risen almost 15 per cent since Sept 27, bringing its total gain since Sept 20 to almost 20 per cent. The Shanghai Composite index was up nearly 10 per cent on Sept 27 before closing for the Golden Week holiday.\nIn Singapore, the FTSE ST China Index is up about 10 per cent over the past five trading sessions, outpacing most regional markets and Singapore sectors.\nWhile the immediate impact on markets is obvious, analysts are also watching to see how effective the stimulus measures will be over time.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think these monetary measures will immediately reverse the weakness in demand,\u201d noted Phillip Capital in a recent note.\n\u201cIt will be a gradual improvement in consumption through a wealth effect. This is similar to the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing objective. Only a bump in fiscal spending can reverse the economy in the short term.\u201d\nStill, there seems to be a consensus among experts that the rally can be sustained in the near term because of a significant re-rating of China as the risk of a sharper economic downturn diminishes.\nAnalysts are also optimistic that the China stimulus could spark a recovery of some beaten-down stocks towards fair values.\nYanlord Land, despite surging almost 60 per cent in recent days to just below 70 cents, is considered a quality China property play with a net asset value of $3.24 per share and cash at $1 per share.\nSimilarly, Sasseur Reit, which has risen about 6 per cent in recent days, is seen as benefiting from a recovery in domestic consumer spending, especially through this Golden Week. The Reit holds retail properties in China in its portfolio.\nHowever, OCBC Investment Research head of research Carmen Lee warned that a resurgence of the North-east Asia markets like Hong Kong could also potentially divert funds away from South-east Asia.\n\u201cThe inflow of funds into China and Hong Kong equities is real and strong, and this has the potential to divert interest away from South-east Asia,\u201d she noted.\nBut for the moment the general market view is that the \u201cChina fever\u201d rally still has some legs, especially if the Chinese economy responds positively to the stimulus."}
