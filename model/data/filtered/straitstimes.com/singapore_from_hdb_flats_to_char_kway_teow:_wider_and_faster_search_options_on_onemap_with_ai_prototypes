Aspiring home owners may soon be able to type these keywords in natural language on a portal and find a list of units for sale and their locations overlaid on a map.\nTech giant Huawei has developed a prototype portal that uses multiple large language models of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as Meta\u2019s Llama 2, to search the databases of property firms and government agencies to extract useful data and generate maps.\nIt is one of two projects that won the OneMap GPT Challenge, which aimed to make the national OneMap more relevant to the public, government agencies, statutory boards, real estate companies and other businesses.\nOneMap is a national map developed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA). The OneMap website and app currently show property prices, land ownership, the nearest amenities and demographic data, plotted against a 2D map.\nThe challenge required participants to enhance the functions or introduce new ones by using generative AI technologies and incorporating useful map-based information extracted from government data to offer users greater convenience.\nThis will simplify the process of sourcing information from property websites, maps and the Housing Board portal.\nHuawei\u2019s prototype allows users to shortlist suitable properties near their parents\u2019 home. They can type \u201clooking for properties in Tampines near my parents\u2019 place. Anything with HDB under $800k?\u201d, and a list of available properties is generated in text and displayed on a map.\nOther relevant information such as nearby schools and MRT stations is also listed.\nIf the users type \u201cDo I qualify for HDB\u2019s proximity housing grant?\u201d, the prototype will ask for their parents\u2019 address before generating relevant results.\nIt can also be used to plan a fun-filled itinerary by typing questions such as \u201cWhere can I take my two kids, aged 8 and 10, and my parents to have a fun time during the school holidays?\u201d\nThis generates a list of activities that are suitable for adults and children with the specified ages. The activities are also displayed on a map on the same webpage.\nThe results can be refined by typing a specific location, time or weather conditions.\nTo generate search results, Huawei taps data from OneMap, government agencies such as HDB, National Environmental Agency, SBS Transit and companies such as PropNex, ERA and Sheng Shiong.\nThe contest was organised by SLA in October 2023, in collaboration with the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority.\nThe other winning entry is from local start-up BuzzAR, which created a prototype app with a chatbot that it described as an AI-powered digital human built using its \u201cproprietary avatar engine\u201d.\nDubbed BAE, short for Buzz\u2019s Amazing Entity, the prototype caters to tourists by providing relevant information and recommendations.\nUsers can type \u201cWhere is the best char kway teow in eastern Singapore?\u201d as if they are talking to a real person, and relevant results will be displayed in the app.\nBuzzAR, which develops augmented reality and AI solutions for the tourism and retail sectors, makes use of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 technology to translate natural language queries to gather data from OneMap and the Singapore Tourism Board.\nThe two winning prototypes were unveiled at Geo Connect Asia 2024 on March 6. The geospatial conference was held at Sands Expo and Convention Centre on March 6 and 7.\nBuzzAR and Huawei each won $50,000 for their entries. SLA aims to hold a public trial for both prototypes by end-2024.\nBuzzAR and Huawei demonstrated innovative approaches to enrich the OneMap user experience, supported by their readiness for implementation of the prototypes, as well as their proven products, services and technical expertise, said SLA, one of the organisations on the judging panel, which also included AI Singapore and GovTech.\nAt the same event, a function that allows wheelchair users to find barrier-free routes on the OneMap app was officially launched.\nThe Straits Times reported in January that this function is available for selected areas such as Bukit Merah, Ang Mo Kio, Orchard Road, River Valley, Marina South, Punggol, Tanglin and the Singapore River precinct. It will be expanded to cover more areas.\nSLA and the Ministry of Health\u2019s Office for Healthcare Transformation also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) at Geo Connect Asia 2024 to develop a web-based map service.\nThis is an enhancement to the Digital Local Connect initiative that consolidates information from health and social services for community partners such as NTUC Health and Methodist Welfare Services, grassroots volunteers and general practitioners. Yio Chu Kang is the first of six precincts to introduce the service since December 2023.\nThe data is consolidated from health services such as general practitioner clinics, dental care, inpatient rehabilitation, dialysis and specialist centres, as well as social services that provide financial, family, disability, dementia and caregiving support.\nThe data includes details of services and programmes, opening hours, contact details and a map to display nearby services within a specified location.\nUsers currently have to source for such information from various platforms.\nAnother MOU was signed between SLA and SingHealth Community Hospitals to develop a \u201cliving asset map\u201d, another web-based service that aims to connect Singaporeans to support groups, interest groups, volunteer organisations and community centres, which support holistic health and well-being.\nCoordinators in the health and social care sectors will be able to use the map to link patients and clients to organisations such active ageing centres and group activities such as tai chi and zumba.\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, who was one of the speakers at the event, said: \u201cSustaining good health is a lot more than what happens in the hospitals or clinics. It is about the everyday choices that we make \u2013 our behaviour patterns, whether we are socially active... making sure that our social and mental well-being is preserved.\n\u201cSo I hope that using geospatial tools to support social prescribing will enable more Singaporeans to lead healthier and more active lives.\u201d"}
