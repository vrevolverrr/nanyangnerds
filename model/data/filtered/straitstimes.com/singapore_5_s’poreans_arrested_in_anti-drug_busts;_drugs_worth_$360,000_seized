The first arrest, of a 33-year-old man, was made at a staircase landing of a residential block for suspected drug trafficking offences. About 965g of heroin and 24g of Ice were recovered after he was searched.\nThe officers then raided a flat in the same block that the man was seen leaving earlier, and arrested three occupants aged 16, 17 and 39 for suspected drug offences.\nCNB said officers had to force their way into the unit as the occupants refused to comply with orders to open the door.\nAfter entering the unit, the officers first arrested the 39-year-old man in the bathroom, where he was suspected to have been disposing of controlled drugs in the toilet bowl.\nAbout 1,841g of heroin, 331g of Ice, 43 Ecstasy tablets, 162 Erimin-5 tablets, various drug paraphernalia and offensive weapons were seized from within the unit.\nIn the second bust, CNB officers arrested a 26-year-old Singaporean man for suspected drug trafficking offences in the vicinity of Serangoon North Avenue 1. About 10g of Ice was recovered from him in a search.\nAfter he was escorted to a flat, another estimated 19g of Ice, 3,361g of cannabis, drug paraphernalia, and electronic vaporisers used to consume cannabis-containing vaporiser pods were seized from within the flat.\nIt is an offence for a person to traffic in a controlled drug, or to offer to traffic in it on anyone\u2019s behalf, the CNB said.\nIt is also an offence to carry out or to offer to perform any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug.\nA person found guilty of trafficking more than 250g of Ice or 500g of cannabis faces the mandatory death penalty.\nInvestigations into the drug activities of all the suspects arrested are ongoing.\nSingapore has a strict policy of zero tolerance towards controlled drugs such as heroin, Ice and cannabis, CNB added.\nIn some instances, controlled drugs such as cannabis are added as ingredients in edibles like candies and baked goods, or to vaping pods, and irresponsibly marketed as harmless consumables.\nIllicit drugs, including cannabis, are harmful, addictive and destroy lives, families and communities, CNB said.\nThe importation and exportation, possession, sale and consumption of controlled drugs or products containing controlled drugs is an offence, CNB reminded the public.\nThe 2022 Health and Lifestyle Survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health found that for those who abused drugs, the average age when they first took drugs was 15.9, and 52 per cent of these abusers started out with cannabis.\nCNB also urged parents to play an active part to protect youth from drugs, and to remind their children that they should not consume or accept products unknown to them or offered by strangers.\nSome products may be marketed as health products, and contain hemp, hemp seed oil, CBD oil, cannabis oil, or claimed to be free of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\nAny products containing hemp derivatives as an ingredient or derived from the cannabis sativa plant or its seeds can contain controlled drugs such as THC, despite the product labels indicating otherwise, CNB added.\nMembers of the public can call the CNB hotline on 1800-325-6666 for advice and assistance if they come across products or consumables suspected to contain drugs or are worried that their children may be involved with drugs.\nThose who have drug-related information can make a report to CNB by calling 1800-325-6666 or at https://www.eservices.cnb.gov.sg/feedback"}
