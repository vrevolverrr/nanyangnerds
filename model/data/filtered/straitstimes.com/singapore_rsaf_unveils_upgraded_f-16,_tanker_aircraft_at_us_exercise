The larger third screen allows them greater flexibility to view information they need.\nBoosting the capability of RSAF jets is a new automated air-to-air refuelling system being used by the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).\nThe plane plays a crucial role in extending the endurance of friendly aircraft by refuelling them in the air, and this capability is further enhanced by the automated system, which Singapore is the first to adopt.\nCameras on the MRTT detect incoming aircraft seeking to refuel, with image processors helping to identify the receiver aircraft.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very similar to your facial recognition,\u201d said air refuelling operator, Second Sergeant Vikneshvar Vijayandhran, of the RSAF\u2019s 112 Squadron, which operates the tanker.\nPrior to this, air refuelling operators had to manually connect the refuelling boom to the receptacle of another aircraft that has positioned itself behind the MRTT.\nSingapore media got a first-hand look at the automatic refuelling of F-16 fighter jets on board the MRTT last Thursday afternoon.\nLTC Daryl Yeo, 39, the squadron\u2019s commanding officer, said the automated system is more precise and speeds up the refuelling process, as \u201ccomputers can do things much faster than a human being\u201d.\n2SG Vikneshvar, 25, said the precision of the automated system allows operators like himself to focus on other essential tasks, such as facilitating the flow of aircraft awaiting their turn to refuel, as well as reduces fatigue.\nDespite the tangible benefits of the system, having a human on hand to step in remains a necessity, he added.\n\u201cThere are certain things that we cannot instil within machines, such as safety instincts.\n\u201cSo even if the automatic air-to-air refuelling system is in play, the operator will always be on standby to monitor... just in case there are external factors, so that they can do a timely takeover.\u201d"}
