His former Goldman boss and 1MDB co-conspirator, Tim Leissner, previously pleaded guilty and was the government\u2019s star witness against Ng.\nLeissner is scheduled to be sentenced in September.\nThe looting of billions of dollars from the 1MDB fund was allegedly masterminded by Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who is now a fugitive.\nHe is accused of paying tens of millions of dollars to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to clinch bond deals arranged by Goldman, while pocketing US$1.42 billion (S$1.91 billion).
