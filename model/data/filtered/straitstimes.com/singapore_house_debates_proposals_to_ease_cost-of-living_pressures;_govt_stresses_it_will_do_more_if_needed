We review our support regularly and step in to enhance it where necessary to provide additional support, especially for lower- and middle- income families.\u201d\nThis includes means-tested U-Save utility rebates, the GST Voucher scheme and the Assurance Package, meant to offset the goods and services tax (GST) rate increase. The package has been enhanced twice since it was launched in 2022.\nThe Government will continue to monitor trends closely and is prepared to do more to support Singaporeans should it become necessary, said Mr Chee.\n\u201cWe will do so in a manner which is fair, effective and sustainable for both current and future generations,\u201d he added.\nThe discussion in Parliament arose from a motion put forth by Leader of the Opposition and WP chief Pritam Singh and Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC). It called on the Government to review its policies to lower cost-of-living pressures for Singaporeans and their families.\nAll eight WP MPs spoke during the debate, covering areas such as physical and mental health, transport, utility costs and means-testing in the public healthcare system.\nMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied GRC) suggested an electricity pricing structure based on time of use to discourage peak-hour consumption.\nMr Dennis Tan (Hougang) proposed that means-testing take into account the specifics of individual financial situations, in particular cash flow, and Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) called for more MediSave top-ups for those with low balances to address healthcare inflation.\nKicking off the debate, Mr Singh said the WP had spoken frequently about the issue of cost of living, mentioning it as a major pressure point for low- to middle-income families in his 2022 New Year\u2019s message, and at various points since.\nWhile acknowledging the Government\u2019s one-time relief measures, he said national policies need to be re-examined to remain relevant as \u201cfor some Singaporeans this has become a cost-of-living crisis\u201d.\nAlthough headlines state that inflation is stabilising, price rises continue to hit Singaporeans hard, Mr Singh added.\n\u201cWhen income growth cannot match (the) rise in prices, it is perfectly understandable why Singaporeans feel nervous and anxious.\u201d\nHe reiterated that the Government would honour its assurance \u2013 provided at Budget 2023 \u2013 that it would fully cover the increase in spending by lower-income households in 2023 due to inflation and the GST increase.\nIt would also substantially cover the increase for middle-income households.\nFor example, the Government in September announced a $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package to provide relief for all Singaporean households, with more support for lower- to middle-income families, building on measures announced at Budget 2023.\nMr Chee said he welcomed the WP\u2019s call for a review of policies. \u201cThe Government has been renewing our policies, including as part of Forward Singapore,\u201d he added.\nSome changes have already been announced, such as the Majulah Package for young seniors and the new housing classification model. New initiatives have also been proposed, such as the re-employment support scheme.\nThe WP and PSP MPs did not vote in favour of the amended motion at the end of the debate, which saw 20 MPs speak."}
