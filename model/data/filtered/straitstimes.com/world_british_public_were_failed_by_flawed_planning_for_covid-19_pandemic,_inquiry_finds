That strategy was virtually abandoned on its first encounter with Covid-19.\n\u201cThe secretaries of state for health... who adhered to the strategy, the experts and officials who advised them to do so and the governments of the devolved nations that adopted it, all bear responsibility for failing to have these flaws examined and rectified,\u201d the report said.\nMs Hallett made 10 recommendations, saying preparation for a civil emergency should be treated the same way as a threat from a hostile state.\n\u201cThere must be radical reform. Never again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering,\u201d she said in her introduction to the report.\nHer inquiry\u2019s first module has examined only Britain\u2019s preparedness, and later reports will provide assessments of the more politically charged issues of decision-making during the pandemic against a backdrop of widespread accusations of government incompetence.\nMr Johnson himself was forced from office in July 2022, with revelations of parties during Covid-19 lockdowns among the many scandals that ended his premiership. A parliamentary committee later concluded that he misled lawmakers over the parties.\nMr Rishi Sunak, the finance minister during the pandemic who later became prime minister, was also fined for breaking lockdown rules at the time.\nMs Brenda Doherty, on behalf of the campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK ahead of the report\u2019s release, said: \u201cWe know that for lives to be saved in the future, lessons must be learnt from the mistakes of the past.\n\u201cSadly, nobody knows the true cost of the government\u2019s failure to prepare as we do.\u201d REUTERS"}
