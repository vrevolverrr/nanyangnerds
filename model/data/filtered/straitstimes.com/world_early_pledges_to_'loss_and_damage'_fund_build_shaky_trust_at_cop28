For many years, wealthy nations rejected demands to pay compensation for the impacts of their high historical share of planet-heating emissions - a stance reiterated by US climate envoy John Kerry on Thursday.\nBut last year at COP27, after three decades of pushing, developing countries and small island nations won agreement on the new fund that will pay to repair devastated property, relocate threatened communities or preserve cultural heritage before it vanishes.\nThe details of where the money will come from and go to, and how the fund will be managed, were left to be worked out by the current COP28 conference in Dubai.\nAfter much wrangling over where the fund will be housed, a compromise was reached in early November. Developed countries pushed poorer nations into accepting the World Bank as its host for an initial period of up to four years, although the fund will have an independent board.\nNew or recycled cash?\nAfter the fund was launched in Dubai, developing countries from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Iran and Vanuatu echoed the call for more contributions to the fund and demands for easy access to its coffers for vulnerable countries and communities.\nMany aid specialists also warned rich nations against taking their contributions to the new fund from budgets that would otherwise be used to pay for emergency relief in disasters or development programmes like health or education.\nMr Ian Mitchell, a senior policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, described Thursday\u2019s loss and damage pledges as \u201ctokenistic\u201d.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not additional (to aid), then they may actually be damaging for climate resilience and development,\u201d he said.\nOther proposals are under discussion for non-government sources of finance that could expand resources for the loss and damage fund, including global taxes on fossil fuels, aviation, shipping and financial trading.\n\u201cIf there was a new source of revenue for the loss and damage fund then that would be a major breakthrough for climate and development in a way that these incremental amounts are not,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.
