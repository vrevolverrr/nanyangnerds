Spain has already seen fire ravage 54,000ha of land so far in 2023, compared with 17,000ha in the same period in 2022.\nExperts say parts of the country are the driest in a thousand years, with a prolonged drought depleting reservoirs to half their normal capacity, figures show.\nOn Wednesday, at least three areas around the southern cities of Seville and Huelva recorded temperatures of 37 deg C.\nSchools adapt schedules\nThis could be Spain\u2019s hottest April on record, said Mr Ruben del Campo, a spokesman for Aemet.\n\u201cDue to its intensity and early character, this episode fits with what we are observing climate change causes,\u201d he added.\nThe Health Ministry has recommended that Spain\u2019s regions activate their heat plans \u2013 which outline measures to protect people from scorching temperatures.\nThat normally happens from June 1, but the ministry said that in 2023 they could come into effect as early as May 15, depending on the situation in each region.\nThe regional government of Madrid said metro trains in the Spanish capital would pass more frequently than usual to prevent long waits on platforms and crowding.\nIt is also considering opening some public swimming pools earlier in the year to help people cool off, and let schools adapt their timetables to avoid the worst of the heat.\nFarmland \u2018suffocating\u2019\nThe heatwave follows an abnormally warm and dry spring, spelling catastrophe for the agriculture sector in Spain, the world\u2019s biggest exporter of olive oil and a key source of Europe\u2019s fruit and vegetables.\nThe situation is so bad that some farmers have opted not to plant crops. The COAG farmers\u2019 union has warned that 60 per cent of farmland was \u201csuffocating\u201d from lack of rainfall.\nSpain on Tuesday urged Brussels to activate the bloc\u2019s agriculture crisis reserve to help farmers cope with the exceptional drought, while also announcing a series of tax breaks.\nIn 2022, Spain experienced its hottest year since records began, and United Nations figures suggest nearly 75 per cent of its land is susceptible to desertification due to climate change.\nThe number of days with summer temperatures in Spain has increased from 90 to 145 between 1971 and 2022, according to a study by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia published on Tuesday.\nPortugal was also feeling the heat with temperatures \u201c10 to 15 deg C higher than normal\u201d that could hit 37 deg C on Thursday, the weather institute said, a day after the mercury touched 35.4 deg C in the south.
