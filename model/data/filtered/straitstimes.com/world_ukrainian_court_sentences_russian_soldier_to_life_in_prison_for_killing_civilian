It has previously said that it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide assistance.\nBar set 'very high'\nUkrainian state prosecutors said Shishimarin and four other Russian servicemen stole a car to escape after their column was targeted by Ukrainian forces.\nAfter driving into Chupakhivka, the soldiers saw Shelipov riding a bicycle and talking on his phone. Shishimarin was ordered to kill Shelipov to prevent him reporting on their location, the prosecutors said.\nIn court last week, Shishimarin acknowledged he was to blame and asked the victim\u2019s widow to forgive him.\nThe court reached its verdict five days after holding its first full hearing. In contrast, the International Criminal Court has not handed down a single life sentence and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sentenced only six people to life imprisonment.\nMark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, said the verdict was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and could be the first part of \u201ca large puzzle also involving Ukrainian soldiers being held in Russia\u201d.\n\u201cIf this is the baseline trial ... it sets the bar very high,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most other war crimes cases in Ukraine I suspect we\u2019ll see similar sentences because this is the baseline trial.\u201d"}
