Apart from the A$4 billion to support new projects, it is also putting in more than A$500 million to support the construction of sites in regional areas where hydrogen can be produced, used and exported.\nMinister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen insisted the government is still committed to helping to build a green hydrogen sector but believed the fuel would mainly be used for exports and production of cement, steel, plastics and fertilisers.\nAustralia is also set to partner with Singapore on a A$20 million maritime initiative that will look at developing lower-emissions shipping and port technology involving the use of fuels such as green hydrogen and green ammonia, according to Australia\u2019s national science agency Csiro.\nGreen ammonia, which uses green hydrogen as a feedstock, is regarded as a low-emissions fuel for the maritime sector.\nSingapore also regards hydrogen as an important part of its strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\u201cGreen hydrogen will play a role in the electricity system but we have never said it would play the major role,\u201d Mr Bowen told ABC News on July 31.\n\u201cOf course, when you have a major industry under development, there are going to be things that happen more slowly than was originally envisaged.\u201d\nAn energy expert, Emeritus Professor Kenneth Baldwin, from the Australian National University, said that green hydrogen could be used to produce fertilisers and steel. It could be a key source of clean energy exports for Australia as countries gradually reduce their reliance on the nation\u2019s huge coal and gas resources.\nWhile electric vehicles were the \u201cfirst movers\u201d and so would probably not be replaced by hydrogen cars, green hydrogen could still be used for transport such as long-distance trucking, he said.\n\u201cAustralia should be doing everything it can to be an early provider of green hydrogen,\u201d he added.\n\u201cHe (Dr Forrest) was certainly an early mover, but there are projects all around Australia looking to export green hydrogen and take advantage of our enormous renewable resources. While (his) project may have been put on hold, there are many others waiting to fill that space.\u201d"}
