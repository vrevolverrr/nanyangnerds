There are many reasons for not wanting to have babies \u2013 the most pressing being the high cost of living and the amount needed to raise a child from play school to university.\nThe declining birth rate will be very difficult to reverse and leaves us with not much choice but to keep on importing foreign talent. As such, we cannot fault the Government for taking that route, no matter how unpopular it may be.\nIn one of our recent family gatherings, one of my nieces in her mid-30s told her mother not to harbour any thoughts of being a grandmother because she wishes to remain single. It would appear to me that this is the trend nowadays."}
