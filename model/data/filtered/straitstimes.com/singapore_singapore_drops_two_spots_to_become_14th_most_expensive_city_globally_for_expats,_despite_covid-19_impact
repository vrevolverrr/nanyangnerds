It also topped last year's league table.\nThe biannual survey assesses the cost of living in cities for non-local employees based on a basket of consumer goods and services such as groceries, clothing and leisure activities.\nTake a cup of coffee in a cafe: It's about US$4.44 here compared with US$5.01 in Hong Kong and US$2.87 in Hanoi.\nHouse rents, cars and school fees are not included in calculations as they are usually paid for by employers and so are unrelated to an expatriate's spending power.\nChina's two powerhouses both dropped nine places, with Shanghai at 19th and Beijing at 24th.\nMr Quane said: \"Chinese cities have all fallen ... due to signs of a weakening economy and poorly performing currency.\n\"One of the key contributing factors was undoubtedly the outbreak of Covid-19. However, it is important to note that the yuan was performing poorly before this period too, with the outbreak of the coronavirus exacerbating the relative weakness of the Chinese currency against other major currencies.\"\nSimilarly, the cost of living in South Korea has fallen due to the pandemic, with Seoul dropping from No. 8 place to No. 17, while Busan slipped out of the top 20 entirely.\nMr Quane noted: \"A quick lockdown, coupled with the high rates of infection that Korean cities saw towards the end of February, meant that confidence in the South Korean won had faltered.\" This in turns makes the cost of living cheaper for expatriates."}
