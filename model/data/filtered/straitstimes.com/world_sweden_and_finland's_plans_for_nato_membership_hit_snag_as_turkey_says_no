The ratification process had been expected to take up to a year, though Turkey\u2019s objections have thrown that into doubt.\nAt a news conference, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Sweden and Finland should not bother sending delegations to Ankara to persuade Turkey to support their bids.\n\u201cNeither of these countries have a clear, open attitude towards terrorist organisations,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cHow can we trust them?\u201d He called Sweden a \u201chatchery\u201d for terrorist organisations with terrorists in parliament.\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has shaken up Europe\u2019s security architecture and forced Sweden and Finland to choose sides after staying out of the US-led Nato alliance during the Cold War.\nSweden\u2019s Social Democrat government, worried the country will be vulnerable while its application is considered, had been hoping for a quick ratification process.\nBut Turkey\u2019s objections, which Nato leaders initially hoped would not cause a major delay, now look to present a serious obstacle.\nA spokesperson for Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde declined to comment.\nHistoric decision\nThe decisions by Finland and Sweden to apply to Nato set the two countries on a path toward ending policies of military non-alignment that had defined their defence strategies since the start of the Cold War.\n\u201cWe are leaving one era behind us and entering a new one,\u201d Andersson told a news conference on Monday.\nShe said Sweden\u2019s application could be submitted in the next couple of days and would be synchronised with Finland.\n\u201cNato will strengthen Sweden, Sweden will strengthen Nato,\u201dshe said.\nThe decision to abandon the military non-alignment that has been a central tenet of Swedish national identity for two centuries reflects a sea change in public perception in the Nordic region following Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine.\nAndersson said Sweden did not want permanent Nato military bases or nuclear weapons on its territory if its membership was approved.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin offered a mild response to the decisions, saying: \u201cAs far as expansion goes, including new members Finland and Sweden, Russia has no problems with these states \u2013 none.\u201d\nHe did however accuse the United States of using the enlargement in an \u201caggressive\u201d way to aggravate an already difficult global security situation. He said Russia would respond if the alliance moves weapons or troops forward.\nGeneral Micael Byden, commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, told a news conference the decision to apply was right from a military strategic perspective and that defending Sweden, unilaterally or in cooperation with other states, would be easier with Sweden part of Nato.\n\u201cI know, based on my conversations and the relations that I have with my counterparts, that Sweden is welcome in Nato. But we are not only welcome \u2013 I also know that Sweden as a member makes Nato stronger,\u201d Byden said.\nSweden has received assurances of support from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France but not any legally binding guarantees of military aid.\nIn a joint statement on Monday, Nordic neighbours Denmark, Norway and Iceland also pledged support.\nMoscow calls its invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to rid the country of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war."}
