He led China\u2019s delegation during ill-fated and sometimes ill-tempered climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December 2009.\nExperts say his friendly relationship with his United States counterpart Todd Stern was vital in achieving consensus between the world\u2019s top two greenhouse gas emitters, and helped get the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement over the line.\n\u201cThe role of individuals matters a great deal in climate diplomacy,\u201d said Mr Li Shuo, senior adviser at Greenpeace in Beijing.\n\u201cOver his long tenure as China\u2019s chief negotiator, Mr Xie has demonstrated that it is possible to bridge the differences between China and the West,\u201d he added.\nClimate talks between Washington and Beijing broke down during the presidency of Donald Trump, and Mr Xie quit as envoy a year later. He remained involved in building climate ties with the United States, helping set up the California-China Climate Institute with then Governor of California Jerry Brown.\nHe returned as special envoy in 2021 after the election of President Joe Biden brought the United States back into the Paris Agreement, but his friendship with Mr Stern\u2019s replacement John Kerry has not been enough to overcome rising geopolitical tensions between the countries.\nChina has repeatedly told the US that climate change is not a diplomatic \u201coasis\u201d that could be separated from broader disputes between the two sides, including US tariffs and sanctions on Chinese-produced solar panels."}
