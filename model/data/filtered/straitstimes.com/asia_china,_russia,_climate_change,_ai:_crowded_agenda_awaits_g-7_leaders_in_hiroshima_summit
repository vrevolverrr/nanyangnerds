The official Xinhua News Agency cited the report as saying China has never bullied others nor started trade wars.\nChina\u2019s accusations were not without basis. Dr Tosh Minohara, chairman of the Research Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs think-tank, told The Straits Times that the US had, in the 1980s, likewise taken aim at Japan when its economy was on the ascendancy, by accusing the country of unfair trading practices.\n\u201cIt would be interesting to see where Japan stands on China,\u201d he said. \u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s closer to Europe\u2019s position and does not want to antagonise China. But on the other hand, it is allied with the US.\u201d\nAs the G-7 leaders gathered, all of Japan was placed on high alert. Rubbish bins in major stations, not to mention vending machines, including those as far away as Ginza Station in Tokyo, were barred from use.\nPolice officers cut a dissonant presence along the rice paddy fields near Hiroshima Airport.\nDrones attached to balloons hovered above Hiroshima, with traffic on roads and highways snarled as global leaders arrived. There was a sizeable presence of sniffer dogs, while police officers dotted the streets.\nThe summit kicks off on Friday morning, with Mr Kishida welcoming his G-7 counterparts at the memorial park, where they will lay wreaths in memory of those who died after the US levelled the city with the \u201cLittle Boy\u201d atomic bomb on Aug 6, 1945.\nHiroshima is also Mr Kishida\u2019s home town and elected constituency. With relatives who died in the bombing, he has made a world without nuclear weapons his pet cause.\nYet, this remains a tall order, given that all G-7 nations have a relationship with nuclear arms. Japan, too, is protected by the US nuclear umbrella.\nBut he wants, through the summit, to push for more transparency and accountability of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads.\nUS President Joe Biden will be the second sitting US leader to visit Hiroshima after Mr Barack Obama in 2016, though he likewise will not offer any apologies for the World War II nuclear strike."}
