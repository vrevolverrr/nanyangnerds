And the President-elect has visited us, he has also put his confidence in the project.\u201d\nThe ambitious dream of moving Indonesia\u2019s capital from Jakarta to a location some 2,000km away in the middle of a forest in East Kalimantan was the signature project for Mr Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi.\nHe will step down in October after a decade in office. He made the drive to modernise the nation\u2019s infrastructure a hallmark of his administration.\nPresident-elect Prabowo pledged to continue the policies of the Jokowi administration, riding the tacit support of the popular incumbent to win almost 60 per cent of the ballots cast. His incoming Vice-President, Mr Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is Mr Widodo\u2019s son.\nThe mammoth project to relocate the capital, announced in 2019, will cost an estimated 466 trillion rupiah (S$39.5 billion). It has drawn criticism, including from Mr Prabowo\u2019s election rivals, about its environmental impact, and scepticism over whether it can attract foreign investment.\nMr Bambang said the Nusantara Capital Authority has received 369 letters of intent from interested investors to date, with most of the foreign investor pledges originating from Singapore.\nHe also said there are a \u201ccouple\u201d of Singapore companies which have shown greater commitment beyond the written pledges.\n\u201cBut I cannot disclose it at this time,\u201d he said, adding that his office typically holds three to four meetings in a day with interested parties who are not just keen to invest financially, but also to contribute in the areas of technology and renewable materials.\nHe said many delegations have asked to visit the site, from countries like Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Finland.\nIn May, more than 130 government officials and businessmen from Singapore \u2013 one of the biggest delegations \u2013 visited the 2,561 sq km site, which is about three times the size of Singapore.\nNusantara is intended to relieve pressure on Jakarta, which is vulnerable to flooding owing to heavy rainfall and land subsidence, and is beset by traffic congestion and air pollution. Greater Jakarta is home to more than 30 million people.\nBut environmentalists have warned about the destruction of forests that are home to long-nosed monkeys and orang utans, with the development of Nusantara.\nIndigenous communities around Nusantara also fear the prospect of relocation to give way to construction. Mr Bambang said they are working with all the local leaders to ensure they reach a consensus about the project.\n\u201cWe want to see the locals better off and not worse off,\u201d he added.\nNusantara plans to be sustainable and high-tech, which will take various forms in its infrastructure. Buildings, for instance, will be required to be smart and green \u2013 the first standards of this kind in the country.\nPlanning a city from the ground up has also allowed Indonesia to align itself with international goals related to climate change, sustainable development goals and biodiversity conservation, said Mr Bambang.\n\u201cWhen you have new things like that, you have an opportunity to implement all the good concepts about a city. And that allows you to put people at the heart of everything,\u201d he said."}
