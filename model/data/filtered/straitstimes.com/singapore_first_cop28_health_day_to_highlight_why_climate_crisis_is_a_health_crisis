{"title": "First COP28 Health Day to highlight why climate crisis is a health crisis", "tags": "singapore", "timestamp": "2023-12-03", "content": "Synopsis: Every first and third Monday of the month, The Straits Times analyses the beat of the changing environment, from biodiversity conservation to climate change.\nFrom heatwaves and floods triggering illness and death to air pollution from burning fossil fuels killing millions of people a year, climate change really is a global health crisis and requires urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nYet for nearly 30 years, the annual UN climate conferences, or COPs, have failed to focus on the escalating human impacts from climate change. Negotiators have focused more on cutting greenhouse gas emissions than on the link to health.\nIn this episode, ST\u2019s climate editor David Fogarty hosts Dr Maria Neira, the World Health Organisation\u2019s top public health and environment official, to talk more about the importance of such issues on the COP\u2019s first-ever Health Day.\nThey discuss why it is so urgent that nations take action now to tackle climate change and why doing so could be the ultimate public health opportunity.\nHighlights of conversation (click/tap above):\n1:06 Why is the climate crisis a health crisis? Key connections\n6:53 Why haven\u2019t UN climate talks focused more strongly on the link between climate and human health?\n9:48 Dr Maria Neira: \u201cIf we reduce the bad quality of the air we breathe every year, we could save at least 5 million lives.\u201d\n11:37 Tough action against climate change could be the ultimate public health opportunity\n13:34 Dr Maria Neira: \u201cThe moment people connect health and climate change, I think there will be an incredible increase in the sense of urgency.\u201d\nProduced by: David Fogarty (dfogarty@sph.com.sg), Ernest Luis, Hadyu Rahim & Amirul Karim\nEdited by: Hadyu Rahim\nFollow Green Pulse Podcast here and rate us:\nChannel: https://str.sg/JWaf\nApple Podcasts: https://str.sg/JWaY\nSpotify: https://str.sg/JWag\nWebsite: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\nFeedback to: podcast@sph.com.sg\nFollow David Fogarty on X: https://str.sg/JLM6\nRead his articles: https://str.sg/JLMu\n---\nDiscover more ST podcast channels:\nCOE Watch: https://str.sg/iTtE\nIn Your Opinion: https://str.sg/w7Qt\nAsian Insider: https://str.sg/JWa7\nHealth Check: https://str.sg/JWaN\nGreen Pulse: https://str.sg/JWaf\nYour Money & Career: https://str.sg/wB2m\nST Sports Talk: https://str.sg/JWRE\n#PopVultures: https://str.sg/JWad\nMusic Lab: https://str.sg/w9TX\nDiscover ST Podcasts: http://str.sg/stpodcasts\n---\nSpecial edition series:\nTrue Crimes Of Asia (6 eps): https://str.sg/i44T\nThe Unsolved Mysteries of South-east Asia (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuZ2\nInvisible Asia (9 eps): https://str.sg/wuZn\nStop Scams (10 eps): https://str.sg/wuZB\nSingapore\u2019s War On Covid (5 eps): https://str.sg/wuJa\n---\nFollow our shows then, if you like short, practical podcasts!"}
