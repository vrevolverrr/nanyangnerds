This has the potential to reduce their fear and anxiety.\nSuch apps can reduce the stress of, and load on parents and caregivers trying to get such patients to navigate the unfamiliar settings at the hospital during treatment.\nThey also give hospital staff who may not be adequately prepared for or informed about the special needs of patients an immediate tool to reach out to them."}
