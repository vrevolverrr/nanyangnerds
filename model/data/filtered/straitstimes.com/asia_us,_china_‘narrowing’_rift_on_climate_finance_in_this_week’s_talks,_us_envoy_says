The US is pressing China to pledge substantial cuts in CO2 emissions.\nThe two sides are also planning to hold a bilateral summit on abating non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane, Mr Podesta said.\n\u201cThey get less attention but they\u2019re fully half of what\u2019s causing global warming,\u201d he said.
