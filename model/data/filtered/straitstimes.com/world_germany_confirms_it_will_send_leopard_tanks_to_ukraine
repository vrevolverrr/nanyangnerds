Poland said on Tuesday that it had sought Germany\u2019s permission to send Leopard tanks from its own stocks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about very effective weapons systems here, and it\u2019s proper that we never provide those weapons systems alone, but always in close cooperation,\u201d Mr Scholz told lawmakers in Germany\u2019s Parliament.\nUkraine\u2019s allies have sought to strengthen its military without prompting Russia to further escalate the war, and some leaders had worried that battle tanks might cross that line.\nMr Scholz defended the time he took making the decision. \u201cWe always have to make it very clear in everything we do that we are doing what is necessary and what is possible to support Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time we are preventing the war from escalating into a war between Russia and Nato.\u201d\nThe German government said that it would send 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks directly from its army stock. It said it would send another similarly sized group in a second step, but did not say when, or specify where they would come from.\nThe Leopard 2, first introduced in 1979, is used by 13 European armies, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations, and together these militaries have an estimated 2,000 vehicles.\nIt is one of the world\u2019s leading battle tanks and would offer a big step forward in capability for Ukraine, which has been using Soviet-era tanks.
