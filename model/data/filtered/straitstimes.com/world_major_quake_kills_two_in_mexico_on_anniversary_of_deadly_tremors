Videos on social media showed the roof of the mall collapsed into the top floor, a gym, as people yelled for help.\nAuthorities also reported damage to several hospitals in the western state of Michoacan near the epicentre which was in a sparsely populated part of Mexico.\nThe quake hit shortly after 1pm (1800 GMT) near Mexico\u2019s west coast and close to Michoacan\u2019s border with the state of Colima \u2013 where major port Manzanillo is located, the US Geological Survey said.\nIt was relatively shallow, at only 15km deep, which would have amplified its impact.\nThe US Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas, saying waves reaching 1m to 3m above the tide level were possible.\nMexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said there were no immediate reports of major damage in the capital after the tremors, which rumbled through Mexico on the same day as destructive quakes battered the country in 1985 and 2017.\n\u201cIt seems like a curse,\u201d graphic designer Isa Montes, 34, in the city\u2019s central Roma neighborhood, said of the quake\u2019s timing as helicopters flew overhead, surveying the city.\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico, one of the country\u2019s most prestigious seats of higher learning, said there was no scientific explanation for three major quakes on the same day and attributed it to pure coincidence.\nBut others could not quite believe it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this date. There\u2019s something about the 19th,\u201d said Mr Ernesto Lanzetta, a business owner in the Cuauhtemoc borough of the city.\n\u201cThe 19th is a day to be feared.\u201d\nThousands of people were killed in the Sept. 19, 1985 earthquake and more than 350 died in the Sept. 19, 2017 quake.\nMany Mexicans reacted to the latest quake by posting an array of memes online venting their amazement.\nBefore first announcing the death in Manzanillo, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had said there was material damage near the epicentre.Images posted on social media showed buildings badly damaged.\nMexican authorities said the seismic alert had sounded nearly two minutes before the quake struck, giving residents time to evacuate their homes.\nStill, some people in the capital struggled to grasp it was a real quake as the government had already sounded the alarm earlier in the day as a practice exercise commemorating the past earthquakes on the same day.\nMs Clara Ferri, who owns an Italian bookshop in Roma, said she told a customer to get out as soon as she heard the windows rattle, her senses attuned to the sounds of incipient earthquakes after 16 years in the location.\n\u201cIt was like the dentist\u2019s drill for me,\u201d she said.\nThe rumbling grew in intensity, and as Ms Ferri gathered with neighbours at an intersection, she looked up to see the eight-story building that houses her shop sway from side to side.\nWhen she returned, shelves had toppled like dominos, sending over 1,000 books into heaps on the floor.\nOfficials roped off the sidewalk, which was littered with masonry that appeared to have fallen off the building.\nResidents trickled out with pets and suitcases, preparing to spend the night elsewhere, and a woman carefully escorted her 89-year-old uncle in his blue-and-white striped pajamas.
