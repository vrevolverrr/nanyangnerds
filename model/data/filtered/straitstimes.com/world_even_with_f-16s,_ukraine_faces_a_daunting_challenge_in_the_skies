Minutes after it relayed targeting data back to a Russian base, a barrage of ballistic missiles struck the airfield, said Ukrainian officials, recounting the episode.\n\u201cThat first hit was so powerful that even our windows were trembling,\u201d said Ms Valeria Minenko, 21, who lives near the airbase in Myrhorod, central Ukraine, one of many targeted in relentless attacks by Russia in recent months.\n\u201cNow they\u2019re hitting the airbase with the rockets all the time,\u201d Ms Minenko said.\nRussia has been saturating the skies over Ukraine with surveillance drones, exploiting gaps in air-defence systems, to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks on Ukrainian positions.\nIts dominance in the air along parts of the front has allowed it to bombard Ukrainian positions with hundreds of powerful guided bombs every day, helping its ground forces to make slow and steady gains.\nUkraine\u2019s strategy was to counter Russia in the air war with the aid of long-coveted F-16 fighter jets from the West that it says it will deploy this summer.\nBut the assaults on Ukrainian airbases underscore Russia\u2019s determination to limit the impact of the planes even before they enter the fight. They also highlight the challenges Ukraine faces as it prepares to deploy the sophisticated aircraft for the first time.\nUkraine is hoping the F-16s, which come with powerful electronic warfare systems and an array of other weapons, can be used in coordination with other Western weapons like Patriot air-defence systems to expand the area considered too dangerous for Russian pilots to fly.\nThey also hope the jets will add another layer of protection for Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure from relentless missile and drone attacks.\nBut a shortage of trained pilots and a limited number of jets will constrain the immediate impact, experts say.\n\u201cRussia has had so much time to fortify its defences, especially along the front-line areas,\u201d said Mr Hunter Stoll, a defence analyst at research organisation Rand. \u201cThe F-16s and their pilots will face stiff resistance from Russian air defences, both on the ground and in the sky.\u201d\nUkraine says it is \u201cin the process\u201d of moving the first F-16s into the country, about 2\u00bd years after it first pleaded for the aircraft. It has been a year since the Biden administration finally reversed policy and allowed Western allies to transfer American fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\u201cToday, we can already say clearly, we have entered the club of countries that have F-16s,\u201d Mr Yuri Ihnat, a representative for the Ukrainian Air Force, said in an interview. \u201cThis is a turning point for our nation.\u201d\nThe arrival of the planes \u2013 the exact number has not been publicly revealed \u2013 comes at a moment of deep uncertainty in the war.\nRussian forces are engaged in furious assaults all along the 966km front, the Ukrainian energy grid is crippled by years of unrelenting bombardment and a presidential election in the United States could reshape future military assistance.\nIn addition to the Russian attacks on the Ukrainian airfields, Ukraine will also be constrained by the small number of trained pilots, according to Ukrainian and US military officials. About 20 airmen in the various US, Dutch and Danish training pipelines are expected to be ready in 2024, according to US officials.\nAir commanders say they typically allot at least two pilots per aircraft \u2013 for crew rest, training and other matters. So that would allow Ukraine to fly only about 10 F-16s, at most, on combat missions in 2024.\nAnother major limiting factor, officials say, is the number of trained maintenance and support personnel on the ground to keep the F-16s flying.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the pilots you have to have,\u201d General Charles Brown Jr, chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and a long-time F-16 pilot, said in June. \u201cMaintenance is also a key part of that, and training the maintainers.\u201d\nGeneral Serhii Holubtsov, chief of aviation of Ukraine\u2019s air force, said Ukrainians \u201cdo not wear rose-coloured glasses\u201d and understand that the F-16 is \u201cnot a panacea\u201d.\nThe strategy, he told Donbas Realiy, a branch of Radio Liberty, can be thought of in three phases \u2013 \u201ccrawl, walk, run\u201d \u2013 and it will take time.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t learnt to crawl yet,\u201d he said.\nBefore the jets can start to play a role in shaping the battlefield, Ukraine needs to be sure they can be protected.\nWhile Russia has been attacking Ukrainian airfields since the first hours of the war, the early July attack on Myrhorod was different, Ukrainian officials said.\n\u201cThe enemy came up with a new tactic,\u201d Mr Ihnat said.\nSpecifically, he said, the Russians are improving missiles and reconnaissance drones, \u201cmaking it so that we cannot influence them with electronic warfare\u201d.\nThey are also preprogramming surveillance drones to fly deep into Ukraine without emitting telltale electronic signatures, making them harder to detect.\nGeneral Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, said this past week that Ukraine urgently needed to find new methods of destroying enemy drones.\nMr Ihnat said that the Ukrainian Air Force had effectively adopted deception tactics \u2013 like building model planes to act as decoys, camouflaging aircraft and moving them \u2013 to protect its depleted fleet of Soviet-era aircraft, and would do the same for the F-16s.\n\u201cIf someone wants to laugh at this, let them,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks to the models, the enemy has already lost dozens or even hundreds of their missiles.\u201d\nUkraine is also employing 1970s-vintage Yakovlev Yak-52 training planes to hunt Russian surveillance drones, he said.\nThe propeller-driven aircraft have been hunting Russian surveillance drones across southern Ukraine, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces posting videos of the aerial clashes.\nGen Holubtsov said he expected attacks on the airfields to increase. For that reason, he said, Ukraine will not keep all the promised F-16s in the country.\nPresident Vladimir Putin of Russia has said that the storage abroad of planes or other Ukrainian military assets could \u201cpose a serious danger of Nato being drawn further into the conflict\u201d.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s approach to arming Ukraine has been driven in large part by concerns about potential escalation with Moscow, which is why it resisted allowing the transfer of F-16s from allies for so long.\nRetired Lieutenant-General David Deptula, the dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Washington, said the delay \u201chas given Russia the gift of time\u201d.\n\u201cWe gave them time to dig in and establish defences that are now much more difficult to unravel,\u201d he said.
