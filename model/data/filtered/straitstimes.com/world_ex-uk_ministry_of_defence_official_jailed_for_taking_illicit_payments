Its sole business was to provide communications systems to the Saudi Arabian National Guard under a contract with the MoD.\nProsecutors had alleged Cook and Mason were at the heart of \"deep corruption\" as part of which bribes of more than 9.7 million pounds ($12.1 million) were paid to Saudi officials and intermediaries between 2007 and 2010.\nCook and Mason, however, said the British government approved millions of pounds of payments because they were in the country's financial and strategic interests.\nTom Allen, representing Cook, said senior British officials, politicians and diplomats knew and consented to payments totalling nearly 60 million pounds from 1978 onwards.\nCook was found guilty of one count of misconduct in public office, relating to payments received when he worked for the MoD and before he joined GPT.\nJudge Simon Picken sentenced him to 30 months in prison, saying his offending was so serious that only an immediate jail sentence would suffice.
