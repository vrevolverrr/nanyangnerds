Grok to ensure voters have accurate information in this critical election year,\u201d the letter said.\nThe letter was signed by the secretaries of state of Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Washington, and New Mexico. In some American states these officials are responsible for overseeing elections.\nThe chatbot wrongly told users that the ballot deadline had passed for nine states. The message effectively implied that Ms Harris was not eligible to replace Mr Biden on the ballot.\n\u201cThis is false. In all nine states the opposite is true,\u201d the letter said.\n\u201cThe ballots are not closed, and upcoming ballot deadlines would allow for changes to candidates listed on the ballot for the offices of president and vice-president of the United States.\u201d\nX did not respond to AFP\u2019s request for comment.\nThe letter added that Grok continued to repeat this false information \u2013 which was amplified by multiple posts, reaching millions of people \u2013 for more than a week until it was corrected on July 31.\n\u201cAs tens of millions of voters in the US seek basic information about voting in this major election year, X has the responsibility to ensure all voters using your platform have access to guidance that reflects true and accurate information about their constitutional right to vote,\u201d the letter said.\nIn what is widely billed as America\u2019s first AI election in November, researchers warn that AI-enabled misinformation could be used to manipulate voters, stoking tensions in an already hyperpolarised environment.\nLast week, Mr Musk faced a firehose of criticism for sharing with his followers an AI deepfake video featuring Ms Harris.\nIn it, a voiceover mimicking Ms Harris calls Mr Biden senile before declaring that she does not \u201cknow the first thing about running the country\u201d.\nThe video, viewed by millions, carried no indication that it was parody \u2013 save for a laughing emoji. Only later did Mr Musk clarify that the video was meant as satire.\nResearchers voiced concern that viewers could have falsely concluded that Ms Harris was deriding herself and sullying Mr Biden.\nX, which researchers say has scaled back content moderation efforts and reinstated once-banned accounts of known misinformation spreaders, has also faced criticism for stoking tensions during recent far-right riots across England.\nOn Aug 4, Mr Musk triggered fresh criticism for posting that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in response to another user blaming the riots on \u201cthe effects of mass migration and open borders\u201d.
