Li Auto added more than 3 per cent in Hong Kong, while Nio climbed as much as 6.1 per cent. Top battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology rose 1.1 per cent before paring its gain to just 0.1 per cent as of 10.46am, Singapore time.\nThe announcement follows a June 2 Cabinet meeting during which the authorities said they would extend and optimise the tax exemption and study policies to promote NEV development.\nThe incentives put NEVs, a mainstay of big-ticket spending, on the front burner of a broad-based push to rekindle growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nThe government heavily promoted NEVs in recent years to curb air pollution, through incentives that supported the rise of local players such as Li Auto, Nio and BYD.\nNEV sales suffered a hit earlier in 2023 after the government ended a more than decade-long subsidy for EV purchases, but bounced back after automakers including Tesla cut prices to defend market share and after the previous extension of the purchase tax exemption.\nWednesday\u2019s announcement is the fourth extension. The tax break was announced in 2014 and extended in 2017, 2020 and 2022.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce launched a Green Cars Going Rural campaign last Thursday to promote EV adoption, particularly in the countryside, while the State Council and other agencies have called for stabilising car consumption and building charging infrastructure.\nDeliveries of EVs and plug-in hybrids in China rose about 41 per cent from January through May, according to the country\u2019s Passenger Car Association, much slower than the 120 per cent growth for the same five-month period of 2022.\nNew cars are generally subject to 10 per cent sales tax, but that has not applied to clean-energy vehicles since 2014, a policy recently extended through 2023. Wednesday\u2019s announcement pushes that date back to the end of 2025 for clean cars under 300,000 yuan that do not seat more than nine people, while cars under 150,000 yuan will get further support to the end of 2027.
