At current trading levels, the yen has weakened nearly 11 per cent against the Singdollar to date this year.\nThe BOJ decision was in line with market expectations but some investors were on the lookout for signs on whether the doveish central bank might signal an eventual move away from negative interest rates.\n\u201cThe BOJ will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary,\u201d the BOJ said in a statement at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting.\nMarket focus now turns to BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s press conference later in the day for further guidance on the bank\u2019s policy outlook.\n\u201cBefore the meeting, there were expectations for policy changes, including wording amendments in the statement,\u201d said SMBC chief FX strategist Hirofumi Suzuki.\n\u201cThe movement of a weaker (yen) is unlikely to become a trend, partly because expectations remain for a policy revision for January-March next year.\nElsewhere, the US dollar languished near roughly five-month lows against the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars, as market sentiment stayed buoyant on the prospect that the United States Federal Reserve could begin easing in 2024.\nThe Aussie edged 0.28 per cent higher to US$0.6725, having peaked at US$0.6736 in the previous session, its highest since July 31.\nThe kiwi likewise rose 0.22 per cent to US$0.62255, standing not too far from Monday\u2019s top of US$0.6250.\nWhile some Fed officials have pushed back against market expectations of how soon the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) could cut rates, those comments have done little to sway market pricing and stem the greenback\u2019s decline.\nChicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee on Monday said the Fed is not pre-committing to cutting rates soon and swiftly, and the jump in market expectations that it will do so is at odds with how the US central bank functions.\n\u201cIt may take (the) PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation or comments from FOMC chair (Jerome) Powell to encourage market participants to delay their expectations for the start of the rate cut cycle,\u201d said Mr Joseph Capurso, head of international and sustainable economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nA reading on the core PCE price index \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of underlying inflation \u2013 is due this week, providing further clarity on whether inflation has slowed sufficiently for the Fed to begin easing its monetary policy in 2024.\nThe pound rose 0.03 per cent to US$1.2651, while the euro slipped 0.04 per cent to US$1.0919.\nMr Capurso said those two currencies are the most vulnerable to a dislocation in oil and gas markets given their increasing dependence on energy from the Middle East, after the Yemeni Houthi militant group attacked ships in the Red Sea.\nThose attacks led to a spike in oil prices as investors worried about disruption to trade as well as supply costs.\n\u201cMiddle East oil and gas supplies may be put at risk,\u201d added Mr Capurso. \u201cThat\u2019s why the euro and sterling are most at risk for big falls if these conflicts get worse or spread.\u201d REUTERS"}
