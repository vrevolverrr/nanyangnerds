We sat it out in cellars. We went through everything it is possible to go through. We absolutely cannot say we feel safe,\" Liubov Sinna, 74, told Reuters on Wednesday.\nIzyum, a town of 50,000 before the war, became a strategic supply hub for one of Russia's principal front lines in its invasion and sustained an extraordinary amount of damage that has made normal life a struggle for residents.\nSmashed windows, pock-marked facades and scorched walls lined a battle-scarred main thoroughfare comprised of deserted meat shops and pharmacies and ruined beauty salons.\nA forlorn handwritten sign on a front door read: \"People live here.\"\n\"It's survival. There's no light, no gas, no water. We make bonfires to cook. That's how we live,\" said Bohdan Solomko, 43, walking home with his wife Oksana and their three children.\n\"Most important is the kids are alive,\" he said.\nResidents described a hellish six months since they first took shelter in the basements of apartment blocks in early March, just days after Russia launched its invasion. They made fires to keep warm from the bitter cold and fetched pails of water from wells.\nThere were no available figures for the number of people left but the population had evidently plunged. Stray dogs - perhaps abandoned by fleeing owners - scampered around in the destruction.\nFew buildings were unscathed on a parade of shops leading to the main square where President Volodymyr Zelensky oversaw a ceremony to raise the Ukrainian flag on Wednesday.\nThousands of Russian troops fled Izyum at the weekend, leaving behind large amounts of ammunition and equipment, their worst defeat since they were driven back from the outskirts of Kyiv in March.\nAnton Gerashchenko, an aide to the interior minister, said authorities were only now beginning to launch investigations and were unable to provide figures for civilian loss of life in the town. \"We're only just beginning.\"\n'Gates of the Donbas'\nOn the road to Izyum, bus stops were daubed with \"Z\"markings, the symbol Russian forces use to identify themselves, and the charred remains of tanks and armoured personnel carriers lay by the road side.\nThe discarded wrappers of Russian army food rations were littered on the ground at a checkpoint now held by Ukrainian troops on the way into the town.\n\"We waited a long time for our guys. Of course we feel positive. (It's) joy. But there is also fear - fear that the Russians could return here,\" Sinna said.\nShe said the town stood at the \"gates of the Donbas\", the eastern region whose entire capture Russian President Vladimir Putin has talked up as a key war objective.\nBut there had been a lot of deserters among the Russian forces in the town, said Sinna.\n\"They went away in groups, through the pedestrian bridge to get to Kupiansk. They changed into civilian clothes and went. Most of them left in the night between Sept 8 and 9. On the 10th, we knew the city was free,\" she said.\nThe fall of Izyum is widely seen as a major setback for Moscow's assault on the Donetsk region, which along with Luhansk makes up the Donbas. Parts of the area are controlled by Russia and separatists it backs, but swathes remain in Ukrainian hands.\nSolomko, whose hands were filthy from cooking over an open fire, said he was undaunted.\n\"We're not afraid any more, we've got used to it. You can't explain it in a few words. You'd have to put my coat on and walk around here for a bit,\" he said.\nOksana said: \"The children say they can breathe easier and the fear has passed.\""}
