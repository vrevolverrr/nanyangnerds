We are able to keep Singapore safe, we are able to deal with the current crisis,\" he said.\n\"And so long as this Government is able to maintain our reputation for openness, transparency, reliability, I think we are still on the right track.\"\nSeveral MPs, such as Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson), Mr de Souza, and Workers' Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) had asked on Tuesday how the police would handle the data used for criminal investigations."}
