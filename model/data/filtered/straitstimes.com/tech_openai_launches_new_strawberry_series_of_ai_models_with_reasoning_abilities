OpenAI has now automated this capability, so the models can break down problems on their own, without user prompting.\n\u201cWe trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies and recognise their mistakes,\u201d OpenAI said.\nReuters was the first to report OpenAI\u2019s work on the reasoning project, then called Q*, in November 2023. It reported in July that the project had come to be known as Strawberry. REUTERS"}
