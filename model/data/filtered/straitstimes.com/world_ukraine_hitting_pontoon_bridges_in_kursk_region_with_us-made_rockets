Operators... accurately destroy them,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Special Operations Forces said on Telegram messenger.\nThe statement said US-manufactured Himars rocket systems were used. It was the first official statement from Kyiv that Western weapons are part of the unprecedented offensive.\nWashington has made no direct comment regarding the use of US-made weapons in the Kursk region, while saying its policies had not changed and that Ukraine was defending itself from Russia\u2019s attacks.\nWhile allies have barred Ukraine from conducting long-range strikes with Western weapons inside Russia, they have allowed Kyiv to use them to hit border areas since Russia's new offensive on Kharkiv region this spring.\nThe Kremlin says the use of US-made weapons inside its territory is an escalation.\nThe video posted by special forces showed strikes on several pontoon crossings. At least one strike appeared to be conducted with cluster munitions.\nReuters could not independently verify the statement and video.\nThe video clip also showed drone strikes on military trucks and other locations described as a munitions warehouse and an electronic warfare complex.\nReuters has been able to verify at least one pontoon crossing that seems to have been destroyed.\nIt was likely set up between Aug 14 and 17 linking the Russian settlements of Zvannoe and Glushkovo after two bridges were destroyed or damaged earlier.\nThe crossing, some 14km from the border, was gone by Aug 19, satellite imagery showed. Smoke was also visible in images from the area that day.\nWhile Kyiv has reported a string of battlefield successes since it crossed unexpectedly into Russia\u2019s Kursk region on Aug 6, Moscow has pressed forward on the front line in eastern Ukraine, 2\u00bd years since its full-scale invasion.\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry has said in recent days that its forces have taken control over several settlements in the area, including Zhelanne and Svyrydonivka, as well as the town of Niu York, some 46km from Pokrovsk.\nUkraine\u2019s military has not directly commented on these claims while reporting heavy fighting in the areas.\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry has said the advance in the Kursk region made bigger gains than Russia had captured since the start of 2024.
