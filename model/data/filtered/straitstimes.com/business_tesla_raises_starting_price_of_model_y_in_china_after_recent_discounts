The shares were bouncing off a 65 per cent plunge in 2022.\nRiskier growth stocks, which were beaten down hard last year amid concerns about rising interest rates and a recession, have made a strong comeback in 2023 as optimism about the economy has returned and investors bet that the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive rate hike cycle is nearing its end.\nAt the same time, Tesla\u2019s own earnings last month, and a spate of positive headlines on tax credits for EVs, have provided further lift to the shares of the company led by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\u201cTesla is rising so fast because of a market that believes the Fed is coming to the rescue,\u201d said Mr Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based private equity firm Patriarch Organisation. Good fourth-quarter results and \u201cprice cuts to turbocharge demand\u201d also helped, he added.\nEarly in February, the Biden administration said it will expand the newly revamped EV tax credit to allow SUVs costing up to US$80,000 (S$106,250) to receive those credits. That move is a positive for Tesla, analysts said.\nSeparately, the company has seen a surge in demand for its cars after January\u2019s big price cut, allowing it to institute a slight price hike.\nStill, Tesla\u2019s gains of 68 per cent this year far outpace those of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which is up 13 per cent, as well as that of the NYSE FANG+ Index, which has advanced 28 per cent in 2023.\nA frenzy of speculative trading in recent weeks that has seen retail traders rush into some of their favorite stocks can explain some of that exuberance, given Tesla\u2019s popularity among individual shareholders.\n\u201cTesla has definitely been the main target of retail buying so far this year,\u201d said Mr Marco Iachini, senior vice-president of research at Vanda Securities. While retail investors buying the stock is not unusual, given that Tesla is \u201can ultimate retail favourite\u201d, Mr Iachini said the persistence and magnitude of the flows are surprising.\nGiven that Tesla\u2019s sharp decline over the past year brought significant pain to mom-and-pop traders, the recent \u201chunger\u201d for the stock could be due to a desire to chase it higher and make up for losses, Mr Iachini said.\nJust this week, Tesla alone attracted a 33 per cent share of overall net purchases across all US securities, according to Vanda.\nThe heavy retail flows into the stock are coming ahead of the company\u2019s investor day on March 1, when Mr Musk is expected to unveil a third version of his \u201cmaster plan\u201d, Vanda analysts noted.\nDespite January\u2019s gravity-defying rally, the EV maker\u2019s shares are still down 49 per cent from the all-time high of US$409.97 touched in early November 2021. While some investors say that the worst could be over for Tesla, others advocate caution, especially with the risk of a recession still hovering and the EV industry\u2019s brisk pace of growth expected to slow in the near term.\nMeanwhile, scepticism about the company\u2019s newest model, the Semi heavy-duty truck, is continuing to linger.\nThe stock is now trading just above the average analyst price target tracked by Bloomberg \u2013 suggesting that Wall Street does not see much more upside. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s relative strength index, a technical gauge that measures whether a stock is under- or over-bought \u2013 shows signs of excessive buying, typically seen by markets as an indication that a decline is imminent.\nTesla shares can continue to rise until the end of the first quarter or early second quarter, when \u201csigns of a potential hard landing may again slash valuation\u201d, Patriarch\u2019s Mr Schiffer said.
