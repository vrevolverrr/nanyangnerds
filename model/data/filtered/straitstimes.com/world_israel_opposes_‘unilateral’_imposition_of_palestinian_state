An accord, should it be reached, will only come through direct negotiations between the sides, without preconditions.\u201d\n\u201cIsrael will continue to oppose the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. Such recognition in the wake of the Oct 7 massacre will grant a huge, unprecedented reward to terrorism and prevent any future peace accord,\u201d it said. REUTERS"}
