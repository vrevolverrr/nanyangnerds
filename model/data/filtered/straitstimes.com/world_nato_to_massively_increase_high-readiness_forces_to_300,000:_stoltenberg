We regret that \u2013 but of course, then we need to respond to that reality,\u201d he told reporters.\nThe June 28-29 summit comes at a pivotal moment for the alliance after failures in Afghanistan and internal discord during the era of former US President Donald Trump, who threatened to pull Washington out of the alliance.\nBut Russia\u2019s February invasion of Ukraine has sparked a geopolitical shift, prompting once neutral countries Finland and Sweden to apply to join Nato and Ukraine to secure the status of candidate to join the European Union.\nStoltenberg said Nato would transform its existing quick reaction force, the Nato Response Force, which already has some 40,000 troops on high readiness, and raise the overall number to \u201cwell over 300,000\u201d.\nThe move is part of Nato\u2019s work on a new force structure that will likely see national troops put on different alert levels so the alliance has more combat-ready forces ready on short notice in case of a crisis.\nAt the summit, Nato will also change its language on Russia from the current wording, enshrined at its Lisbon summit in 2010, describing Moscow as a strategic partner.\n\u201cI expect the allies will state clearly that Russia poses a direct threat to our security, to our values, to the rules-based international order,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\nNato combat units on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank, especially in the Baltics, are to be boosted to brigade level, with thousands of pre-assigned troops on standby in countries further west like Germany as rapid reinforcements, he added.\n\u201cTogether, this constitutes the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defence since the Cold War,\u201d he said.\nAt the same time, Stoltenberg dampened hopes for a break-through at the summit to overcome Turkey\u2019s opposition to the membership bids of Sweden and Finland.\n\u201cI will not make any promises or speculate about any specific time lines, The summit has never been a deadline,\u201d said Stoltenberg, who is scheduled to meet the leaders of all three countries in Madrid on Tuesday."}
