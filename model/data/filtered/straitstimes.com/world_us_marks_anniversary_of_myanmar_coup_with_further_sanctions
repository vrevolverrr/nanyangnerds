Civilians have often been targeted in the war.\nThe US Treasury Department said in a statement it targeted the Shwe Byain Phyu Group of Companies, its owner Thein Win Zaw, his wife and two adult children.\nThe US Treasury said the company imports and distributes petroleum for the military, and has a profit-sharing relationship with military conglomerate Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MFHI), which Washington imposed sanctions on in 2021.\nMEHL-owned shipping firm Myanmar Five Star Line, which Washington said ships materials for domestic weapons production for the military, was targeted too.\nThe Treasury Department said the two entities have enabled the purchase of foreign currency and the import of petroleum and other materials on behalf of the junta.\n\u201cWe are taking this action to target the regime\u2019s sources of revenue that support military activities against civilians,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement, reiterating Washington\u2019s call for the military to change course.\nMyanmar has been locked in conflict since the military seized power in a coup on Feb 1, 2021, that sparked nationwide chaos and abruptly ended a decade of tentative democracy and economic reform.\nThe sanctions, which freeze any US assets of those targeted and generally bar Americans from dealing with them, come as junta leader Min Aung Hlaing is under pressure after a series of battlefield defeats that have seen rebel groups take control of at least 35 towns since October.\nThe generals are facing their biggest challenge since first taking control of the former British colony in 1962, with a youth-led pro-democracy uprising morphing into an armed resistance movement after a lethal crackdown on a wave of protests and post-coup dissent.\nThe junta has deployed heavy artillery and fighter jets to try to suppress militias allied with a shadow government and ethnic minority armies, several of which launched a coordinated offensive in October that stunned the military and has dented its battlefield credibility.\nAbout 2.3 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations, while efforts by Myanmar\u2019s South-east Asian neighbours to initiate dialogue have seen no progress.\n\u201cThe United States, along with our allies and partners, will continue to hold accountable those who seek to profit from, and provide support for, the violent oppression of the people of Burma,\u201d Treasury\u2019s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said, using the old name for Myanmar.
