They said, however, that key details, including the per-barrel level of the cap would be determined later \u201cbased on a range of technical inputs\u201d to be agreed by the coalition of countries implementing it.\n\u201cToday we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally,\u201d the ministers said.\nThe provision of Western-dominated maritime transportation services, including insurance and finance, would be allowed only if the Russian oil cargoes are purchased at or below the price level \u201cdetermined by the broad coalition of countries adhering to and implementing the price cap.\u201d\nOleg Ustenko, a senior economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, welcomed the development, and said he expected the price range to be between US$40 and US$60.\n\u201cThis is fantastic. It\u2019s exactly what we needed\u201d to reduce the revenues that Russia was collecting, he told Reuters. Brent crude futures rose 66 cents to US$93.02 a barrel on Friday.\nZelensky himself, in a video address, said a cap should also be imposed on Russian natural gas exports.\nA senior US Treasury official said the coalition would set a dollar price limit for Russian crude and two others for petroleum products \u2013 not discounts to global market prices. The cap would be revisited as needed.\nThe G-7 ministers said they would work to finalise the details in time to launch by Dec 5, when new European Union sanctions initiate a ban on Russian oil imports.\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner, the current G-7 finance chair, said the price cap on Russian oil exports was designed to reduce President Vladimir Putin\u2019s revenues.\n\u201cAt the same time, we want to curb rising global energy prices. This will minimise inflation globally,\u201d he said.\nOil cutoff threat\nThe Kremlin responded by saying it would stop selling oil to countries implementing the price cap, saying it would destabilize global oil markets.\n\u201cWe simply will not cooperate with them on non-market principles,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\nNonetheless, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Russia would still have an economic incentive to sell oil at or near the cap, because otherwise it would have to shut down production that would be difficult to restart. China and India also would seek to buy oil at the capped price, she added.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire injected a dose of reality, telling his G-7 counterparts that more work was needed to work out technical details, persuade a critical mass of importers to join the plan and preserve European unity on the subject, his office said in a statement.\n\u201cWe got positive signals from other countries, but no firm commitments yet,\u201d a senior G-7 source said of efforts to recruit other countries. \u201cWe wanted to send a signal of unity towards Russia and also countries like China.\u201d\nThe G-7 announcement had little effect on benchmark crude prices, which rose in anticipation of an Opec+ discussion of output cuts on Monday amid weaker demand.\nEnforcing the cap would rely heavily on denying London-brokered shipping insurance, which covers about 95 per cent of the world\u2019s tanker fleet, and finance to cargoes priced above the cap. But some analysts say alternatives could be found to circumvent it.\nThe G-7 ministers said they would seek to limit circumvention through \u201ca record-keeping and attestation model covering all relevant types of contracts\u201d that aims for consistent enforcement across jurisdictions."}
