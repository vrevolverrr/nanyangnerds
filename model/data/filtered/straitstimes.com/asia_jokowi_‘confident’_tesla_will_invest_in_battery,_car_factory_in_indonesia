It currently manufactures EVs in four locations: Fremont, California; Shanghai; Austin, Texas; and outside Berlin.\nAnalysts estimate that Tesla would need to build seven or eight more \u201cgigafactories\u201d to meet Mr Musk\u2019s target of selling 20 million electric vehicles by 2030.\nIn addition to Indonesia, South Korea, Canada and Mexico have been vying for Tesla to invest in manufacturing.\nA spokesman for Mexico\u2019s president said on Tuesday that Tesla was considering setting up an assembly plant near a new Mexico City airport.\nAnalysts have said Mexico could have an edge to win the Tesla investment because of the proximity to its main market in the United States, an established supply base for components and because vehicles built there could qualify for Biden administration consumer tax credits.
