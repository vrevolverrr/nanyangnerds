She said she frequently brings members of the LGBTQ community with her, to meet the pontiff as he greets the crowd.\nAsked by the newspaper about the pope's reported use of the gay slur, Jeanningros said that, among her friends, \"at first there was a bit of pain, but looking back they had a laugh and said, really, he's not like that\".
