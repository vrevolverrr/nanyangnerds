Don\u2019t you need your sons?\n\u201cTake them away from us! Let them return to their wives, to their children, to their mothers! Let them leave us forever, not just for 36 hours\u201d.\n\u2018I stay with my city\u2019\nAFP journalists in Bakhmut heard incoming and outgoing artillery fire for more than an hour after the 36-hour ceasefire was due to take effect on Friday, though shelling was lighter than in recent days.\nThe streets of the bombed-out city were mostly empty save for military vehicles.\nSoldier Volodymyr Morozov told AFP he didn\u2019t even know about Mr Putin\u2019s ceasefire call, which coincides with Orthodox Christmas on Saturday.\n\u201cThis is the first time I have heard about the ceasefire \u2013 from you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t watch the news before and I don\u2019t watch it now either. All the news I\u2019m interested in is concerning my comrades.\u201d\nRussia and Ukraine have both suffered heavy casualties in the fight for Bakhmut. Most of the city\u2019s pre-war population of 70,000 have left for safer territory, fleeing the cratered roads and buildings reduced to rubble and twisted metal.\nYet some families remain, a point of frustration for police officer Pavlo Diachenko, who spent Friday distributing leaflets advertising a shelter in Chernivtsi, a city in western Ukraine, which he said would even accommodate pets.\n\u201cSeveral days ago, a woman left with her daughter, as well as a family with three children and a dog,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAlmost no one else wants to go,\u201d he admitted, but he predicted that more would end up leaving as winter temperatures drop further.\nVolodymyr, a 49-year-old municipal worker who came to the aid centre with his 14-year-old daughter, said he had no plans to leave.\n\u201cIf there is a ceasefire, then it will be quiet for 36 hours. Nothing else,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the city \u2013 I love it... I stay with my city.\u201d\nA makeshift Christmas\nThe aid centre offers a rare place for Volodymyr and others still in Bakhmut to escape the basement shelters where they spend most days.\n\u201cThey are from the neighbourhood, they don\u2019t want to sit in the basement, so they come here to socialise and to communicate, to rest from the constant stress,\u201d said volunteer Denys Murachov.\nOn Friday, the centre organised an impromptu Christmas Eve celebration around what Ms Scherbak, the other volunteer, described as a \u201csymbolic Christmas table\u201d of snacks and sweets.\nIn one corner, a Christmas tree had been dressed with garlands and a single string of flashing lights.\nMs Scherbak lamented that she could not greet visitors with \u201ca glass of homemade vodka\u201d and kutya, a sweet grain pudding, as she would in peacetime.\nNevertheless \u201cwe will give people a drop of home warmth... as much as we can now,\u201d she said.\nWith dozens of Bakhmut residents gathered around the table, Ms Scherbak offered a Christmas wish, speaking over artillery booms that reverberated outside.\nBehind her, a muted television showed footage from the battlefield.\n\u201cAs you know, Christmas is a time of salvation. We wish you salvation,\u201d she said.\nShe gestured to the table stacked with mandarins, apples and cookies. \u201cWe did what we could,\u201d she said. AFP"}
