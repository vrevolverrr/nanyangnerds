This response masks the odours of our body that normally attracts biting insects,\u201d she said\nMs Teh added that another group from the University of California, Davis, found mosquitoes have olfactory receptor neurons that can detect repellents such as Deet, and avoid it by flying away from the source of the smell.\nWhile concerns have been raised about the safety of Deet, repellents containing the chemical are generally safe if used as directed, said Mr Tan.\nHe pointed to recommendations by the American Academy of Paediatrics that repellents with Deet be applied sparingly and as directed, with concentrations of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent for children above two months old, and up to 50 per cent for adults.\n\u201cConcerns about Deet primarily revolve around potential skin irritation or allergic reactions, as well as safety concerns regarding prolonged or excessive exposure, particularly in children,\u201d he noted.\nMr Tan said that while there have been environmental concerns about Deet entering water bodies through wastewater, it is not \u201coverly toxic\u201d to wildlife such as fish and waterbirds.\nHe added that there is little to no harm of secondary or tertiary consumers being affected, referring to animals that eat other animals that may have consumed Deet.\nSuch concerns about the chemicals used in commercial repellents have led some to seek natural repellents \u2013 including those containing ingredients such as citronella or lemongrass oils \u2013 as safer alternatives.\nBut are they effective?\nThe NEA website states that studies have shown that repellents containing Deet, picaridin or IR3535 are more effective and have longer mosquito-repelling effects than natural repellents.\nOne study by researchers from New Mexico State University, which was published in the Journal of Insect Science in October 2015, compared commercially available natural repellents against those containing Deet.\nThe study found that while mosquitoes were strongly repelled by all products containing the chemical, the products that used natural repellents showed mixed results.\n\u201cWhile natural repellents may offer some protection against mosquitoes, their effectiveness and duration of protection may vary compared (with) chemical alternatives like Deet or picaridin,\u201d said Mr Tan.\n\u201cAdditionally, natural repellents need to be reapplied more frequently to maintain efficacy,\u201d he said.\nThe least effective products are ultrasonic repellent devices, which purport to use high frequency tones to repel the insects, said Ms Teh.\nWhile these are popularly found on e-commerce sites, studies have disproved their effectiveness, she said, citing the American Mosquito Control Association, which notes on its website that at least 10 studies have \u201cunanimously denounced ultrasonic devices as having no repellency value whatsoever\u201d.\nFogging \u2013 where an insecticide designed to kill adult mosquitoes and their larvae is combined with water and sprayed in the air \u2013 is one way of controlling the mosquito population in Singapore.\nHowever, this method is not suitable for indoor environments as potentially dangerous fumes are emitted during the process, said Mr Tan.\nAccording to the NEA website, fogging is to be carried out only when there is a mosquito nuisance problem or disease outbreak.\n\u201cFogging is also not recommended as the only treatment method, as fogging only kills adult mosquitoes present at that time, and also insects that prey on them,\u201d said Mr Tan, adding that these mosquitoes often just fly off to nearby areas while fogging is being conducted.\n\u201cIt is better to focus the attention on removing mosquito breeding sources through maintenance and housekeeping, and relying on other more sustainable methods instead,\u201d said Ms Teh.\nShe suggested home owners could also consider installing mosquito screens on their doors and windows, describing it as an effective long-term method.\nOther effective ways of keeping mosquitoes away include wearing long-sleeved clothing and trousers, and avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito activity times (dawn and dusk), said Mr Tan.\n\u201cIf unsure, it is best to bring in trained pest professionals to ensure that there are no breeding sites and get a customised treatment plan with long-term effectiveness as we have access to professional tools and solutions that are not available to the public,\u201d he added.\nSimply Science is a new fortnightly series looking at the science behind everyday questions."}
