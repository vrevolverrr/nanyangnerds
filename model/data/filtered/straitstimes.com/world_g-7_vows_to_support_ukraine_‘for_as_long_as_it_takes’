But, at intervals, they launch significantly fewer rockets and keep people in shelters. What is this if not terror?\u201d he said on national television.\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine\u2019s sixth-largest city, apartment blocks have been struck overnight at least three times in the past week, killing civilians while they slept.\nIn an overnight video address from the scene of one of the attacks in Kyiv, Mr Zelensky promised that Ukraine would keep fighting.\n\u201cWe will do everything to strengthen our armed forces. We will make the battlefield more painful for the enemy,\u201d he said. REUTERS, NYTIMES"}
