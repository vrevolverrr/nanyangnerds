We have Muslims, we have non-Muslims. Do we trust each other or not?\u201d\nHe said the Government worked with the Malay/Muslim community, religious teachers and community groups to talk openly about the issue, and guard against people becoming radicalised.\nIt is fortunate that no terrorist attack has taken place in Singapore so far, he said, adding that going through the experience of handling the terror threat \u201chas helped to bring us closer together\u201d.\n\u201cBut to say after this, we can fly solo \u2013 the Government does not need to watch, can take hands off the steering wheel or the controls, and it will look after itself \u2013 I do not think so. Never,\u201d said PM Lee.\n\u201cIt is not possible, because these issues are forever sensitive ones, and you need to have limits to the discussion; you need to have the tone set by the Government.\u201d\nIf the Government does not make major moves, for instance on the tudung for nurses or decriminalising sex between men, \u201cit is not going to happen, or it is going to happen in a very chaotic and very contentious way\u201d, he added.\nPM Lee said the most difficult issue, and a long-term challenge, is managing the inherent tensions between wanting social cohesion among Singaporeans and being open to immigrants and foreign workers.\n\u201cIf we want Singapore to grow, then we have no choice but to work very hard to find ways we can have our cake and eat most of it. And that is a continuing, long-term challenge.\u201d\nStronger national identity\nPM Lee said he has \u201cno doubt\u201d Singapore\u2019s national identity is stronger today after 20 more years of nation-building.\nThe country has weathered crises such as the global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic in that time, he noted.\nHowever, strengthening national identity is always hard work because the macro environment will pull different ethnic groups in different directions from time to time.\n\u201cThere have been these challenges in the last 20 years, and there will definitely be similar challenges in the future,\u201d he said.\nSocial safety nets\nAsked what is to stop Singapore from moving towards a welfare state as it seeks to become more inclusive, PM Lee said this would entail the Government spending about 45 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and raising about 40 per cent of that via taxes, like some European countries.\n\u201cIn Singapore, we do not collect 40 per cent of taxes in GDP, we do not spend 45 per cent of GDP on social and other government programmes,\u201d he said, noting that the Republic collects about 15 per cent of GDP in tax and spends between 18 per cent and 19 per cent.\nPM Lee said Singapore\u2019s goods and services tax (GST), at 9 per cent, is very low compared with the 20 per cent or 25 per cent that is imposed in other developed countries and welfare states, plus other taxes on income, wealth and goods like petrol.\n\u201cSo for us, the constraint is that if you cannot afford it, and if you are not prepared to pay for it, then we cannot have it.\u201d\nIf social benefits or coverage are to be improved, then adjustments have to be made from time to time to raise revenue, he added.\n\u201cWe have to be able to afford it to spend it,\u201d he said, noting that the GST had to be raised from 7 per cent to 9 per cent to pay for steadily rising healthcare expenditure.\nWhile the opposition may make calls to \u201cjust take a bit more\u201d from the reserves, PM Lee said the amount of spending required for a welfare state model means that \u201cthe reserves, however ample, will be gone very soon and that will not do\u201d.\nIn the absence of a constituency or political party in Singapore that calls for lower taxes and less welfare, the Government has to judge which social safety nets are necessary and wise to have, he said.\nHe noted that Singapore has moved very far towards better social safety nets in the past 20 years, citing schemes such as ComCare, Workfare and the Progressive Wage Model.\n\u201cIt is very considerable. Of course, people will always say \u2018please do more\u2019 and we will keep on improving.\u201d\nHowever, doing too much will weaken Singapore\u2019s competitiveness and economic viability, he said.\nSingaporeans should work hard and be prudent. If things turn out well, everybody can enjoy the upside, he added.\nSingapore\u2019s communities\nSingapore\u2019s ethnic Chinese have never been a unified collective, said PM Lee.\nThe Chinese community is diverse, also comprising Peranakans and new immigrants, he noted.\nCommunity organisations must move with the times, to cater to the needs of the era, he said.\nIn the past, Chinese clan associations set up schools and helped new immigrants settle in Singapore and find jobs. Today, they can help promote culture, education, or build trade ties with China.\nPM Lee noted that the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry has attracted new directors every term, including young people and those who are not from traditional companies.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I see the Chinese community keeping pace with the times,\u201d he said as he urged the community to work together to create opportunities for Singapore.\nOn the Malay/Muslim community, he noted that 80 per cent of Malay students go on to post-secondary education today, and about 20 per cent graduate from university. This is a big improvement from 20 years ago, and will continue to improve, he added.\nThe proportion of Malay professionals, managers, executives and technicians has also risen. \u201cThese are wins which happen quietly, year by year, bit by bit, and you may not notice it, but I think we should be proud of it,\u201d he said.\nHe noted that the community still has issues with incarceration rates, drug abuse numbers and dysfunctional families, which are being addressed via programmes like ComLink+. Groups like Mendaki and AMP Singapore will help the community to progress further, he added.\nTurning to the Indian community, he said it has been doing well too. Groups like Sinda have some very active and passionate volunteers who are making a big difference to families who need help, he said.\nOne issue he flagged is between Indians who are Singaporeans and newly arrived Indians, some of whom naturalise while others do not.\n\u201cYou are not the same, and therefore you have to find ways to bridge that gap with each other. And that is something which is continuing work,\u201d he said.\nOutside of India, Singapore has the biggest concentration of graduates from the top institutions in India \u2013 the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management.\nSingaporeans notice the influx because the numbers are not small, but these are talented people who are a tremendous plus to Singapore, he said.\n\u201cI think we should welcome them, as we manage the flow,\u201d he added.\nIsrael-Hamas conflict\nPM Lee said he completely understands why Muslims in Singapore have become very distressed about the conflict in Gaza.\n\u201cIt is unconscionable, it is inhuman, really... but there is also a religious element to this feeling,\u201d he said.\nBut rather than do something performative, such as holding a demonstration or burning flags, there are practical ways to help, he added.\nSingapore has raised donations, with the Singapore Red Cross going to Egypt to help to deliver the contributions. It also collected and purchased food and medical necessities, and air-dropped them from a Republic of Singapore Air Force C-130 plane, flying from Jordan over Gaza.\nRacism\nSingapore started off with the founding ideal to be one people, regardless of race, language or religion.\nThe country has gone very far in that direction \u2013 racism is less seen here than in most other countries, said PM Lee. \u201cWe will work to make it better.\u201d\nBut to make prejudice disappear completely between different human groups who are going to remain different, while keeping alive cultures, heritages and religions will be very hard, he added.\nPM Lee said the Government will take more steps to reduce racism, citing the workplace discrimination legislation it is working on.\nOnce in a while, there will be incidents where someone says something outrageous that riles up everyone, and action must be taken.\n\u201cYou have to react \u2013 either punishment must follow according to the law, or at least stern disapproval must be expressed, and the leaders must take a stand,\u201d he said.\nBut these are things that require judgment and perspective, as overreacting to a small incident would be unwise as it risks getting everyone hyped up.\nSocial media\nSocial media is one way of fostering interest in politics among the youth, said PM Lee, who has a Facebook account and an Instagram account.\nOn how social media helps him connect with the people, he said it reaches a different audience.\n\u201cPeople who follow my posts like my pictures, know when I jalan-jalan (go on walks), may not read my speeches or listen to my rallies, but it is an audience. And then when I post something else, hopefully it will turn up on that feed and they may take notice and maybe read it.\u201d\nIn a crisis, people pay attention to social media posts, he added, recounting how his posts were very well followed during the Covid-19 pandemic as people were anxious and wanted to know what was happening.\nHe said he will continue to update his social media accounts after stepping down as prime minister.\n\u201cI hope the new leaders and PM will grow their following on social media,\u201d he said.\nReferring to his successor, DPM Wong, PM Lee said: \u201cHe may not be into photography, but his guitar-playing skills are not bad.\u201d\nPM Lee noted that DPM Wong and ministers such as Mr Chan Chun Sing, Mr Desmond Lee and Mr Ong Ye Kung have TikTok accounts. He considered but decided against starting one, as he felt there was nothing he could not already convey on his existing accounts.\n\u201cI think TikTok would be for the next generation of ministers. At least, it interests the people in the personalities, maybe a little bit in the content and hopefully encourages them to think more deeply about what this is about,\u201d he said."}
