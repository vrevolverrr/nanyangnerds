This makes them vulnerable to starvation and disease, and many die. This can lead to the collapse of fragile reef ecosystems, with coastlines left unprotected from erosion and storms and fisheries falling short.\nAn El Nino climate pattern, borne out of warmer-than-usual surface waters in the Eastern Pacific, alongside human-caused climate change, is fuelling the extra heat.\n\u201cWhat is more surprising is that sea surface temperatures are at record levels over regions far away from the centre of the El Nino action, such as the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean,\u201d said climate scientist Richard Allan from the University of Reading.\nThis, he said, pointed to the strong influence of rising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.\nWhile the global average sea surface temperature record excludes the polar oceans, things are in bad shape there, too.\nAntarctic sea ice reached its annual minimum extent in February, registering its third lowest extent on record at 28 per cent below average."}
