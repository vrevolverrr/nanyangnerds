They were nothing more than \u201cgood friends\u201d and she never abused her power to orchestrate promotions or pay increases for him, according to new legal documents filed in an Ontario court.\nCanada\u2019s biggest bank sacked Ms Ahn in April after an investigation sparked by an anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s complaint about the alleged relationship. The former CFO, who has 25 years of experience at the bank, filed a wrongful dismissal lawsuit in August.\nThe bank fired back a week later, alleging it has more than a decade of communications between Ms Ahn and Mr Mason proving the two had an intimate relationship that they failed to disclose. RBC claimed the colleagues used pet names, swopped romantic poetry, celebrated anniversaries and met outside of work for drinks.\nRBC has \u201cselectively quoted\u201d communications between the former colleagues, Ms Ahn\u2019s lawyer, Mr Mark Fletcher, said in a separate statement on Sept 5. \u201cThere is no policy against workplace friendships and that\u2019s all this was.\u201d\nAn RBC spokesperson declined to comment on her new filings and referred to the bank\u2019s previous responses. Lawyers for Mr Mason, who is also suing for wrongful dismissal, did not reply to a request for comment. BLOOMBERG"}
