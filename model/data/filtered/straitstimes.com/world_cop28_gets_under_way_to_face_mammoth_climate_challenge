He added that the world has been taking baby steps to tackle accelerating climate change instead of the sprint that is needed.\n\u201cThis has been the hottest year ever for humanity,\u201d he said. But there were clear choices that could be made to make the world safer.\nNations must decide to fund the green transition properly, including through financing for irreparable losses and damage suffered by the poorest and most vulnerable nations to worsening storms, floods, droughts and rising sea levels that are stunting their economies.\nOn Nov 30, delegates adopted a loss and damage fund, with the World Bank the interim trustee and host of the fund\u2019s secretariat. The fund has long been a key demand of vulnerable nations devastated by natural disasters linked to global warming.\nAfter years of dragging their feet on the issue, wealthy nations backed the fund in a landmark agreement at the COP27 summit in Sharm El-Sheikh in 2022. Negotiations during 2023 on the structure of the fund, who was eligible to receive financial support and who would host it have been fraught.\nThe UAE and Germany said on Nov 30 that they would each commit US$100 million (S$133 million) to the fund. Britain also pledged up to \u00a360 million (S$101 million), the United States US$17.5 million, and Japan US$10 million.\nHost UAE is also hoping COP28 will agree on a tripling of global renewable energy output by 2030. Achieving this will need trillions of dollars, especially for developing nations.\nA key but increasingly threatened goal is to limit average global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a guardrail of the 2015 UN Paris climate agreement.\nThe 1.5 deg C limit could be breached in less than a decade, scientists say, based on current emissions levels, and exceeding this limit risks far more extreme weather disasters and faster sea-level rise.\nUnderscoring the growing risks, data to the end of October showed that 2023 was already around 1.4 deg C above the pre-industrial baseline, the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said on Nov 30 in its provisional 2023 State of the Global Climate report.\nIt said 2023 is set to be the hottest ever recorded, with extreme weather leaving \u201ca trail of devastation and despair\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deafening cacophony of broken records,\u201d said WMO chief Petteri Taalas. \u201cGreenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record high. Sea level rise is record high. Antarctic sea ice is record low.\u201d\nCOP28 president Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber has called on delegates to ensure an ambitious outcome. But Dr Al Jaber, who is also the UAE\u2019s Special Envoy for Climate Change and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, has courted controversy for his role as the head of Abu Dhabi\u2019s national oil company.\nHe has faced a storm of criticism, with accusations that an oil boss should not be leading a major climate conference, especially when the UAE is investing heavily to boost oil and gas output.\nAt the opening ceremony, he implored delegates to be willing to compromise. He also called for consensus around a framework for the future energy system.\n\u201cI know there are strong views about the idea of including language on fossil fuels and renewables in the negotiated text. We have the power to do something unprecedented,\u201d he said.\nAt the vast COP28 venue, the site of the 2020 World Expo, scores of nations have built their own colourful pavilions to showcase their efforts on climate action, to network and to announce deals.\nIt is all part of how UN climate conferences have changed over the years, turning into giant trade fairs.\nSingapore on Nov 30 launched its pavilion, which aims to promote the Republic\u2019s steps to tackle climate change, achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and showcase the growing number of partnerships with other nations, businesses and academia in the climate and sustainability space.\n\u201cThe Singapore Pavilion will bring together global leaders from diverse sectors and professions to foster collaboration,\u201d Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in a video address at the pavilion\u2019s opening.\n\u201cIt is here that we hope to forge new partnerships and accelerate climate actions together.\u201d\nMr Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said the pavilion\u2019s programme will span three main themes: decarbonisation, finance and resilience.\nThese refer to steps to cut emissions from across industries; financing the green transition, including innovative financing measures that blend public and private money; and building resilience to climate impacts, such as boosting coastal defences, better drainage and steps to bring down the temperatures of cities.\n\u201cOur contribution to climate action is not just to remove the 0.1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions that we account for,\u201d Mr Menon said at the opening ceremony for the pavilion. \u201cMore importantly, it is to collaborate with partners from around the world to galvanise resources and incubate and scale solutions for climate action.\u201d"}
