This means that he will be detained in a centre and made to follow a strict regimen that includes foot drills and counselling.\nThe Singaporean youth pleaded guilty on July 13 to four counts of having sex with a minor. He also admitted to one count of assaulting the 18-year-old girl. The offender turned 21 later that month.\nSeventeen other charges, mainly relating to sexual acts with the underage girls, were considered during sentencing. He committed the offences between 2017 and last year.\nThe three victims cannot be named due to a gag order, while the youth cannot be identified as he was just 16 years old when he started committing the offences.\nHe was in a relationship with the 15-year-old girl from January to August 2017.\nThe girl was a virgin before she met him but the pair later had sex up to three times a month. She discovered she was pregnant in early 2018 and gave birth soon after.\nThe offender got to know the 12-year-old girl through social media platform Instagram in January 2019.\nThey met for the first time at his home on Jan 19 that year and had unprotected sex. The pair then got into a relationship later that day.\nOn April 30, 2019, the girl was found to be about 10 weeks pregnant and had an abortion the following month.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Theong Li Han had earlier said: \"The production of conception was obtained and sent to the Health Sciences Authority for paternity testing.\n\"The result shows that the probability of paternity towards the accused was 99.9999 per cent.\"\nSome time in June that year, the youth spent the night at the girl's home and they had sex again.\nThe DPP added: \"The accused did so as he assumed that (the girl) would not get pregnant since she had just had an abortion in May 2019. The accused did not use a condom.\"\nThe court heard that the offender was in a relationship with the 18-year-old girl from August 2019 to September last year.\nSome time in January last year, the couple had a dispute outside his home as he did not want her to leave the unit. Its location was not revealed in court documents.\nThe offender then slapped the teenager once and kicked her lower back.\nTwo months later, the girl discovered she was pregnant with his child and gave birth in July last year.\nHis bail was set at $15,000 on Friday and he was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on Dec 17 to begin serving his sentence.\nFor having sex with a child below 14 years old, an offender can be jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned."}
