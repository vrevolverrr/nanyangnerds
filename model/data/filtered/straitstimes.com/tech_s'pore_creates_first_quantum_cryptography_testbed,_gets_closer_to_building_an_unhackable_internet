These tests simulate day-to-day operations in the hope of deploying them one day to securely process sensitive functions, including the operation of energy grids and e-banking transactions. Target users include those in the medical, finance and military sectors.\n\"Today's encryption methods are unlikely to withstand future attacks based on quantum computing technology,\" said Assistant Professor Charles Lim, who is the lead principal investigator for the project.\nThe National Quantum-Safe Network will be financed by NRF's Quantum Engineering Programme, first announced in 2018, with a funding of $8.5 million over three years. The testbed is expected to be up and running by the end of this year (2022).\nQuantum computers rely on theoretical particle physics and run on subatomic particles such as electrons in sub-zero temperatures.\nUnlike conventional computers - which store information in a binary \"0\" or \"1\" format called bits - quantum computers use \"qubits\" that can represent both a \"0\" and a \"1\" simultaneously. This is said to allow them to process information significantly faster than ordinary computers, and therefore crack encrypted data more easily.\nFor example, Japan's first prototype quantum computer, unveiled in 2017, could make complex calculations 100 times faster than a conventional supercomputer.\nIn 2019, Google created a quantum computer that could perform in 200 seconds a computation that would take the world's fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years.\nProf Lim, who works at the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said quantum cryptography requires the use of specialised hardware such as quantum key distribution systems.\nQuantum key distribution is a process where secret keys are exchanged between intended users of encrypted data. Such keys are used to unlock the algorithm securing the data, so that it can be read.\nIf unauthorised parties intercept the data stream, the intended users will be notified to delete the stolen key, rendering the data unreadable to the hacker.\nThese systems can be deployed over existing fibre-optic networks, which have already blanketed homes and offices in Singapore providing fibre broadband connections.\nQuantum key distribution systems can also be deployed over satellite systems, but the project will focus on fibre broadband connections for now."}
