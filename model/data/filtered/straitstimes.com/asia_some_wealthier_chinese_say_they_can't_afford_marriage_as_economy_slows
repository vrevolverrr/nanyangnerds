Local governments have also announced various measures to encourage new families, including tax deductions and housing subsidies, as well as cash \u201crewards\u201d for marriages if the bride is aged 25 or younger.\nMs Julia Meng, whose company Julia\u2019s Events organised the Shanghai singles event, said an increasing number of people aged 35 and older had effectively \u201cgiven up\u201d on marriage.\nYounger Chinese, like event attendee Jack Jiang, say they want to get married, but high housing prices, uncertain job prospects and the general economic situation is not helping.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we want to be single, it\u2019s the urban structure, economic situation that have led to this result,\u201d the 32-year-old entrepreneur said.
