They have all been recovered. Three of them are fine, two of them are unfortunately in a relatively serious condition and obviously we will be monitoring that condition,\u201d Defence Minister James Cartlidge told Sky News.\nThe British Army later wrote on social media platform X that the injured horses, named Vida and Quaker, were operated upon on April 24, with one transferred to an equine hospital.\nThe other horses involved are \u201cbeing closely observed\u201d but are expected to return to duty \u201cin due course\u201d, it added.\nSeven horses and six soldiers from the Household Cavalry were on an extended exercise in Belgravia, near the regiment\u2019s barracks off Hyde Park, when the chaos erupted on the morning of April 24.\nFour service personnel were thrown from their horses, with five of the animals bolting and four getting loose, reportedly after they were spooked by concrete being moved by builders hitting the ground.\nTwo horses then ran along busy roads, dodging buses, taxis and other traffic.\nThree of the unseated soldiers were taken to hospital but all are expected to make a full recovery, the army posted on April 25.\nA number of prestigious army cavalry regiments have stables in the British capital and horses are a regular sight around government buildings on Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, The Mall and in nearby Hyde Park.\nMr Cartlidge stressed that the events on April 24 were \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d to be repeated.\n\u201cYou are probably aware that the army has horses out on exercise in central London every day of the week. It is about 150 horses on average exercising every day,\u201d he told LBC radio.\n\u201cSo this is extremely unlikely, this scenario.\u201d\nLondon Ambulance Service said it was called at 8.25am local time to reports of a person being thrown from a horse on Buckingham Palace Road.\nTwo of the horses were recaptured by the City of London Police, which polices the Square Mile financial district.\nOfficers contained two animals while \u201can army horse box had collected the horses and transported them to veterinary care\u201d."}
