The 171-page book assesses the national approach to dealing with nature on land, and will be launched on April 28.\nPrimatologist Andie Ang, who led the project with Herpetological Society of Singapore co-founder Sankar Ananthanarayanan, said Mandai forest and Tagore forest in Lentor were deemed by the conservationists as green spaces that should be prioritised for consideration as nature parks.\nDr Ang, who heads Mandai Nature\u2019s primate conservation and Singapore programmes, said: \u201cIf Tagore forest is no more, the Raffles\u2019 banded langur loses a significant portion of its habitat.\u201d\nThe Republic\u2019s population of the shy, leaf-eating monkey plunged to a worrying low of 10 in the 1980s, but has been making a gradual comeback with intervention from the authorities and organisations in Singapore and Malaysia, the only countries it can be found in.\nDespite optimism that the monkey\u2019s numbers will grow to more than 150 here within the next two decades, the loss of unprotected habitat, like Tagore forest, poses the greatest threat to the species\u2019 recovery, researchers found in 2023.\nThe forest is set to make way for future housing, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority\u2019s (URA) latest master plan that guides Singapore\u2019s development in the medium term.\nSimilarly, part of Mandai forest, which is located next to Singapore\u2019s animal parks, has been earmarked as a potential site for development.\nEcologist Lam Weng Ngai at NTU\u2019s Asian School of the Environment, who co-wrote the book, said the part of Mandai forest dominated by local trees holds high conservation value because its system can absorb large amounts of planet-warming carbon, as well as shelter and feed native animals and plants.\nLeopard cats, sambar deer and pangolins are among such wild animals that have been sighted there.\nWhile the forest has been disturbed in the past by various factors like the construction of kampungs, if the area is left to recover, it can mature and increase in diversity and store more carbon over time, said Dr Lam.\nHe said: \u201cNative species-dominated forest patches like those in the Mandai area are extremely valuable because they are habitats for a diverse array of native plants and animals, have the most promising ecological trajectories and are predicted to store the most carbon in the long run.\u201d\nBird Society of Singapore president Keita Sin, who also contributed to the book, said the forest patches have hosted birds that are reliant on more mature forests in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and they have also used these habitats to travel.\nIn northern Mandai, for instance, tiny populations of the brown and dusty blue short-tailed babbler have been sighted, he added.\nMr Sin said: \u201cGiving (these sites) a nature park status will protect them from potential developments.\u201d\nHowever, the writers have stopped short of calling for these spaces to be transformed immediately into parks.\nSaid Dr Ang: \u201cGiven the various land use needs in Singapore, it would be idealistic to turn all forested areas into nature parks.\n\u201cIn order to identify key areas that are potentially important for the preservation of nature and biodiversity in Singapore, we should first study and understand the areas better, before recommending their uplisting as nature reserves.\u201d\nResponding to queries from The Straits Times about the recommendation, the URA and National Parks Board (NParks) said in a joint statement that statutory boards work closely with one another to \u201cprioritise key biodiversity areas and enhance ecological connectivity upfront\u201d in long-term plans.\nThey said NParks takes a science-based approach to strengthening connections used by wildlife to travel across the island based on the ecological profiling exercise, which mapped how vegetated plots around Singapore are linked to one another.\nThe authorities added: \u201cHowever, given our physical constraints, there will be some greenfield sites (places that have not been previously built on) that we have to develop to meet our land use needs.\n\u201cAny decision to proceed is made only after detailed study of the trade-offs and alternatives, including the assessment of ecological and biodiversity value.\u201d"}
