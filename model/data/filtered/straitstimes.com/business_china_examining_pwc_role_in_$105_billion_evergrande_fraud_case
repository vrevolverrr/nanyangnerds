They are in contact with some former PwC accountants who handled Evergrande\u2019s audit, one of the people said.\nNo decision has been made on whether to penalise the auditor, said the people, adding that officials are still investigating other suspected crimes of Hui, who was detained in 2023. PwC declined to comment.\nBeijing\u2019s fresh revelations of Evergrande\u2019s fraud come at a difficult time for PwC, which is dealing with the fallout of scandals in other parts of its global network, and has cut jobs from Britain to Canada. The firm\u2019s practice in Australia \u2013 which is also slashing jobs \u2013 came under fire for leaking confidential government tax plans to clients. PwC\u2019s British arm was hit with a \u00a35.6 million (S$9.5 million) fine in 2023 for failures in its work on Babcock International Group\u2019s books.\n\u201cThere are serious questions about PwC\u2019s role in the Evergrande fraud, specifically what it knew about the improper revenue recognition,\u201d said Mr Nigel Stevenson, an analyst at accounting research firm GMT Research in Hong Kong.\nGMT has previously questioned the accuracy of Evergrande\u2019s financial reporting, and alleged in December 2023 that the developer may have never been profitable. In response, Evergrande said the research firm\u2019s recent report was \u201cwithout basis\u201d.\nBy inflating revenue, Hengda also overstated a total of 91.9 billion yuan (S$17.3 billion) in profit, or more than three-quarters of its reported income between 2019 and 2020, according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. That is about 20 times the inflated profit at Enron\u2019s 2001 scandal, which ultimately brought down its auditor Arthur Andersen.\nPrior to 2021, Evergrande recorded revenue from contracted sales of many projects before completing and delivering the homes to buyers. Its aggressive revenue-recognition tactics enabled the developer to report lower liabilities and leverage ratios during those years, which facilitated its sales of domestic and international bonds. The world\u2019s most indebted developer began having cash flow problems in 2021 and spiralled into default, imperilling millions of apartment units that it had pre-sold to buyers but had not completed.\nWhile Chinese regulators laid much of the blame on Evergrande\u2019s Hui, their allegation could create legal trouble for PwC. Evergrande is currently going through liquidation proceedings in Hong Kong, and liquidators that are trying to recover money for the company\u2019s creditors may go after deep-pocketed PwC for compensation, according to several lawyers and insolvency practitioners, who asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.\nThe regulator\u2019s fine of 4.18 billion yuan on Hengda also means Evergrande will have even less money to pay off its creditors. The Chinese developer was saddled with about US$332 billion in liabilities as at June 2023.\nThe Chinese authorities have previously come down hard on accounting firms for lapses in their audits of domestic companies. In 2023, the Ministry of Finance slapped a record 212 million yuan fine on Deloitte\u2019s China unit and suspended the operations of its Beijing office for three months for \u201cserious audit deficiencies\u201d in its work on state-owned China Huarong Asset Management between 2014 and 2019. The bad-debt manager received a US$6.6 billion bailout in 2021 after reporting massive losses.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian, a Shanghai-registered firm that is part of PwC\u2019s global network, was Hengda\u2019s auditor during the period in question. PwC was Evergrande\u2019s auditor for more than a decade until the global accounting firm resigned in January 2023, due to what the developer said were audit-related disagreements.\nPwC\u2019s onshore arm, with more than 1,600 certified accountants, reported revenue of 7.9 billion yuan in 2022, making it the top earner among more than 9,000 local rivals, according to official data. Still, that is a fraction of its global revenue of US$50.3 billion during the year.\nAmong the Big Four accounting firms, PwC was one of the most commonly used by Chinese real estate firms listed in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It audited the books of some of the nation\u2019s largest developers, including Country Garden Holdings and Sunac China Holdings, before they also defaulted on their debt.\nOver the past two years, however, PwC has resigned from at least 10 Chinese property companies including Sunac and Shimao Group Holdings, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t aware that Evergrande was doing anything different from the rest of the industry,\u201d said Mr Tyran Kam, head of China property at Fitch Ratings. \u201cBased on the information available to us, Evergrande\u2019s revenue recognition and other accounting policies were generally perceived to be similar to the accounting practices to many of its listed peers,\u201d he added.\nThat said, while many Chinese developers have stated in their annual reports similar revenue-recognition policies, Evergrande may have pushed the limits further.\nPwC is also being investigated by Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Reporting Council in 2021, after it failed to identify Evergrande\u2019s inability to operate as a going concern. The inquiry by the city\u2019s accounting watchdog was on Evergrande\u2019s 2020 annual accounts and 2021 interim report.\n\u201cThe issue is that the auditing process is fundamentally broken, conflicted and, at times, corrupted,\u201d said Dr Tom Kirchmaier, professor at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cHence, the problem might be bigger than PwC.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
