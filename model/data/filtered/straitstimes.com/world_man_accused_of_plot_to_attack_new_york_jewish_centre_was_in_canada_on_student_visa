The visa was issued the month before.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, Khan began posting his support for ISIS on an encrypted messaging application in November 2023. He allegedly communicated his attack plans to undercover agents.\nMiller said he had no further comment on Khan's case because criminal charges were pending.\n\"We take any security breach and any entry into Canada very seriously,\" he said. \"Let's not be naive: A determined individual can gain access to this country and that is for the security services inside our country to apprehend this person if they commit a crime or if they're about to commit a crime. And that's exactly what happened.\"\nCanada approved more student visas in May and June 2023 than in any month since at least January 2019, according to data from the immigration department. Approvals have since fallen.\nCanada has been seeking to reduce its ranks of international students, issuing a two-year cap in January.\nKhan is set to appear in court in Montreal on Sept. 13.
