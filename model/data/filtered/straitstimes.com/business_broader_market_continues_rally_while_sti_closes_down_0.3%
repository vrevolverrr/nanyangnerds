A rekindled risk appetite now has investors devouring all things China, from equities to currency.\n\u201cWhile still short on the granular details, this is as close as Beijing gets to guns blazing,\u201d he said.\nHe added that this bullish tide has spilled over into global equities and risk sentiment elsewhere, resulting in Wall Street\u2019s three key indexes all heading north overnight.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.6 per cent and the S&P 500 inched up 0.4 per cent."}
