Just like we entered Karabakh, just like we entered Libya, we might do similar to them.\"\nHe did not spell out what sort of intervention he was suggesting.\n\"Erdogan is following in the footsteps of Saddam Hussein and threatening to attack Israel. He should remember what happened there and how it ended,\" Katz said in the statement.\n\"Turkey, which hosts the Hamas headquarters responsible for terrorist attacks against Israel, has become a member of the Iranian axis of evil, alongside Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen,\" he said.\nOnce close regional allies, relations between Israel and Turkey have been deteriorating for more than a decade.\nBilateral trade weathered many diplomatic storms, reaching billions of dollars a year, but Turkey this month said they would halt all bilateral trade with Israel until the war ends and aid can flow unhindered into Gaza.
