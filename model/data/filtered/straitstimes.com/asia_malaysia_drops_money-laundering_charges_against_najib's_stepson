Steps would be taken to ensure a full acquittal upon completion of the deal, failing which charges could be reinstated, lead prosecutor Gopal Sri Ram said during the hearing.\nThe US Department of Justice has said Red Granite financed three films, including The Wolf Of Wall Street, using funds they suspect were stolen from 1MDB.\nRed Granite paid the US government US$60 million in September 2017 to settle a civil forfeiture claim over the rights to the films. The United States has returned or assisted Malaysia with recovering around US$600 million from the sale of assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds.\nSince losing an election to Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's coalition in 2018, Najib has been slapped with 42 criminal charges tied to losses at the now-defunct 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty and has consistently denied wrongdoing.\nThe case has also led to scrutiny of Goldman Sachs, which Malaysia has accused of misleading investors over bond sales totalling US$6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for 1MDB. Three units of the bank have pleaded not guilty.\nREUTERS"}
