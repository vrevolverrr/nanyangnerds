IBF offers accredited courses that support upskilling in the listed areas.\nMr Gan said Singapore\u2019s financial sector has to navigate an \u201cincreasingly complex and tumultuous\u201d environment. Some challenges that the local financial market will have to face include intensifying geopolitical contestation, climate change and disruptive technologies.\nDomestically, tighter manpower and resource constraints will also make it harder for Singapore to achieve the next bound of growth, said Mr Gan.\nNevertheless, there remain opportunities for Singapore\u2019s financial sector to grow.\nSingapore can serve as a financing hub for global businesses looking to expand into Asean and support the region\u2019s transition to net zero. The Republic can also support the growth of Asean\u2019s digital economy.\n\u201cSingapore\u2019s digital-enabled firms and highly digitalised financial services sector will be in a good position to participate in the fast-growing digital economy,\u201d Mr Gan added.\nTo that end, Singapore must continue to build a strong pipeline of local talent for the financial sector, he said.\nSpeaking at the same event, Mr Chia Der Jiun, chairman of IBF Council, said that as financial institutions navigate \u201cwinds of change\u201d, the tripartite partnership between IBF, trade unions and financial institutions will remain important in supporting workforce transformation.\n\u201cThe concerted and proactive approach to skills, talent and workforce development has supported the growth and success of Singapore\u2019s financial sector, which in turn creates more job opportunities for the local workforce,\u201d said Mr Chia, who is also a managing director at MAS.\nTen financial institutions were presented with special-edition IBF Golden Jubilee awards by Mr Gan to commemorate IBF\u2019s 50th anniversary and to honour their commitment to skills and workforce development.\nAmong those that were conferred the award were insurance company AIA, which received the IBF Golden Jubilee Advance (Skills Development) Award, and DBS, which received the IBF Golden Jubilee Inspire Award."}
