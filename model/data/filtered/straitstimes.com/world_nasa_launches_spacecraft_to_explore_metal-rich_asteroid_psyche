The spacecraft, roughly the size of a small van, is due to reach the asteroid in August 2029.\nThe launch, shown live on Nasa TV, marks the latest in a series of recent Nasa missions seeking insights about the origins of our planet about 4.5 billion years ago by sending robotic spacecraft to explore asteroids \u2013 primordial relics from the dawn of the solar system.\nAsteroid Psyche measures roughly 279km across at its widest point and resides on the outer fringes of the main asteroid belt between the planets Mars and Jupiter.\nCargo-faring panels enclosing the spacecraft inside the nose of the rocket\u2019s upper stage were jettisoned about five minutes after the launch, and the probe itself was released into space about an hour later. Nasa said the process for the spacecraft to autonomously unfurl its twin solar panels and to point its communications antennae towards Earth takes around two hours.\nMission controllers at Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles confirmed detection of the probe\u2019s first radio signals shortly after it was seen on live video floating free from the rocket.\nThe JPL team plans to spend the next three to four months conducting checks of the spacecraft\u2019s systems before sending it on its deep space journey, propelled by solar-electric ion thrusters being used for the first time on an interplanetary mission.\nAfter reaching the asteroid, the spacecraft would then orbit it for 26 months, scanning Psyche with instruments built to measure its gravity, magnetic properties and composition.\nAccording to the leading hypothesis, Psyche is the once-molten, long-frozen inner hulk of a baby planet torn apart by collisions with other celestial bodies in the early solar system. It orbits the Sun about three times farther than Earth, even at its closest to our planet.\n\u2018Outer space to explore inner space\u2019\nThe first asteroid of its kind chosen for study at close range by spacecraft, Psyche is believed to consist largely of iron, nickel, gold and other metals, with a collective hypothetical monetary value placed at 10 quadrillion dollars.\nBut the mission has nothing to do with space mining, according to scientists. Its objective is to gain greater understanding of the formation of Earth and other rocky planets that are built around cores of molten metal. Earth\u2019s molten centre is too deep and too hot to ever be examined directly.\n\u201cSo we say, tongue-in-cheek, that we\u2019re going to outer space to explore inner space,\u201d Professor Lindy Elkins-Tanton, Psyche\u2019s principal investigator for Nasa\u2019s mission partner Arizona State University, told a briefing for reporters on Tuesday."}
