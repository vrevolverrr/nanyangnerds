But the two authoritarian governments, both chafing under Western sanctions, share a view of the United States as their great enemy and a threat to their grip on power.\n\u201cThis is a partnership of convenience between two embattled dictatorships,\u201d said Mr Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nBoth countries are deep in crisis, struggling economically and politically. Iran is attempting to quell street protests that pose the most serious challenge in years to the government, while Russia is trying to manage rising dissension over a faltering war effort and an unpopular draft.\nThe emergence of a Moscow-Teheran alliance has multiple international implications, potentially dimming prospects for a new agreement to rein in Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and raising the pressure on Israel, Iran\u2019s sworn enemy, to take Ukraine\u2019s side in the war.\nThe relationship between Russia and Iran has been developing for years.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin deployed his air force to Syria starting in 2015 to prevent the collapse of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, a longtime ally of Teheran. Russia and Iran worked in lock step militarily, with Russian warplanes providing cover for Iranian militiamen and Iranian proxy forces fighting on the ground.\nSyria was one example of the effort by both to find ways to sap American strength and prestige wherever they could in the world, and Ukraine provides a similar opportunity on an even larger, more visible scale.\nAfter its 1979 revolution, Iran formulated foreign policy around the slogan \u201cNeither East Nor West\u201d, equally wary of the Soviet Union and the US. Now, the Islamic Republic is choosing sides, analysts said, and images of Iran\u2019s exploding drones accurately hitting their targets advertise it as a regional power to be taken seriously.\nIn Teheran, the spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry denied on Monday that his country was selling weapons to Russia, even as social media outlets linked to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, which developed the lumbering yet lethal drones, boasted about them.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the drones used by Russia\u2019s military are Iranian,\u201d said a post on Sepah Cyberi, a Telegram channel affiliated with the Guard, while the country\u2019s cyberarmy chief Ali Akbar Raefipour gloated on Twitter that Iran\u2019s Shahed drone was now \u201cthe most talked about weapon in the world\u201d.\nIran does not want to highlight the weapons sales because Ukraine is generally more popular than Russia among ordinary Iranians, and the Islamic Republic casts itself as a defender of underdogs in world affairs, said Dr Mahmoud Shoori, deputy director of the Institute of Iran and Eurasia Studies in Teheran and an expert on Iran-Russia relations.\nBut at the same time, \u201cIran also wants to show the world that it has a military superpower as an ally and it has the capacity to sell weapons to such a power\u201d, he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt shows the West\u2019s policies of maximum pressure to isolate Iran have not worked.\u201d\nIran or its proxies have been accused of using drones for attacks on adversaries in its own region, such as Saudi Arabia.\nFor Iran, Russian use of its drones sends a message to its domestic audience, including those who have been protesting against restrictions on women\u2019s rights and personal freedom for weeks.\nThe government is trying to show Iranians that it is \u201cnot in a position of weakness, and has not been cowed by external pressure and threats,\u201d said Dr Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, an independent research institute.\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that Iran would also sell short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, weapons far more deadly than the drones. Analysts used to laugh off Iranian missiles as cheap knockoffs of Soviet or North Korean weapons, but no longer.\nIn recent years, Iran has made \u201clots of advances and has really improved their targeting ability\u201d, said Dr Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor of Middle Eastern politics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.\nIt is not clear how Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s primary regional adversary, will react to the Kremlin\u2019s drawing closer to Teheran. The Saudi government and Moscow have joined forces recently in trying to raise oil prices, irking Washington and fuelling inflation.\nIn Israel on Sunday, Cabinet Minister Nachman Shai said on social media that Iran\u2019s military assistance to Russia removed \u201cany doubt where Israel should stand in this bloody conflict. The time has come for Ukraine to receive military aid, as well, just as the USA and Nato countries provide\u201d. NYTIMES"}
