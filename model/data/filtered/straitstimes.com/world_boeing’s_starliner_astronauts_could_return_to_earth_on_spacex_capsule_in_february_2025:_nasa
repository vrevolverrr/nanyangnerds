Recent results have unearthed new information, causing greater alarm about a safe return.\nThe latest test data has stirred disagreements and debate within Nasa about whether to accept the risk of a Starliner return to Earth, or make the call to use Crew Dragon instead.\nUsing a SpaceX craft to return astronauts that Boeing had planned to bring back on Starliner would be a major blow to an aerospace giant that has struggled for years to compete with SpaceX and its more experienced Crew Dragon team.\nStarliner has been docked to the ISS for 63 of the maximum 90 days it can stay, and it is parked at the same port that Crew Dragon will have to use to deliver the upcoming astronaut crew.\nOn Aug 6, Nasa, using a SpaceX rocket and a Northrop Grumman capsule, delivered a routine shipment of food and supplies to the station, including extra clothes for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams.\nStarliner\u2019s high-stakes mission is a final test required before Nasa can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut flights to and from the ISS. Crew Dragon received Nasa approval for astronaut flights in 2020.\nStarliner development has been set back by management issues and numerous engineering problems. It has cost Boeing US$1.6 billion (S$2.12 billion) since 2016, including US$125 million from Starliner\u2019s current test mission, securities filings show.\nConcerns at Nasa\nA meeting this week of Nasa\u2019s commercial crew programme, which oversees Starliner, ended with some officials disagreeing with a plan to accept Boeing\u2019s testing data and use Starliner to bring the astronauts home, officials said during a news conference.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t poll in a way that led to a conclusion,\u201d commercial crew programme chief Steve Stich said.\nMr Ken Bowersox, Nasa\u2019s space operations chief, added: \u201cWe heard from a lot of folks that had concerns, and the decision was not clear.\u201d\nA Boeing executive was not at the Aug 7 press conference.\nWhile no decision has been made on using Starliner or Crew Dragon, Nasa has been buying Boeing more time to do more testing and gather more data to build a better case to trust Starliner. Nasa expects to make a decision some time next week, officials said.\nThe agency on Aug 6 delayed by more than a month SpaceX\u2019s upcoming Crew Dragon mission, a routine flight called Crew-9, that is expected to send three Nasa astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS.\nNasa's ISS programme chief said the agency has not yet decided which astronauts they would pull off the mission for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams if necessary.\nBoeing\u2019s testing so far has shown that four of Starliner\u2019s jets had failed in June because they overheated and automatically turned off, while other thrusters re-fired during tests appeared weaker than normal because of some restriction to their propellant.\nGround tests in late July at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico have helped reveal that the thrusters\u2019 overheating causes a Teflon seal to warp, choking propellant tubes for the thrusters and thereby weakening their thrust.\n\u201cThat, I would say, upped the level of discomfort, and not having a total understanding of the physics of what\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr Stich said, describing why Nasa now appears more willing to discuss a Crew Dragon contingency after previously downplaying such a prospect to reporters.
