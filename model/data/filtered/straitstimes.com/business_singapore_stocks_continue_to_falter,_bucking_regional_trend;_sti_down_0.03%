{"title": "Singapore stocks continue to falter, bucking regional trend; STI down 0.03%", "tags": "business", "timestamp": "2024-09-26", "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Local shares bucked the trend across the region and dipped into the red on Sept 26 \u2013 their third straight day of decline.\nThe shaky mood left the Straits Times Index (STI) down 0.03 per cent or 1.04 points to 3,582.23, but gainers easily outnumbered decliners 428 to 226 on trade of 1.4 billion shares worth $1.8 billion in the broader market.\nDFI Retail Group reversed its fortunes to become the STI\u2019s biggest gainer after being at the bottom of the table on Sept 25. It closed up 2.6 per cent at US$1.99, while Singtel was the biggest loser, 2.1 per cent lower at $3.22.\nThe local banks continued to slip, with DBS Bank down 0.2 per cent to $38.30, OCBC Bank off 0.3 per cent at $15.23 and UOB retreating 0.5 per cent to $32.36.\nMajor regional indexes rose despite Wall Street turning weaker after record-setting performances earlier in the week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average taking the biggest hit, falling 0.7 per cent. The Kospi in Seoul rose 2.9 per cent, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng jumped 4.2 per cent and Australian shares added 1 per cent, their biggest one-day rise in two weeks, to close just shy of a record high.\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut should support Singapore market earnings for this half of 2024, said Mr Thilan Wickramasinghe, head of research at Maybank Securities Singapore.\nThere could be a floor to the downgrades on tech manufacturing and real estate investment trusts (Reits), while rising trends could drive upgrades for gaming, industrials, Internet and telcos.\n\u201cWe believe the recent bigger-than-expected Fed cuts, as it begins an easing cycle, should help ease funding costs for Reits and tech manufacturing, while also supporting the top line,\u201d said Mr Wickramasinghe."}
