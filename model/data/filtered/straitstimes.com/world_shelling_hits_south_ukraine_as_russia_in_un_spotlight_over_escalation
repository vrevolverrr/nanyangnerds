No casualties were reported.\nRussia denies targeting civilians. Its RIA state news agency reported that Ukrainian forces bombed a hotel in the city of Kherson, killing two people. Russian forces have occupied the southern city since the early days of the invasion.\nThere has been no immediate response from Ukraine.\nReuters could not verify either side's claims.\nThe votes on becoming part of Russia were hastily organised after Ukraine recaptured large swathes of the north-east in a counteroffensive in September.\nUkrainian officials said people were banned from leaving some occupied areas until the four-day vote was over, armed groups were going into homes, and employees were threatened with the sack if they did not participate.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the votes would be \"unequivocally condemned\" by the world, along with the mobilisation Russia began this week, including in Crimea and other areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia.\nRussia maintains that the referendums offer an opportunity for people in those regions to express their view.\nMr Lavrov, in a news conference following his speech to the assembly in New York, said the regions where votes are under way would be under Moscow's \"full protection\" if they are annexed by Russia.\nAsked if Russia would have grounds for using nuclear weapons to defend annexed regions of Ukraine, Mr Lavrov said Russian territory, including territory \"further enshrined\" in Russia's Constitution in the future, \"is under the full protection of the state\".\n\"All of the laws, doctrines, concepts and strategies of the Russian Federation apply to all of its territory,\" he said, also referring specifically to Russia's doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons.\nThe Group of Seven industrialised economies have said they will not recognise the results of the votes.\nUkraine's foreign minister, Mr Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia's statements on the possible use of nuclear weapons were \"absolutely unacceptable\" and Kyiv would not give into them.\n\"We call on all nuclear powers to speak out now and make it clear to Russia that such rhetoric put the world at risk and will not be tolerated,\" said Mr Kuleba.\nUkraine has requested an urgent UN Security Council meeting over the referendums, accusing Russia of violating the UN Charter by attempting to change Ukraine's borders, Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said on Twitter.\nMr Putin on Wednesday ordered the first mobilisation since World War II, sending some Russian men swiftly towards borders, with traffic at frontier crossings with Finland and Georgia surging and prices for air tickets from Moscow rocketing.\nMore than 2,000 people have been detained across Russia for protesting the draft, including 798 people in 33 towns on Saturday, according to independent monitoring group OVD-Info.\nFrustration has even spread to pro-Kremlin media, with one editor at the state-run RT news channel complaining that problems like call-up papers being sent to the wrong men were \"infuriating people\".\nWhen asked on Saturday why so many Russians were leaving the country, Mr Lavrov pointed to the right of freedom of movement.\nBritish military intelligence reported that a Russian nationalist politician had called for the National Guard to be reinforced under the mobilisation, in what appeared to be a new indication of the pressure Russian forces are facing.\n\"With a requirement to quell growing domestic dissent in Russia, as well as operational taskings in Ukraine, Rosgvardia is highly likely under particular strain,\" British Defence Intelligence said in a briefing note, referring to the force that answers directly to Mr Putin and was created in 2016 to fight terrorism and organised crime.
