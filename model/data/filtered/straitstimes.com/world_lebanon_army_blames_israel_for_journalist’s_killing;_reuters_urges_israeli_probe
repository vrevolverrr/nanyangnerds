It said its actions followed Hezbollah fire along the Israel-Lebanon border, and that the incident was under review.\nThe Lebanese military source said the army had concluded the shell that killed Mr Abdallah was fired by Israel, based on observation by Lebanese army patrols in the area at the time of the incident. The source was not authorised to speak to the media and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\u201cThe Israeli enemy launched a missile which hit a civilian car belonging to a media group which led to the martyrdom of the videographer Issam Abdallah,\u201d the Lebanese army high command said in a statement posted on its website.\nReuters, in a statement signed by president Paul Bascobert and editor-in-chief Alessandra Galloni, said: \"We call on the Israel Defense Forces to conduct a thorough, swift and transparent investigation. It is critically important for journalists to be able to report freely and safely.\"\nReuters video journalist Abdallah was killed while working with other journalists near the village of Alma al-Shaab, close to the Israeli border, where the Israeli military and Lebanese militia Hezbollah have been trading fire.\nResponding to a request for comment on Reuters\u2019 call for an investigation, Israel\u2019s military said Hezbollah had fired at a number of border locations, \u201cincluding the firing of an anti-tank missile that hit the Israel security fence\u201d.\nThe military said it suspected an infiltration into Israeli territory immediately after the anti-tank missile launch, and that troops used tank and artillery fire to prevent the infiltration.\n\u201cA number of hours later, a report was received that during the incident, journalists were injured in the area. The incident is under review,\u201d the military added.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims made by Lebanon.\nIsraeli army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Hecht earlier told a regular briefing that it was looking into the incident, adding: \u201cWe already have visuals. We\u2019re doing cross-examination. It\u2019s a tragic thing.\u201d\nA Reuters witness at the scene said Mr Abdallah, a Lebanese national, was struck by missiles fired from the direction of Israel.\nMr Nazeh and Mr Al-Sudani were both injured in the incident but were later released from hospital. Agence France-Presse and Al Jazeera each said two of their journalists were wounded in the incident.\nMr Nazeh said they were filming missile fire coming from the direction of Israel when one struck Mr Abdallah as he was sitting on a low stone wall near the rest of the group. Seconds later, another missile hit a car being used by the group, setting it aflame, he said.\nThe UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said it could not say with certainty at this stage how the group of journalists was hit. However, it said it knew that Israel had struck a position 2.5km outside Alma al-Shaab at 5.20pm.\nThe Reuters statement said it had requested Israeli assurances that Reuters journalists and offices in the Gaza Strip would not be targeted in Israeli military operations there.\nIsraeli forces are massing tanks and troops on the border with the southern enclave in preparation for a possible ground invasion. They are fighting a war with Gaza\u2019s Hamas militants who launched a deadly assault on Israeli civilians and soldiers a week ago. REUTERS"}
