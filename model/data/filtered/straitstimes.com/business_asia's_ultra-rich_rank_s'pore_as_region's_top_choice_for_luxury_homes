The manner in which Singapore's government was able to financially support businesses as well as put in place measures to control the spread of Covid-19 further enhanced Singapore's reputation as a safe bastion for investors,\" he said.\nThis could augur well for luxury home prices this year, with 26 per cent of those surveyed planning to buy a new home in 2021, up from 21 per cent in 2020. \"This demand could help fuel price rises of up to 7 per cent in key markets\" this year, the report said.\nMoreover, unlike Auckland, Shenzhen, Seoul and Manila, where average home prices ended between 10 per cent and 18 per cent higher last year, prices of prime homes in Singapore dipped 0.2 per cent and sales plunged 20 per cent due to a lack of new launches and as travel restrictions kept foreign investors away.\nNevertheless, Singapore continues to be an oasis for investments due to its stable political environment as well as the extensive measures to mitigate any recurrence of the outbreak, the report said.\nThis is borne out by a 10.2 per cent increase in the number of ultra-high net worth individuals in Singapore last year to 3,732, despite the recession and an overall drop in median household income from work of 2.4 per cent, Ms Wendy Tang, group managing director of Knight Frank Singapore, said.\n\"Given that South-east Asia has one of the fastest-growing middle-class demographics in the world, Singapore is well positioned to ride the growth. As such, the number of ultra-high net worth individuals in Singapore is forecast to grow by about 31 per cent between 2020 and 2025 to 4,888,\" she said.\nMr Leonard Tay, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore, added: \"Singapore also has a smaller ultra-high net worth individuals population compared against other Asian countries in the list. With a lower base, a relatively decent growth in quantum results in a higher percentage increase.\""}
