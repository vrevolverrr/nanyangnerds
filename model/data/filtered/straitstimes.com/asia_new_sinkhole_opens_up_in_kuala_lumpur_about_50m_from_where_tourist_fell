We must conduct an integrity audit because there have been new developments (around the area). We need to find out the source (of the sinkholes). The public should be safe as long as they follow City Hall\u2019s instructions,\u201d said Datuk Seri Fadillah.\nThe agencies involved will be the Public Works Department, DBKL, the Fire and Rescue Department and IWK. Technical experts, geoscientists and geologists, among others, will be roped in to assist in the investigation.\nSpeaking to The Straits Times, Professor Jeffrey Chiang Choong Luin, president of the Institution of Engineers, Malaysia, said the close proximity of the first and second sinkholes hints at a link between the two.\n\u201cThere could be a service pipe that has been compromised running underground. If it has been compromised, this would affect the soil\u2019s integrity, and the water seepage would erode the soil,\u201d he said.\nHe added that DBKL should do extensive mapping of the soil condition in the area and identify other potential hot spots. He also lauded the authorities for cordoning off the entire area for public safety.\nHe cautioned people to be aware of telltale signs of potential sinkholes, such as uneven ground, cracks in buildings, water pooling in one location and tilted fences.\nGiven that the two sinkholes might be linked, Prof Chiang did not dismiss the possibility that more sinkholes could appear between the first and second one, or that the entire stretch could collapse, creating one giant sinkhole.\nA staff member of the Palace Hotel in Jalan Masjid India, who wanted to be known only as Jamal, told ST he was not worried about falling into any sinkholes on the road.\nHowever, the same could not be said of guests, with the hotel seeing 20 per cent of bookings cancelled since the incident.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time this has happened. There was a sinkhole a few months ago, there was another one last month, and then the sinkhole that took the tourist, and now this one. I am just cautious when I walk around, and I avoid pavements that are sunken,\u201d said Mr Jamal.\n\u201cAs for the hotel, I\u2019m confident of its foundation since the building has been around for four decades.\u201d\nOn Aug 23, Ms Vijayalaksmi, a 48-year-old Indian tourist from Kuppam, Andhra Pradesh, was walking along Jalan Masjid India when the ground suddenly caved in beneath her. She plummeted 8m into the hole and disappeared.\nEfforts to locate her have so far been futile.\nSearch and rescue operations were called off on Aug 27 owing to heavy rain. But on Aug 28, operations to locate Ms Vijayalaksmi were back in full swing, with the police, Fire and Rescue Department, DBKL and Civil Defence Force personnel at the scene."}
