Fire sprinklers are also installed as another layer of protection.\nSolar panels on the new building will be able to generate 210 megawatt-hour of renewable energy annually \u2013 equivalent to powering 48 four-room Housing Board flats.\nCertified Green Mark Platinum Zero Energy under the latest Green Mark 2021 scheme, the building also comes with features to teach students environmental sustainability. These include rainwater harvesting for plants at the rooftop garden, as well as kinetic floor tiles for students to generate energy when they step on the tiles.\nData on the amount of rainwater harvested, the energy consumed by the building and the energy produced by the solar panels are put out on a dashboard, which students can view and is also used to teach maths and physics.\nMs Karen Yung, founder and chief collaboration officer of Education in Motion, which runs Dulwich College (Singapore), said that future-proofing students in sustainability is key as many jobs in 2030 are forecast to require sustainability skill sets.\n\u201cWe must walk the talk by not just building\u2026 according to Singapore building codes.\u201d\nMs Yung added: \u201cWe have to challenge ourselves to create a building that represents our collective vision and commitment to create a sustainable and innovative learning environment.\u201d\nThe opening ceremony of The Greenhouse was also attended by Minister for National Development Desmond Lee and British High Commissioner Kara Owen.\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Lee said that he hopes more organisations will push the boundaries in energy efficiency, as Singapore looks to green buildings to achieve its net-zero goals.\nHe added: \u201cThis will not only allow companies to develop a competitive edge, but it also helps to align them with the growing environmental consciousness of investors and building users.\u201d"}
