He did not reveal how much the upgrading process will cost.\nAs tech companies race to develop quantum computers, it is crucial for companies to future-proof sensitive data now as upgrades, too, will take time to build, said ID Quantique chief executive Gregoire Ribordy.\nGoogle\u2019s quantum computer, created in 2019, can perform a computation in 200 seconds that would have taken the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years.\nIBM, one of the front runners in the quantum race, is set to release a more advanced processor in 2023 that will surpass these figures."}
