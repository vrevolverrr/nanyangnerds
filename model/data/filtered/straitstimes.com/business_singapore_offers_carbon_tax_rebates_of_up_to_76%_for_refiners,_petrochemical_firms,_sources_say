That would be close to a quarter of refiners\u2019 current margins in Singapore.\nUnder Singapore\u2019s new taxation rate for carbon emissions, which took effect on Jan 1, businesses that emit more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon annually pay $25 per tonne until 2025, compared with $5 per tonne from 2019 to 2023.\nThe rate will subsequently go up to $45 per tonne in 2026 and 2027, and between $50 and $80 per tonne by 2030, the Singapore Government announced in 2022.\nMajor companies in the refining and downstream sectors have been given rebates on a transitional basis to soften the added tax burden, lowering the final costs to between $6 and $10 per tonne of emissions, three of the sources said.\nThese refineries and downstream businesses will still have to pay an outright $25 per tonne of carbon emission tax and subsequently apply for the rebates, according to the terms and conditions set out by the Government, a fifth source said.\nSingapore has three refineries with a combined capacity of 1.119 million barrels per day, currently operated by Shell, ExxonMobil and Singapore Refining Company (SRC), a joint venture between Chevron and Singapore Petroleum Co, wholly owned by PetroChina.\nWhile the disruption of Russian oil trade amid the Ukraine war and post-pandemic demand boosted refining margins between 2020 and 2022, these profits have halved from peak levels reached in February.\nShell declined to comment, while an ExxonMobil spokesperson said: \u201cAs a matter of practice, we do not discuss confidential matters.\u201d\nAn SRC spokesperson said: \u201cThe Singapore Refining Company remains committed to support the Singapore Government\u2019s policies through close partnership and continued dialogue.\u201d\nThe concessions will likely be in place at least for 2024 and 2025, one of the sources said, adding that the \u201cdiscounted\u201d rate will be back on the table for discussion in 2026 or after.\nSingapore introduced a transition framework in 2023 to support companies in emissions-intensive trade-exposed sectors such as chemicals, electronics and biomedical manufacturing in their energy transition.\n\u201cThe allowances will only be provided for a proportion of the companies\u2019 emissions, and are based on internationally recognised efficiency benchmarks where available, or the ambition and robustness of companies\u2019 decarbonisation plans,\u201d a spokesperson for the Ministry of Trade and Industry told Reuters in an e-mail.\n\u201cTheir remaining emissions will continue to be subject to the prevailing headline carbon tax rates.\u201d\nThe duration of this transition framework will depend on the development of carbon prices internationally and the progress of decarbonisation technologies, he said, adding that companies will be given sufficient notice in advance of changes to facilitate business planning.\nA spokesperson for the National Environment Agency (NEA) said earlier that, in general, the carbon tax would have to be paid in the year following the reporting year \u201cbecause of the time needed to compile the emissions data and independently verify the total emissions of the reporting year\u201d.\nCompanies currently have the option to also offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions using international carbon credit \u2013 either bought or accumulated elsewhere in the world, according to the NEA.\nThis hefty increase in carbon taxes has been a hot topic in Singapore\u2019s refining sector, following the sale of Shell\u2019s flagship Bukom and Jurong Island refinery and petrochemical facilities amid stiff competition.
