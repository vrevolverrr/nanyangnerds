However, for too long, health has been a footnote to climate discussion,\u201d World Health Organisation head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the first-ever Health Day at COP28 in Dubai, calling for countries to include health in their climate action plans.\nRising temperatures are also pushing mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever and malaria into regions that were not previously affected by them, Dr Tedros said.\n\u2018Glaring omission\u2019\nClimate campaigners also criticised the failure of some high-emitting nations such as India, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa to endorse the COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health.\n\u201c(That) carries huge consequences for the populations of those countries in addition to the emissions that need to be addressed globally,\u201d said Ms Jess Beagley, policy lead for the GCHA, a coalition of health non-governmental organisations and health professionals.\nThe alliance called the declaration\u2019s failure to mention fossil fuels a \u201cglaring omission\u201d.\nIt did include the announcement of US$1 billion (S$1.34 billion) in pledges from governments, charities and development banks to mobilise finance for climate and health in developing countries, where climate-related health risks are especially high.\nThe funding initiative includes US$300 million from the Global Fund, US$100 million from the Rockefeller Foundation to support climate and health solutions, and a \u00a354 million (S$91.3 million) pledge from the British government.\nAt present, health-focused climate action receives only 2 per cent of adaptation funding and 0.5 per cent of climate funding.\nHealth and climate campaigners say that is nowhere near enough to tackle the growing burden of tropical diseases as the world warms, and other climate-driven health threats such as malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress."}
