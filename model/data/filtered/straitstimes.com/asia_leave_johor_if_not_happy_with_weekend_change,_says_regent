These states are controlled by opposition alliance Perikatan Nasional, led by the conservative Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) and Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia.\nOn Oct 7, Tunku Ismail announced that Johor will revert to a Saturday-Sunday weekend in 2025 from the existing Friday-Saturday schedule. He said this decision took into account Johoreans\u2019 desire for more family time and was in line with development projects that will benefit the state and its people.\nHowever, the decision was criticised by lawmakers from PAS and from Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), who said Friday should be prioritised as it is the holy day for Muslims.\nJohor changed its weekend to Friday and Saturday in 2014, in a move to honour the significance of Friday for Muslims and to recognise Islam as the state\u2019s religion.\nPKR MP Hassan Abdul Karim said that a Saturday-Sunday weekend aligns with the preferences of the British, Malaysia\u2019s former colonists, and changing the existing weekend disregards the state\u2019s culture, political history, and understanding.\n\u201cReverting to Sunday as a weekend and making Friday a working day was something the state had done a few years back. However, it did not last long because the Muslims in Johor did not support the move,\u201d he said in a statement on Facebook.\nEchoing similar views, Johor PAS leader Mohd Mazri Yahya described the Saturday-Sunday weekend as a \u201ccolonial legacy\u201d.\nCalling for parties to cease politicising the decision, Johor\u2019s Menteri Besar Onn Hafiz Ghazi said on Oct 11 that issues like this could exacerbate tensions and disrupt harmony within the state.\n\u201cThe state government believes that not all matters should be politicised. Every decision is made in the best interest of the state and the people of Johor in mind,\u201d he said in a statement on Facebook.\nAnalysts say the political parties\u2019 criticism is economically regressive, pointing out that the new weekend arrangement helps Johor align its economic activities with the federal government and enhances international business relations with neighbouring countries like Singapore and Indonesia.\nSaid Mr Halmie Azrie Abdul Halim, a senior analyst at political risk consultancy Vriens and Partners: \u201cWith the anticipated increase in investments flowing into the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, the new weekend changes will cater to the needs of incoming investors, as international businesses typically operate on Friday. PAS\u2019 \u2018colonial\u2019 statement will be seen as economically backward.\u201d\nThe current working week in Johor, which takes up four weekdays instead of the traditional five, could raise business costs for those investing in Johor with overseas operations, said Mr Amir Fareed Rahim, strategy director at political risk consultancy KRA Group.\n\u201cFor international businesses, Sunday is a holiday, and if they need to operate on a Sunday, the company would incur overtime charges for employees, which would increase the cost of doing business,\u201d he said."}
