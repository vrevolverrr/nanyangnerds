It also wants help shooting down incoming missiles.\nMr Kuleba made the comment during a conversation with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski that was broadcast live from Poland.\n\u201cThe war is always about a lot of hardware \u2013 money, weapons, resources \u2013 but the real problems are always here, in the heads,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMost of our partners are afraid of discussing the future of Russia... This is something that is very upsetting because if we do not speak about the future of the source of threat, then we cannot build strategy,\u201d he said.\nUkraine has relied heavily on the West to supply it with weapons and hardware and financial assistance to hold out against Russia and fight back against Moscow\u2019s troops.\nKyiv launched a major cross-border offensive into Russia\u2019s Kursk region on Aug 6 in what Russian President Vladimir Putin has called a \u201cmassive provocation\u201d.\nRussia\u2019s full-scale invasion has killed thousands of civilians, destroyed cities and forced millions of people from their homes.
