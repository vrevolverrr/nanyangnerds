Its economists said if a recession did occur it was likely to be a \"garden variety\" one in which unemployment rises several percentage points and output experiences a couple of weak quarters.\n\"We see this as a reasonable expectation, but the wildcard - as we have emphasised - is how stubborn inflationary dynamics ultimately prove to be,\" they said."}
