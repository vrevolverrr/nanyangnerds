More than 20 TACs representing 14 industry sectors have pledged their support.\nUnder the initiative, IHRP will develop resources to help enterprises adopt job redesign, including step-by-step sectoral playbooks and capability development workshops.\nAn expert panel that includes academics, HR and legal professionals as well as leaders from the Government, unions and business community will also share success stories of job redesign and provide guidance on available capability development initiatives firms can tap, among other things.\nMs Dilys Boey, WSG\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cHuman capital is the cornerstone of a successful enterprise transformation... Through job redesign, enterprises can make jobs more productive and also build up employees\u2019 employment resilience to help them stay current, while enhancing their overall career health.\u201d\nIn his speech, Dr Tan cited local telco Singtel as an example of a company that has transformed jobs for more than 2,500 employees and tapped WSG\u2019s Productivity Solutions Grant for Job Redesign.\n\u201cToday, if you were to contact Singtel\u2019s customer service, you might be interacting with a care adviser... Compared with the old role of a customer care officer, a Singtel care adviser now has an expanded portfolio and more advanced skill sets,\u201d he said.\nThe care advisers now have the relevant digital skills to manage multiple products and to perform more complex tasks while delivering better customer experience.\nSingtel has also reviewed its pay packages and introduced a structured career progression pathway, leading to more productive and engaged employees, said the minister.\nMs Angel Chua, 42, a cyber sales specialist at Singtel, said: \u201cUpskilling has helped me ensure that I stay relevant and be even more effective in a dynamic industry, so that I can better support my customers\u2019 needs and ensure that their business objectives are met.\u201d\nAlongside ensuring the relevance of workers, employers also need to attract and retain a wider talent pool as Singapore\u2019s resident workforce gets older, yet more educated, and as competition in the labour market intensifies.\nDr Tan said that an Alliance for Action on Widening Access to Talent has been formed to address this need. The group will bring together businesses and HR leaders to develop strategies employers can use.\nIt aims to come up with scalable initiatives that will help companies to use hiring practices focused on skills to leverage transferable skills and experience of workers in adjacent jobs.\nIt will also look to promote skills-based workforce development practices so that workers can move through jobs and gain experience within their firms.\nThese initiatives will be piloted in three sectors \u2013 manufacturing, information and communication technology (ICT) and retail.\nDr Tan said it may seem counterintuitive for companies to help their employees pursue new opportunities, but it is not.\n\u201cEven if you do not offer your employees opportunities, other companies will offer them, and your employees may eventually end up seeking opportunities with these other companies.\u201d\nThe alliance will run for six months from January 2024, and is supported by the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and National Trades Union Congress.\nIt will be co-led by Dr Bicky Bhangu, president of South-east Asia, Pacific and South Korea at Rolls-Royce and an SNEF council member, and Ms Aileen Tan, group chief people and sustainability officer at Singtel and an IHRP Master Professional. Other members will include leaders from businesses and TACs.\nDr Bicky said: \u201cTo meet the fast-evolving needs of the economy and workplace, there has to be a shift towards assessment and hiring of workers beyond relying solely on qualifications or past work experiences.\u201d\nMs Tan added that HR practitioners in the group will explore the use of jobs-skills data in helping organisations better assess their \u201cskills inventory\u201d and make data-driven decisions on reskilling, training and career development for employees.\nThe new resource and alliance were announced at IHRP\u2019s People Behind People Forum 2023, held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.\nThe forum, which is now in its fourth year, hosted more than 600 delegates representing over 80 organisations."}
