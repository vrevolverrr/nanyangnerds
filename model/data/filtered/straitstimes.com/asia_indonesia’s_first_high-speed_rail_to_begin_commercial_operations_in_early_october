Economic losses due to jams in greater Jakarta and Bandung have reached over 100 trillion rupiah (S$8.9 billion) annually,\u201d said President Joko Widodo after travelling on the high-speed rail (HSR) on Wednesday.\nBandung is 150km from Jakarta by road.\nThe commercial operations starting in October will involve eight trips during the month, with the frequency rising to 28, 40 and 68 trips, respectively, in November, December and January, according to the government.\nOriginally set to be operational by 2019, the HSR project faced problems with land acquisition and construction delays due to Covid-19.\n\u201cIt\u2019s comfortable. We ran at a speed of 350kmh. Didn\u2019t feel anything (vibration) at all. We expect this to open for the public in early October,\u201d Mr Widodo told reporters at Padalarang station, during the first leg of his round trip. His entourage departed at 9am local time (10am Singapore time).\nThe train reached Padalarang station, just outside Bandung, capital of Indonesia\u2019s most populous West Java province, in half an hour, compared with three hours by normal train.\nWest Java has a population of about 50 million \u2013 slightly smaller than South Korea\u2019s 52 million \u2013 which offers a good base of travellers for the train service.\nMr Widodo\u2019s trip on Wednesday was preceded by a series of comprehensive trials, with the speed of 180kmh first clocked in May and gradually raised to the maximum speed of 385kmh the following month.\nHe was accompanied by several Cabinet ministers including State-Owned Enterprise Minister Erick Thohir and Cabinet secretary Pramono Anung, along with a group of reporters, social media content creators and TV personalities.\nThe 30-minute train ride from Halim station in East Jakarta to Padalarang station was followed by a 20-minute feeder train trip to reach Bandung\u2019s city centre.\nThis is less than half the typical 2\u00bd-hour car journey between the two cities.\n\u201cTicket fares of the high-speed rail must be kept affordable, otherwise the facility would be used only for tourism, while commuters would shun it,\u201d said Mr Muhammad Abi Berkah Nadi, who teaches railway mechanical engineering at Institut Teknologi Sumatera in Lampung province in Sumatra.\nThe government has yet to announce the fares.\nA caller to Jakarta-based Elshinta radio, who identified himself as Mr Iswanto and said he is a frequent Jakarta-Bandung traveller, said on Wednesday: \u201cI normally use a private car or shuttle bus. I have no problem if the HSR fare is 350 rupiah a trip maximum.\u201d\nConstruction of the 142km-long project began in 2016. It forms part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and makes Indonesia the first South-east Asian nation to have a high-speed railway.\nIndonesian state companies, including rail operator KAI and construction company Wijaya Karya, control 60 per cent of project consortium KCIC, while China Railway Engineering Corporation and other Chinese companies hold the remaining stake.\nThe total projected cost of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR was initially estimated at US$6.07 billion (S$8.3 billion), but Jakarta said in 2022 that an additional US$1.2 billion was needed to meet the deadline for a commercial launch by June 2023.\nMr Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, a deputy to Indonesia\u2019s State-Owned Enterprises Minister, said earlier that the high-speed rail service will open up a number of new economic zones along the Jakarta-Bandung corridor, spurring development of residential areas and businesses such as shopping malls.\nJapan\u2019s Maglev bullet trains have clocked speeds of up to 603kmh, followed by France\u2019s TGV trains at 574.8kmh. The Shanghai Maglev comes third, hitting speeds of 460kmh, while Italy\u2019s Frecciargento trains can reach a maximum speed of 300kmh.\nA semi-high-speed train linking China\u2019s south-western province of Yunnan to Laos\u2019 capital city Vientiane, which started in December 2021, runs at 160kmh."}
