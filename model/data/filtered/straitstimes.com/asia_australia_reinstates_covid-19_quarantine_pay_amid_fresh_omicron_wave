People can apply from July 20.\nAs of the end of last year, the government had spent almost A$13 billion on 2.4 million employees in pandemic payments, according to official data, while total federal support since the pandemic began is estimated to be over A$300 billion.\nAuthorities urged people to wear masks indoors and get their booster shots soon as they brace for \"millions\" of new cases over the coming weeks with Australia confronting a tough winter amid the co-circulation of both Covid-19 and the flu virus.\nThe current wave is likely to peak in August, Mr Albanese said, adding health officials have likened the infection rate of the new variants to that of measles.\nHospital admissions in several states have already surpassed record levels, with over 4,600 people in hospitals in Australia.\nSince the pandemic began, Australia has reported about 8.7 million Covid-19 cases and 10,549 deaths, far lower than many countries."}
