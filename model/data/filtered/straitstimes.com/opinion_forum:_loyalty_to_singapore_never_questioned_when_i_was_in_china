My allegiance or loyalty to Singapore was never questioned. But, not surprisingly, the locals would describe us as tong zong (same ancestors) or yi jia ren (one family) if my forefathers were from the same region as theirs.\nFor those who have heard of Singapore, inevitably, recognition and praise would be given to our founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, for his leadership in transforming Singapore into a modern prosperous city-state.\nI would say that the more educated and urban Chinese are generally better-informed and less emotional or opinionated. It is not surprising that China\u2019s nation-building efforts have made many of its citizens more patriotic and proud of their culture and heritage. I believe they would be keen, given the opportunity, to share this with their foreign Chinese and non-Chinese friends."}
