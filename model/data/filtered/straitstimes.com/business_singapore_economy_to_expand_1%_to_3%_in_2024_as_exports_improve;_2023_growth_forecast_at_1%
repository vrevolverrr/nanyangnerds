{"title": "Singapore economy to expand 1% to 3% in 2024 as exports improve; 2023 growth forecast at 1%", "tags": "business", "timestamp": "2023-11-22", "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Singapore\u2019s economy is expected to grow between 1 per cent and 3 per cent in 2024 as trade-related sectors improve modestly, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Nov 22.\nGrowth in 2023 will come in at around 1 per cent amid weak export demand, MTI said in its latest quarterly economic survey report.\nThe forecast was narrowed from the range of 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent announced in August, and was much lower than the prediction of 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent made at the start of the year.\nMTI also said that gross domestic product grew 1.1 per cent year on year in the third quarter, a faster pace than the 0.5 per cent in the second quarter and the 0.4 per cent in the first three months of 2023. The growth rate was also better than MTI\u2019s advance estimate of 0.7 per cent.\nAnalysts said a better-than-expected outcome in the third quarter could be a sign of stabilisation after anaemic growth in the first half. It may also herald a potential recovery onwards into 2024.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew 1.4 per cent, accelerating from the 0.1 per cent expansion in the second quarter.\nGrowth in the July-August period was aided by the ongoing recovery in air travel and inbound tourism, which has buoyed sectors such as air transport and accommodation. Meanwhile, resilient labour market conditions continue to lend support to consumer-facing sectors like retail trade and food and beverage services.\nStill, the cumulative effects of higher interest rates and a slower-than-expected Chinese economy have kept overall growth depressed.\nDBS Bank economist Chua Han Teng said the surprise third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) uptick is in line with improving business sentiments.\n\u201cFor the important electronics cluster, Singapore firms anticipate better business conditions from the modest turnaround in global semiconductor sales, following the inventory digestion, even as they are cognisant of lingering geopolitical risks that could still disrupt supply chains,\u201d he said.\nLooking ahead to 2024, MTI said GDP growth rates in major economies such as the United States and euro zone are projected to slow further in the first half of next year due to continued tight financial conditions, before picking up gradually in the second half.\nThis, alongside a normalisation of inventory levels, is likely to support a turnaround in global manufacturing activity over the course of the year. In particular, global electronics demand is projected to recover, which will bolster the growth of most regional economies, MTI said.\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, the growth prospects of the manufacturing and trade-related sectors in Singapore, such as electronics, precision engineering and wholesale trade, are expected to improve in tandem with the turnaround in global electronics demand,\u201d said Mr Gabriel Lim, MTI\u2019s Permanent Secretary for Policy.\nMeanwhile, the finance and insurance sector is forecast to post a modest recovery as global interest rates moderate, he added.\nEnterprise Singapore on Nov 22 predicted a modest recovery for key exports in 2024 after lowering its forecast for 2023 amid a worse-than-expected performance.\nIt now expects key non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) to shrink by 12 per cent to 12.5 per cent in 2023, compared with August\u2019s forecast of a 9 per cent to 10 per cent contraction.\nFor 2024, Nodx is projected to rise by 2 per cent to 4 per cent in tandem with the expected turnaround in global electronics demand."}
