That largely overlaps with the tenure of Maduro, who blames U.S. sanctions for the country's problems.\nOn Friday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador criticized the U.S. stance as \"an excess\" and accused Blinken of \"overstepping his boundaries.\"\nCelso Amorim, the main foreign policy adviser for Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has cast some doubt on the opposition's vote tallies, describing them as \"informal data,\" and arguing that parts were \"based on quick count mechanisms, exit polls,\" in an interview with CNN Brazil.\nAmorim emphasized that Brazil did not seek to interfere in its neighbor's internal affairs, but wanted to promote \"social peace for Venezuela.\"\nTensions on the ground in Venezuela have been mounting all week.\nOn Friday morning, opposition leader Machado's party, Vente Venezuela, said its headquarters in Caracas was vandalized overnight after six hooded men with guns overpowered its security guards, entered offices and took equipment.\n\"We denounce the attacks and insecurity to which we are subjected for political reasons,\" the party said on social media.\nLater in the day, an allied opposition party, Voluntad Popular, said another one of its national leaders, Roland Carre\u00f1o, had been arbitrarily arrested. That followed the detention of the party's top leader earlier in the week.\nAnti-Maduro protesters clashed with police this week, and fresh opposition marches are expected on Saturday, which both Gonzalez and Machado are expected to attend.\nMaduro warned in a press conference on Friday that his government had discovered a \"terrorist plot\" set to take place in Bello Monte, near the opposition march meeting point.\nThe president, who characterizes the opposition as fascists and regularly denounces planned attacks and assassination attempts, played two audios and showed a screenshot of a text conversation that he said proved the plot.\nHe added that authorities have received 5,000 reports of criminal activities associated with protests via an app it published this week.\nSo far, at least 20 people have been killed in post-election protests, according to rights group Human Rights Watch. Some 1,200 others have been arrested in connection with the demonstrations, according to the government.\nRelatives of some of those arrested gathered outside police headquarters in Caracas on Thursday to call for their release.
