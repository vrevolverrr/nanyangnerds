The passengers on the plane were safe, security forces told Reuters.\nSixty people were reported to have been detained, according to the RIA news agency on Monday.\nRIA said the identity of 150 of what it called the most active protesters had been identified. It said nine police officers had received injuries in the incident, two of whom were being treated in hospital.\nThe unrest followed several other anti-Israel incidents in North Caucasus, sparked by Israel\u2019s war against Hamas militants in Gaza. The Dagestani government said early on Monday that it was strengthening security measures across the republic, which is home to about three million people.\nThe unrest in the region, where Russian security forces once fought an Islamist insurgency, could pose another challenge for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is waging a war in Ukraine and who has faced an attempted mutiny in 2023.\nVideos from Makhachkala airport obtained by Reuters showed the protesters, mostly young men, waving Palestinian flags, breaking down glass doors and running through the airport shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d or \u201cGod is Greatest\u201d. Another group was seen trying to topple over a patrol truck.\nThe Russian Aviation Authority closed the airport until it completes security checks. There were no immediate reports of arrests, but Russia\u2019s federal investigation agency ordered a criminal probe into the incident.\nMr Sergei Melikov, the head of Dagestan, said the incident was a gross violation of the law, even as Dagestanis \u201cempathise with the suffering of victims of the actions of unrighteous people and politicians, and pray for peace in Palestine\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no courage in waiting as a mob for unarmed people who have not done anything forbidden,\u201d Mr Melikov said on the Telegram messaging app.\nRegional leaders in two other areas of northern Caucasus called for calm. A similar appeal was issued by Dagestan\u2019s chief Muslim cleric, or mufti.\nIsrael urged Russian authorities to protect Israelis and Jews in their jurisdictions, following the recent spate of violence against Israeli and Jewish targets.\nIn the past few days, a Jewish centre under construction in Nalchik, the capital of the nearby Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, was set on fire, emergency officials said.\nThere were also reports on social media of small anti-Israeli gatherings over the weekend in Dagestan and across the North Caucasus in Russia\u2019s south. Reuters could not independently verify those reports.\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed the events on Russia\u2019s \u201cwidespread culture of hatred toward other nations, which is propagated by state television, pundits, and authorities\u201d.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin.\nRussia has tried to maintain contact with all sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict, but has angered Israeli authorities by inviting a Hamas delegation to Moscow. Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador on Sunday. REUTERS"}
