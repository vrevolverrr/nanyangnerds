Drugs worth around $19,000 were seized.\nThe drugs included 333g of cannabis, 13g of methamphetamine, also known as Ice, 5g of ketamine, 1g of heroin, 42 Erimin-5 tablets, two Ecstasy tablets and 65 vape devices suspected to contain tetrahydrocannabinol.\nTetrahydrocannabinol is the main psychoactive compound found in cannabis.\nA 32-year-old woman and 26-year-old man, both suspected drug traffickers, were among those arrested.\nThe woman was arrested at her home in Compassvale Drive in Sengkang, where officers recovered around 123g of cannabis and drug paraphernalia from her bedroom.\nThe man was arrested at his home in Bedok North Street 3, and around 107g of cannabis and drug paraphernalia were seized.\n\u201cThose who think they can carry out their drug activities with impunity by using chat applications such as Telegram will do well to think again,\u201d said CNB\u2019s director of intelligence, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aaron Tang.\nHe added that CNB will not be deterred from carrying out enforcement against such offenders just because of the anonymity that such applications offer.\n\u201cIn fact, we will redouble our efforts to track them down and bring them in, whatever application they are using.\u201d\nStatistics released by the CNB in February showed that more than half of new drug abusers arrested in 2023 were below age 30. Among them were five 14-year-olds, who were the youngest abusers to be arrested.\nThere was also a rise in the number of female drug abusers, with 454 arrested in 2023, compared with 408 in 2022.\nIn March, drugs worth $555,000 were seized in an islandwide raid in which 64 suspected drug offenders were arrested, including four Singaporean teenagers aged between 17 and 19.\nIt is an offence to traffic or offer to traffic in a controlled drug, regardless of whether the person is doing it for himself or on behalf of another person, and whether or not the latter is in Singapore.\nInvestigations into the drug activities of all the arrested suspects are ongoing, said CNB."}
