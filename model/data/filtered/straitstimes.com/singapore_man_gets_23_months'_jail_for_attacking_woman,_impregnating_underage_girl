They had unprotected sex.\nIn March 2017, he invited the victim, then 15, to his home, where they had unprotected sex again. This was the fifth time they had intimate relations.\nShe found out that she was eight weeks' pregnant in May 2017 and staff of KK Women's and Children's Hospital informed the police.\nAfter she gave birth, a paternity test revealed that Muhammad Hafiz was the biological father.\nSeparately, in January 2017, he kicked his then girlfriend's leg and punched her in the face several times after they got into an argument."}
