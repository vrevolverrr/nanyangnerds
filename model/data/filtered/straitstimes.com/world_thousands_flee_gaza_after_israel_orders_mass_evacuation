But it was too soon to tell.\n\u201cAs I am packing my things I am wondering, is this really another nakba? I am taking my house key and thinking, will I ever return to my home, will I ever see my home again?\u201d said Dr Arwa El-Rayes, 56, a doctor of internal medicine, speaking in the last moments before she fled her childhood home in Gaza City in the north, the main city in the territory.\nThe nakba, which means catastrophe, is how Palestinians refer to the displacement of 1948.\nThe Israeli military says that it is urging the more than one million residents of northern Gaza to move to the southern half of the enclave for their own safety, even as residents said airstrikes on the south continued. But there has been no suggestion that they should leave the territory or that they will not be allowed to return to their homes after the fighting.\nThe majority of Gaza\u2019s population, some 1.7 million of the 2.1 million residents, are among those who were forced to leave their homes in 1948, or their descendants. In 1948, many Palestinians were told they would be allowed to return to their homes after a few days or weeks. Many took with them just a few belongings and the keys to their front doors. But they were never allowed to return.\nThe Gaza Strip has been under intense airstrikes for days, in an onslaught unleashed after Hamas, the group that controls Gaza, launched a surprise attack on southern Israel over the weekend that killed more than 1,300 people \u2013 including civilians and soldiers.\nIsraeli airstrikes have killed more than 1,500 people in Gaza since then, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry.\nGazans said they are worried that they are being forced to go to a sparse and somewhat rural area with no services. The Gaza Strip has already been cut off from water, food and electricity after Israel imposed what it called a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d days ago.\nSome residents said they decided to stay in their homes, despite the grave danger of an Israeli ground invasion, worried about being permanently displaced.\nGaza resident Mahmoud Shurrab said he saw the warnings to evacuate the northern part of the Gaza Strip on Facebook on Friday morning and quickly packed a backpack with important documents. He then began driving with his mother south seeking safety.\nOn the way, he said, he saw droves of people lining to fill their gas tanks, and others loading luggage into their cars."}
