She quickly got dressed and left her home with her son and pets to gather downstairs with her neighbours.\nMadam Teng said: \u201cThere was a lot of smoke. Thankfully, nobody was injured and everyone was evacuated in time. It was very nice when I saw the neighbours accounting for each other to ensure nobody was left behind.\n\u201cCases like this have happened before, and I think this could have been prevented. Hopefully, this will serve as a lesson for everyone around the area,\u201d she added.\nWhen The Straits Times visited the scene at 4pm, five workers were repairing the wiring for the units on the 10th floor to ensure they were safe to use.\nThe affected unit was covered in soot and dust, and littered with glass shards and damaged belongings.\nThe flat owner was not there, but neighbours said she lives with her toddler son and her mother."}
