Five years later, Meta acquired the tool, making it free and expanding its access for others across media. Soon, reporters and researchers were using the tool to investigate topics as diverse as Russian influence operations, misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic and the QAnon conspiracy movement.\nJournalists\u2019 use of the tool also shed light on Facebook and Instagram users\u2019 high engagement levels with inflammatory conspiracies.\nIn 2021, Meta executives clashed over the issue of data transparency and how much the social network should reveal about popular content on its platform. That July, the New York Times reported that the CrowdTangle team within Meta was being broken up.\nMeta also rescinded other initiatives, including a US$40,000 (S$52,700) grant that aimed to help research partners use CrowdTangle data to understand public discussion around the Covid-19 pandemic.\nUntil CrowdTangle\u2019s closure, Meta maintained a list of dozens of case studies showing how researchers used the tool to, for instance, identify Russia-linked influence operations in Africa or track Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.\nIn 2022, Bloomberg reported that Meta had started an official internal process to shutter CrowdTangle. Though the company\u2019s executives have recently framed the shutdown of the tool as necessary because it is \u201cdegrading\u201d, the company had already been devoting dwindling resources to the product, Bloomberg reported. In mid-2022, fewer than five engineers on Facebook\u2019s London integrity team were tasked with keeping CrowdTangle afloat.\nIn their letter to Meta, lawmakers noted that the Meta Content Library provides a view of the platform only at the time a search is conducted, which would make it difficult for researchers to reproduce a search or a study conducted by another. The lawmakers also noted that the constraint \u201climits and complicates the ability of researchers to study what occurred on the platform\u201d.\nThat could make it harder for researchers to investigate, for instance, the origin and spread of election-related misinformation on Facebook and Instagram over time.\nDr Fabio Giglietto, an associate professor of internet studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo in Italy, said that he anticipated many researchers would voice their disappointment over the end of CrowdTangle.\n\u201cThe alternative is not yet fully ready,\u201d Dr Giglietto said, citing difficulties with running queries on the tool using the virtual environment it requires. \u201cThis is particularly frustrating for those who successfully navigated the overly complex application process and cumbersome set-up,\u201d he said.\nMeta\u2019s move to sunset CrowdTangle also comes amid relaxed content moderation policies and information integrity efforts across social media platforms."}
