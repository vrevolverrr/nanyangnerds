There was no threat to the mainland, it said.\nThe quake followed at least three other tremors in the region with magnitudes ranging from 5.7 to 6.1 in a span of just over an hour.\nThere were no immediate reports of damage near the epicentre in New Caledonia, John Ristau, a seismologist from New Zealand-based GNS Science, told NewsHub's The AM Show. \"It's most likely that damage would have been minimal if anything at all,\" he said, adding that Thursday morning's earthquake could trigger more tremors.\nThe US Tsunami Warning System said a tsunami watch was in effect for American Samoa and cited a potential for tsunamis in other regions including Vanuatu, Fiji and New Zealand. Waves reaching up to a level of 1 metre above the normal tide level were possible for some coastal areas, it added.\nThe Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", where tectonic plates collide, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity.\nIn 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.\nA 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region.\nThe death toll included around 170,000 in Indonesia -- one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history."}
