Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output dropped 8.7 per cent.\nDBS Bank economist Chua Han Teng said the March data meant that in the first quarter of 2024, manufacturing output contracted by 1.8 per cent year on year, compared with 1.8 per cent year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nHe said: \u201cThe choppy and uneven factory performance in the first three months of 2024 suggests that the recovery will be gradual, with our expectations still for better manufacturing prospects in 2024 versus 2023\u2019s full-year contraction.\u201d\nThe electronics cluster performance will be key to Singapore\u2019s manufacturing recovery, Mr Chua noted, adding that improvement in the global electronics cycle and demand remains intact and this should benefit local electronics manufacturers.\nElectronics accounts for nearly 48 per cent of total manufacturing output, with semiconductors alone making up about 20 per cent.\nMaybank economist Chua Hak Bin said the weaker-than-expected performance in March is consistent with non-oil domestic exports, which contracted in the first quarter.\nHe said Singapore\u2019s semiconductor production structure may not be as leveraged to the ongoing boom in advanced chips for artificial intelligence servers, compared with peers like Taiwan and South Korea.\nThis is because Singapore\u2019s semiconductor ecosystem is primarily built around mature nodes (less advanced chips) used for power management, among others, said Maybank\u2019s Dr Chua, who added that the Republic may be more exposed to the slowdown in demand for automotive and industrial chips.\nStill, he expects Singapore\u2019s manufacturing and exports to pick up in the coming quarters as the upturn in the electronics cycle broadens beyond artificial intelligence servers.\nDr Chua continues to expect the economy to grow by 2.4 per cent in 2024. \u201cWe expect first-quarter final GDP (gross domestic product) growth, to be released in May, to come in around 2.2 per cent, lower than the earlier 2.7 per cent flash estimate, because of the sharp manufacturing contraction in March.\u201d\nThe EDB data showed the biomedical industry\u2019s output shrank the most in March with a 34.3 per cent plunge, led by the halving of the pharmaceuticals segment.\nPharmaceutical output sank 54.1 per cent, due to a different mix of active ingredients being produced compared with a year ago.\nThe chemicals industry\u2019s output grew 4.2 per cent while the precision engineering segment expanded 3.2 per cent from a year ago, but these expansions were not enough to offset the declines in the other four clusters.\nElectronics output fell 11.3 per cent despite an 18.8 per cent growth in infocomms and consumer electronics. The decline was largely due to the semiconductor industry, where production shrank 14.4 per cent.\nTransport engineering output fell 9.7 per cent from the same month a year ago, with 2023 being a strong base year for comparison."}
