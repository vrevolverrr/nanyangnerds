The system includes four biological stages ranked a, b, c and d. For example, Stage 1a is when a person is completely asymptomatic but has abnormal biomarkers.\nDr Jack said: \u201cStage 1a is really the beginning of evidence that someone has the disease.\u201d\nIn Stage 2, an individual may have abnormal biomarkers and very subtle changes in cognition or behaviour. Stage 3 is roughly equivalent to the current presymptomatic stage known as mild cognitive impairment, while stages 4, 5, and 6 are equivalent to mild, moderate and severe dementia.\nThe new scale also includes a Stage 0 for people who carry genes that guarantee they will develop Alzheimer\u2019s. This category includes people with Down syndrome, 75 per cent of whom develop Alzheimer\u2019s as adults.\nNoting the new system\u2019s similarity to cancer stages, Dr Jack said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as mild breast cancer. They\u2019re numeric stages.\u201d\nHe noted that many other conditions can cause dementia, but not all dementia is Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe proposed guidelines are intended for doctors to use in clinical practice as many face the prospect for the first time of offering patients treatments that can slow the course of the disease, rather than just treat symptoms.\nThe draft guidelines are open for expert review and comment and will be revised later to reflect that input, according to a spokesman for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nAlzheimer\u2019s, which gradually destroys memory and thinking skills, is characterised by changes in the brain including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles that result in the loss of neurons and their connections.\nThe 2018 guidelines, which were intended for research use, incorporated existing technologies for detecting Alzheimer\u2019s proteins based on positron emission tomography scans of the brain and tests of cerebrospinal fluid, which were accessible only via a lumbar puncture. Such tests were costly and not typically used in standard medical practice. REUTERS"}
