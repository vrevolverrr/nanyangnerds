Intelligent and capable, they\u2019ve succeeded through innate talent, hard and sustained work, ambition and vision. Both are the kind of mega pop stars who inspire convulsions of adulation and tears. Crowds surge and part in their presence. They are graced with a radiance that seems almost exclusive to celebrities, with skin so incandescent it needs no filter.\nBut they are not perfect. Nor, importantly, do they pretend to be. A recent Apple TV+ documentary, Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me, offers an unsparing portrait of Gomez, now 30, and her experiences with bipolar disorder, lupus, anxiety and psychosis. On her latest album, Midnights, Swift, 32, sings about her depression working the graveyard shift, about ending up in crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s me, hi, I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me / It\u2019s me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees,\u201d goes the song \u201cAnti-Hero.\u201d \u201cSometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby / And I\u2019m a monster.\u201d"}
