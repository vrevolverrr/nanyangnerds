They should exercise social responsibility by performing an ART.\nThe change in health protocols for the two groups is part of MOH's regular review of the increased risk of severe infections among vulnerable people, said Singapore\u2019s director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference held by the ministry on Saturday.\nHe added that paediatricians and gynaecologists had looked into the cases of infants and pregnant women who have been admitted to hospital and assessed that the patients could be safely monitored at home.\nThe change is beneficial as it reduces the number of hospital admissions and people needing to stay in hospitals, he said.\n\"Surely it's more pleasant to keep children in homes with their parents rather than being in the hospital in a very strange environment which they are very frightened of,\" he added.\nThe ministry said these patients should continue to monitor themselves closely for signs and symptoms of concern such as shortness of breath, chest pain or persistent fever above 38 deg C while recovering at home.\nIf signs and symptoms worsen, they should see a doctor, it added.\nMeanwhile, about 3,000 patients with a high level of needs but not required to be hospitalised have safely recovered at home with the support of hospitals' outreach programmes, said Associate Professor Mak.\n\"Infectious diseases doctors now have greater confidence that more patients with risk factors for severe infection may be safely monitored out of the hospital, whether at home or in the Covid-19 treatment facilities,\" he added.\n\"And therefore, we continue to tweak our admission criteria based on our continuing-to-evolve experience so that more patients may recover and be monitored safely at home.\"\nFor Covid-19 patients recovering at home, telehealth services will be expanded to provide greater support, he said.\nOral antiviral medications made available earlier this year for vulnerable patients and for those recovering at home will also help to further reduce risk of deterioration, he added."}
