Two SCDF cars and an ambulance were also present.\nAbout 50 people \u2013 mostly tenants and those working in the building who were evacuated \u2013 were outside the building.\nThe affected carpark is linked to The Projector. The cinema\u2019s venue hire executive Jacob Chio said he learnt of the fire after a morning event at the cinema.\nA friend who was leaving the building at about 1.05pm told him that she had heard some explosion sounds in the area.\nHe went to the ground floor outside the building to check out the situation, and saw that the police and SCDF had already started to stream in.\n\u201cFrom where we stood below, we thought the fire was coming from the hotel next door, so we thought we weren\u2019t affected and went back up to resume operations,\u201d said Mr Chio, adding that the building\u2019s fire alarm did not go off.\nTo be safe, he decided to check the carpark and was faced with the blazing cars. \u201cIt was scary,\u201d he said, adding that he was shocked by the surreal sight.\nHe recognised the flaming cars as a fleet belonging to a rental car company operating out of Golden Mile Tower, but said he was not sure if the firm was still in operation.\nThe team was also waiting outside the building for updates on whether the venue and equipment were affected.\nThe Projector at Golden Mile Tower cancelled all movie showings for Aug 31, but aims to resume operations on Sept 1.\nService at its Cineleisure outlet remains normal.\nMadam Anirut, who works at a food stall on the first level, was preparing dishes when her husband informed her of the fire.\n\u201cI was shocked when a lot of people around our shop were saying there\u2019s a fire so we rushed out,\u201d the 56-year-old told ST. \u201cI told my customers to just leave, there\u2019s no need to pay. Just get to safety first.\u201d\nMs Chen Hong Xiu, who is the landlord of three units at Golden Mile Tower and lives in a Housing Board flat across the road, said she was suddenly woken up by the sounds of explosion.\n\u201cI was so shocked, I thought it was an earthquake,\u201d she said, adding that she later saw the smoke and realised a fire had broken out.\nGripped with fear that people would get hurt, the 62-year-old quickly ran towards the building to help alert those inside.\nSpeaking to ST in Mandarin, she said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t think, I didn\u2019t even know what time it was. I ran over so quickly that I even forgot to put on my shoes.\u201d\nShe then dashed into the building, going to each unit one by one, shouting for everyone to evacuate.\nShe added that an ambulance was already on site when she arrived at the scene.\nThe police at the scene told ST that only levels one to five had been reopened as at 4.25pm. The other levels \u2013 six and above \u2013 had not been cleared yet. The carpark is located on level six.\nFlooding was also seen on the basement floor, with cleaners clearing away the water from the aftermath of firefighting efforts.\nGolden Mile Tower, a 24-storey building, was completed in 1974.
