The UN and the International Finance Corporation are among those turning to SWFs to fill it.\nThere are roughly 100 SWFs worldwide and they include those launched even by cash-poor countries. Some run assets, such as state-owned airlines or telecoms, while others facilitate foreign investment at home.\nThe top 10, dominated by oil wealth, control 90 per cent of the assets.\nSet up by governments, more than 30 SWFs, including seven of the top 10, back the Santiago Principles, meaning they pledge to make independent investment decisions, rather than taking direction from government, as a way of inspiring international confidence.\nMandates also include ensuring predictable returns \u2013 similar to those sought by pension funds that aim to safeguard rich-world workers\u2019 retirement pots.\nThis limits the scope to boost money for renewables, sustainable agriculture or energy storage.\n\u201cReturns are just too low,\u201d Dr Jim Krane, the Wallace S. Wilson Fellow for Energy Studies at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute told Reuters. \u201cThe sovereign wealth fund mandate is to maximise returns, so they look elsewhere.\u201d\nA source at one fund signed on to the Santiago Principles said that it could invest in climate goals but \u201con the rationale of investing for financial returns\u201d.\nThe UAE, whose COP presidency has come under criticism because of its closeness to the oil industry, used the talks to announce a US$30 billion climate-focused vehicle, bypassing some of its largest SWFs, which are signed on to the Santiago Principles.\nThe world\u2019s largest fund, Norway\u2019s Norges Bank, has evicted big polluters from its portfolio and created sustainable investment goals. A Norges spokesperson said it is in regular contact with other SWFs to discuss responsible investment, including on climate.\nWorking for change\nSources at the wealth funds, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly, say that internally they see increasing value in trying to green their portfolios, and even reach net-zero.\n\u201cEquity investments through SWFs are organically heading in that direction,\u201d one source close to a Gulf fund told Reuters.\nThe One Planet Sovereign Wealth Fund (OPSWF) Network is also working to create the framework that funds need to boost these investments, including by improving the climate data for all investors and by identifying what could help emerging countries attract private capital \u2013 including from SWFs \u2013 to their energy transition plans.\nMr Lawrence Yanovitch, the OPSWF coordinator, said that funds are \u201cstepping up their pace\u201d.\n\u201cWe see it in the way in which members are integrating climate issues into their portfolios by hiring expert staff and engaging in training and peer exchanges,\u201d he said.\nAt COP28 on Dec 4, IE University, the IFSWFs and the UN Joint Sustainable Development Goals Fund launched an initiative to connect African SWFs with sustainable investments, and to help attract private capital. They intend to eventually expand to other regions.\nIE\u2019s Javier Capape said the cash stagnation was temporary; the 66 SWFs\u2019 \u201cgreen\u201d deals in 2022 were four times that of the average of the previous four years."}
