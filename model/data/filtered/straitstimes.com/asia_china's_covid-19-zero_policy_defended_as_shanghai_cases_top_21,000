The ongoing restrictions have led to food and medicine shortages, with some apartment blocks in hard lockdowns for weeks.\nIt is fuelling growing discontent among residents over the policy, which is leaving China isolated as the rest of the world opens up and lives alongside the virus.\nLast month, Mr Xi reaffirmed China's adherence to the strategy, but said it needed to be adjusted so that curbs are not damaging business and the economy.\nWhile it is getting increasingly hard to suppress Omicron's spread, Covid-19-zero \"can not only reduce the harm of the epidemic to people's health and life safety, but also balance the relationship between social and economic development and epidemic prevention and control to the greatest extent\", the People's Daily said.\nThe policy is designed to \"achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the least cost\", the newspaper said, adding that Covid-19-zero is the best choice for China given that medical resources in some parts of the country are lacking, the vaccination rate is unbalanced and there is a large elderly population.\nChina watchers expect Beijing to stick with Covid-19-zero this year, as there is little appetite for the instability that would likely be unleashed if the virus were allowed to spread freely.\nThe nation is vaccinated with less effective domestic shots and the rate for those over 80 is lower than in many other countries, at about 51 per cent, officials said on March 18."}
