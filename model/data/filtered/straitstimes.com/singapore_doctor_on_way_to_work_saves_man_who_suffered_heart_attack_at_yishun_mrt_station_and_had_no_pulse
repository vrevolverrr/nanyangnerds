At the Yishun MRT station, he noticed a crowd at the bottom of the escalator. A man had collapsed and was gasping for air.\nDr Lim, who has been a doctor for two years, pushed through the crowd and introduced himself as a medical doctor. The man had no pulse by then.\nThe doctor immediately commenced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and directed people around him to call for an ambulance.\nSMRT station manager Kelvin Leong jumped in and instructed station staff to get the automated external defibrillator (AED). He also took over CPR while Dr Lim prepared the AED.\nDr Lim said he was stressed because it was outside a controlled hospital environment.\n\u201cIn a hospital, there are medical personnel. Everyone is trained, and they know their roles in the resuscitation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOutside, we have to try to make use of what\u2019s available and get the help of other people,\u201d he added.\nMr Leong kept up the chest compressions before Dr Lim administered the AED. Meanwhile, other station staff ushered the crowd away from the man.\nSoon, the man\u2019s heart started beating again.\nAt about 7.35am, paramedics arrived at the station and took the man to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.\nDr Lim then hopped on a bus and made it for his 8am shift.\nThe paramedics were surprised to see him again at the A&E department where he works. He had told them he was a doctor at the hospital, but did not mention he was working that day.\n\u201cThe paramedics said: \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were going to work, we would have given you a ride\u2019,\u201d he said."}
