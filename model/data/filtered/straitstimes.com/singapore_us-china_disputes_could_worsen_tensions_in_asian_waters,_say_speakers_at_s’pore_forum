There have been several incidents of near collision between Chinese vessels and those of other countries, and the situation there is \u201ccombustible\u201d, added Professor Koh.\nSpeakers at the forum also discussed issues such as whether China has shown restraint over Taiwan as well as India\u2019s role as a \u201cnet security provider\u201d for the Indian Ocean region \u2013 how it contributes to security there through activities such as military exercises and exchanges.\nThe one-day forum, established in 2009, was co-organised by the Republic of Singapore Navy and the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).\nProf Koh asked Mr Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), and American academic David Finkelstein to share their thoughts on the lack of communication between Beijing and Washington.\nBilateral relations have soured in recent years, and the superpowers have been trading barbs over issues such as technology, Taiwan and trade.\nDr Finkelstein, director of the China and Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Division at the Centre for Naval Analyses in Virginia, said he agrees that both countries and the region would be better off when China and the US talk to each other.\n\u201cI know that people in the Pentagon would be very anxious to have serious dialogues with friends in the PLA. And one of the priorities, as I understand, is risk management, in order to deal with all of the very difficult issues,\u201d he said, adding that these include Chinese activities near Taiwan and freedom of navigation operations.\nMr Zhou, who is a senior fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Centre for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, responded that although he is not optimistic about the US-China relationship, he is still hopeful that disagreements can be managed.\n\u201cEven if they don\u2019t trust each other at all, I don\u2019t believe this is the end of the world. Why? Because the Cold War example tells us that even enemies could actually talk to each other out of mutual fear. And China and the US are not enemies yet,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo we should have confidence in this relationship being manageable... We have to try very hard because peace has to be earned. It is still possible, because none of us wants to have a war.\u201d"}
