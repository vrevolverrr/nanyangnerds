Employers who are ready to grant the additional leave will be reimbursed by the Government.\n\u201cThis is also to give more time for employers to adjust, especially taking into account the existing economic conditions and manpower and operational challenges that many employers face,\u201d said Mr Wong.\nThis will be reviewed over time, and the intention is to make the additional two weeks of paternity leave mandatory in due course, he said.\nSelf-employed persons who have been engaged in a business or profession for a continuous period of at least three months before their child is born are also eligible for the additional government-paid paternity leave.\nMr Wong said: \u201cWith the doubling of paternity leave, I hope the message is clear: We want paternal involvement to be the norm in our society, and we will stand behind all our fathers who want to play a bigger role in raising our children.\u201d\nGovernment-paid paternity leave, introduced in 2013 for working fathers, was doubled to two weeks in 2017.\nTake-up rates were low when the scheme was introduced a decade ago, said Mr Wong. But over time, the situation has changed.\n\u201cToday, more than half of our fathers take paternity leave,\u201d he said, adding that studies both internationally and in Singapore have shown that children with more involved fathers have better physical, cognitive and emotional developmental outcomes.\nParents of young children will also soon be able to take more days of unpaid infant care leave, said Mr Wong. This will increase from the current six days per year for each parent to 12 days per year, in their child\u2019s first two years.\nAll parents of Singaporean children will be eligible for this additional time off if they have worked with their employer for a continuous period of at least three months, said Mr Wong.\nThis will apply from Jan 1, 2024, for working parents with Singaporean children aged below two years old.\n\u201cThis will give parents more time to bond with and care for their newborn, or to settle caregiving arrangements,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTaken together, these enhancements will increase parental leave for a working couple from 22 weeks to up to 26 weeks in their child\u2019s first year.\u201d"}
