Until she stepped down in 2023 to run for president, Ms Sheinbaum was known as a data-driven manager, winning plaudits for reducing the megacity\u2019s homicide rate by half, by boosting security spending on an expanded police force with higher salaries.\nShe has pledged to replicate the strategy across Mexico, where drug cartels exert widespread influence.\nMs Sheinbaum has also promised to continue generous social spending on old-age pensions and youth scholarships, even though the government\u2019s 2024 fiscal deficit is estimated at nearly 6 per cent of gross domestic product.\nWhile she has expressed interest growing renewable energy projects, she has also said she will ensure the dominance of Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil and power companies while opposing any privatisations.\nIn 1995, Ms Sheinbaum earned her doctorate in energy engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and then pursued an academic career, including a stint on the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which later shared a Nobel Peace Prize with former US vice -president Al Gore.\nShe launched her political career in 2000, when Mr Lopez Obrador, then-Mexico City's newly elected mayor, tapped her to be his environmental chief, tasked with improving the smoggy capital's air quality, highways and public transport.\nMs Sheinbaum served as the chief spokesperson for Mr Lopez Obrador\u2019s first campaign for president in 2006, which he narrowly lost.\nIn 2015, she was elected to run Mexico City\u2019s largest borough, Tlalpan, and became the capital\u2019s mayor three years later. That was the same year that Mr Lopez Obrador\u2019s third bid for the presidency ended in his own triumph, winning by a margin of more than 17 million votes.\nLast June, Sheinbaum bested her mentor\u2019s margin of victory, polling more than 19 million votes ahead of her closest competitor, who was also a woman.
