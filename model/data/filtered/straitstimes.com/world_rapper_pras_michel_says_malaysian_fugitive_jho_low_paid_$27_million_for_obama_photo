Michel said he initially agreed to help, but at a price.\n\u201cI basically asked for US$1 million to begin to think about how I would get this photo,\u201d Michel said as a lawyer questioned him. \u201cI was going to try.\u201d\nUltimately, Low paid Michel US$20 million over nine months, which led to the tycoon getting photographed with Mr Obama at a White House Christmas party, the rapper said.\nDuring the first three weeks of the trial, prosecutors alleged that Michel, 50, was driven by greed and pocketed US$18 million of the US$20 million that Low paid to gain access to Mr Obama.\nThey also say he made at least US$70 million more for his role in a scheme to lobby the Trump administration to drop its investigations of Low.\nMichel was later indicted along with Low, who remains at large and is believed to be in China.\nMichel said he never made any donations on behalf of Low and did not believe the political donations were illegal.\nBut on cross-examination, prosecutor John Keller got Michel to admit the money came from Low, and that the rapper reimbursed his friends for the political donations they made to support Mr Obama.\n\u201cOnce Jho Low gave me the money, it was my money,\u201d Michel said.\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s what the market is willing to bear. Give me my money, and I\u2019ll try to figure it out.\u201d\nMichel said the money was a gift, not income, and he was free to do what he liked with it.\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s free money,\u201d Michel said. \u201cI didn\u2019t work for it. I was having fun trying to get a photo for President Obama.\u201d\nMr Keller showed jurors letters that a lawyer for Michel wrote in 2019 to three friends who were straw donors, saying they should regard the money from Michel as loans, not gifts. Michel said he regretted the letters.\n\u201cThat was a bad idea,\u201d Michel said. \u201cI was scared. I just did something stupid.\u201d\n\u2018Party Guy\u2019\nMichel said he helped with a July 2012 fund-raiser for Mr Obama in Miami, where the entry was US$40,000 a head, insisting he used his own money \u2013 not Low\u2019s \u2013 to pay for three Haitian friends to attend.\nBut Michel said he could not convince Mr Obama\u2019s campaign to let Low attend that event or another one that September.\n\u201cMy understanding is that the campaign thought he was too hot,\u201d Michel said.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want the optics at that time. At that point, Jho Low was a party guy \u2013 Vegas, champagne, parties with Paris Hilton. The campaign just didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\nLow did not attend the second event, where Low\u2019s father sat next to Mr Obama.\nThat event was at the Washington house of Obama fund-raiser Frank White Jr, who asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination rather than testify at Michel\u2019s trial.\nJurors saw several photos of Mr Obama at the event.\nAfter Michel discussed the holiday party photo, he answered questions about his efforts to push the US to extradite Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, a vocal critic of Beijing.\nMichel said he met voluntarily several times with Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to discuss Guo and three Americans being held hostage in China, including a pregnant woman."}
