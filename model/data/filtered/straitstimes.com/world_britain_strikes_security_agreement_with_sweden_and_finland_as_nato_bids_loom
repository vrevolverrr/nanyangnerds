Yes,\" Ms Andersson told reporters at a briefing with Mr Johnson at the Swedish government's country retreat south of Stockholm.\n\"The support will be given on request by the affected country and may include military resources.\"\nSweden and Finland have also received assurances of support from the United States and Germany.\nThe British statement said the new arrangements would intensify intelligence sharing and accelerate joint military training, exercises and deployments.\nSweden and Finland already have close ties with Britain and are part of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a multinational military group focused on security in the High North, North Atlantic and Baltic Sea regions.\nBut the war in Ukraine has increased fears in Stockholm and Helsinki that bilateral agreements are no substitute for Article 5 of Nato's charter, which guarantees that an attack on one member state would be considered as an attack on all."}
