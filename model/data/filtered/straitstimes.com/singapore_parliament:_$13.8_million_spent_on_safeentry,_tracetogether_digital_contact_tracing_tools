Similar to the TraceTogether mobile app, the token works by exchanging Bluetooth signals with other nearby tokens or phones running the TraceTogether app.\nSo far, TraceTogether has helped to identify about 25,000 close contacts of Covid-19 cases, of which 160 later tested positive for Covid-19, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in a written reply to parliamentary questions from Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) and Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) on Monday (Nov 2).\nHe said: \"It has enabled the early identification and isolation of cases, faster than would have been possible with manual tracing.\"\nMr Gan added that the actual amount spent on contact tracing tools will depend on several factors, including the actual number of Singapore residents who need a token.\nThe Government will also continue to invest in enhancing the SafeEntry and TraceTogether tools, such as looking at ways to improve the convenience of SafeEntry check-ins, and acquiring more tokens to meet needs, he said.\nThe authorities have started to integrate the SafeEntry feature into TraceTogether tokens, and will continue to study how the two systems can be more deeply integrated, added Mr Gan.\nCurrently, users can scan the QR code on the back of the TraceTogether token to enter a venue that uses the SafeEntry system, instead of having to use their NRIC, he said.\nAbout 570,000 users have collected their tokens as at Nov 1, and about 2.7 million have downloaded the TraceTogether app, said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19.\nIt was previously announced that from Nov 16, all cinemas will require visitors to check in with the TraceTogether app or token. But the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office said on Monday (Nov 2) that those who have not yet downloaded the app or collected a token will still be able to check in with their identity card.\nThe compulsory use of the TraceTogether app or token to check in will also be extended to restaurants, workplaces, schools and shopping malls by the end of December, as Singapore prepares to enter the third phase of reopening.\nResponding to Ms He, who asked why TraceTogether will be made compulsory for certain situations, Mr Gan said there is a need to ensure comprehensive coverage of digital tools to avoid a resurgence of cases like in some parts of the world that do not have a robust contact tracing system.\nHe said: \"The effectiveness of TraceTogether increases as more users come onboard. We therefore encourage more Singaporeans to join the TraceTogether programme, either by downloading the app or collecting and wearing the token.\""}
