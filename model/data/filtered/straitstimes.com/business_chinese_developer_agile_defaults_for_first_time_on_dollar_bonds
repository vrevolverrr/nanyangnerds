The firm is considering all possible actions to address its debt issue, it added.\nWith total assets of more than 240 billion yuan as at the end of 2023, Agile has established a presence in over 200 cities in China and abroad and has more than 100,000 employees, according to its website.\nSome holders of the 6.05 per cent dollar notes due in 2025 said on May 13 that they had not received the interest payments, as the 30-day grace period neared its end.\nThe bond\u2019s offering circular defines an \u201cevent of default\u201d when non-payment of interest continues for a period of 30 consecutive days.
