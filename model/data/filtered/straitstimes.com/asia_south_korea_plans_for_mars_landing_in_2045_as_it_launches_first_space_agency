The country\u2019s first lunar lander is planned for 2032.\nSouth Korea became the seventh country to own an indigenous space launch vehicle and satellite development technology with the launch of the Nuri rocket in May 2023 that put a commercial grade satellite in orbit.\nThe agency will streamline policy and development functions shared among different government ministries and will bring under its structure the aerospace research institute that developed the Nuri and its precursor space launch vehicles.\nSouth Korea plans at least three more space launches by 2027 and aims to launch military satellites.\nMr Yoon\u2019s announcement highlights the increasing efforts Asian nations are putting into space programmes for practical reasons, such as honing rocket technology, and to bolster national pride.\nOn May 27, North Korea launched a rocket but failed to put its second military spy satellite in orbit, which it blamed on a new type of engine failing. But one expert noted the attempt as a \u201chuge leap\u201d in the heavily sanctioned country\u2019s race for space.\nSouth Korea, Japan and the United States condemned the North\u2019s launch as violating UN Security Council resolutions banning it from developing ballistic missile technology.\nChina\u2019s space programme has developed heavy-lift rockets such as the Long March 5, the Tiangong space station, unmanned moon probes and the rover Zhurong that reached Mars in 2021.\nIn January, Japan became the fifth country to place a lander on the Moon. In 2023, India became the fourth nation to land on the Moon, after Russia failed in an attempt the same month.\nJapan also plans a rover mission to Mars. REUTERS"}
