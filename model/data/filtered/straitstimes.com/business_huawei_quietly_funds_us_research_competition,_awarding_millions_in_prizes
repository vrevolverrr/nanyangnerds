All but the Huawei-funded competition \u2013 which awards US$1 million (S$1.35 million) per year, or 20 times the next most-lucrative annual cash prize on the site \u2013 list individual and corporate financial contributors.\nA Huawei spokesman said the company and the Optica Foundation created the competition to support global research and promote academic communication.\nThe spokesman said Huawei\u2019s name was kept private to keep the contest from being seen as promotional and that there was no ill intent.\nMs Liz Rogan, Optica\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that some foundation donors \u201cprefer to remain anonymous, including US donors\u201d, and that \u201cthere is nothing unusual about this practice\u201d.\nMs Rogan said the Huawei donation had been reviewed by outside legal counsel and won the approval of the foundation\u2019s board.\n\u201cWe are completely transparent with the funding and support of the foundation programmes with the Optica Foundation Board, the Optica Board and staff,\u201d she said.\nThe secretive effort in Washington stands in contrast with public initiatives by Huawei in several European countries.\nFrance and Germany, for example, are home to company-branded scientific hubs despite a European Commission recommendation that the company\u2019s equipment be barred from member state networks over security risks.\nOptica Foundation\u2019s 2023 annual report acknowledges Huawei in a section listing \u201chighest-level donors\u201d who have given more than US$1 million since the organisation\u2019s founding more than two decades ago.\nUS tech giants Google and Meta Platforms are among those in the second-highest tier of donors who have given US$200,000 or more.\nFearful of losing funding from federal sources, including the Pentagon and National Science Foundation because of security concerns, many US universities have told researchers in recent years to cut ties with Huawei. Schools have also beefed up policies requiring academics to disclose foreign funding.\nThe foundation\u2019s secret funding arrangement likely does not violate US Commerce Department regulations blocking people and organisations from sharing technology with Huawei, said Mr Kevin Wolf, a partner at the law firm Akin who specialises in export controls.\nThat is because such rules do not apply to the type of research the competition is soliciting \u2013 science that is meant to be published, Mr Wolf said.\nBut if Huawei were subject to Treasury Department sanctions, the activity probably would not be legal, he added.\nResearch security specialists said the lack of transparency underlying the arrangement nonetheless violates the spirit of university and US funding-agency policies requiring researchers to disclose whether they are receiving foreign money.\nThey also said some of the resulting research is likely to have both defence and commercial relevance.\nTopics the Optica Foundation singles out in an online post as being \u201cof interest\u201d include \u201cundersea and space-based solutions for the global communications grid\u201d and \u201chigh-sensitivity optical sensors and detectors\u201d.\nMr James Mulvenon, a defence contractor who has worked on research security issues and co-authored a seminal book on Chinese industrial espionage, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bad look for a prestigious research foundation to be anonymously accepting money from a Chinese company that raises so many national security concerns for the US government.\u201d\nMr Jeff Stoff, founder of the non-profit Centre for Research Security and Integrity, said funding the competition could effectively let Huawei influence \u201cwhat research projects it would like to see without having to contract directly with academic institutions\u201d.\nHe said the company could use the arrangement to recruit talent by sponsoring applicants of interest and acquiring intellectual property from their research in the future.\nHuawei optical expert\nHuawei has one executive on the competition\u2019s 10-person selection committee. Hong Kong-based scientist Liu Xiang is Huawei\u2019s chief optical standards expert, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nIn 2021, he published a book about 5G communications technology after spending more than seven years at Huawei\u2019s US unit Futurewei, the profile says. Prior to earning a doctorate at Cornell University, Dr Liu studied at the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Physics, which operates under the State Council of China.\nIn April, Dr Liu was advertised as a moderator of a virtual Optica session about \u201cthe cutting-edge technologies revolutionising connectivity between data centres\u201d. While Optica listed the panellists\u2019 employers \u2013 all major US tech companies \u2013 in event marketing materials, it described Dr Liu only as a fellow at Optica and another professional society.
