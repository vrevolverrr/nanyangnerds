Hall \u2013 a self-styled journalist who claims without evidence that the attack was orchestrated by British government agencies \u2013 for alleged harassment, misuse of private information and breaches of data protection laws.\nThe case bears similarities to defamation lawsuits brought against US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones by relatives of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting.\nTwenty-two people were killed and many more injured when 22-year-old Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb as parents arrived to collect children at Manchester Arena in May 2017.\nThe Hibberts\u2019 lawyer Jonathan Price said that Hall \u201cdoes not accept any of this \u2013 his theory is that it is an elaborate hoax\u201d.\nMr Hall has published a book, published videos and given talks in which he claims the Hibberts were not at the concert. He also filmed Ms Eve Hibbert and her mother outside their house in 2019.\nMr Price said the Hibberts were entitled to damages and an injunction to stop Mr Hall repeating his claims about the attack.\nMr Hall is fighting the lawsuit and argues that an injunction would be a disproportionate interference with his right to free speech.\n\"However unpleasant Mr Hall's published views are considered to be, they are protected,\" Mr Hall's lawyer Paul Oakley said in court filings.\nMr Hibbert is due to give evidence at the trial, which is expected to conclude this week.
