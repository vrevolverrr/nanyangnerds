So I likened that to our Singapore River,\u201d she said, adding that she wanted students to understand why the Czech composer Bedrich Smetana composed music about Vltava, the longest river in the Czech Republic.\nMs Sng, who is head of the school\u2019s craft and technology department, said this initiative helps to widen students\u2019 experiences with music and foster an appreciation for the arts, as watching such performances would be a first for many of her students.\n\u201cWe want to tell them that concerts like these can be enjoyed by anyone, young and old, and we\u2019re starting them young. For my students who are already in music CCAs (co-curricular activities) and performing arts CCAs, hopefully it will inspire them and get them to pursue their talents and interests, post-secondary.\u201d\nOne of her students, Myra Nur Nisrina, 14, said she enjoyed learning about the music pieces in school before watching the concert, and liked a piece called Rain Tree by local composer Chen Zhangyi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see a local Singaporean write orchestra music. The ones that I hear are usually from other countries,\u201d said the Secondary 2 student.\nHer classmate, Xavier Seah, 14, said he enjoyed listening to the live performance of Ma Vlast at Victoria Concert Hall.\n\u201cWhen they play the music in front of you, it gives you a sense that the music is alive as compared (with) watching pre-recorded music, which does not have the same feeling.\n\u201cThis first concert experience is very memorable, and I would like to go for more.\u201d\nCorrection note: This story has been edited for clarity."}
