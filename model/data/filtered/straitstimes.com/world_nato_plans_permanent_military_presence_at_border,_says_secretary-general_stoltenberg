Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a longer-term adaptation of Nato,\" it cited Mr Stoltenberg as saying.\nMr Stoltenberg, who recently said he would extend his term as head of the alliance by a year, also said in the interview that decisions on the reset would be made at a Nato summit to be held in Madrid in June.\n\"We have the time now until the summit to make more longer-term decisions,\" Mr Stoltenberg was quoted as saying. \"This is part of the reset which we have to make, which is to move from tripwire deterrence - which is the current concept - to something that is more about deterrence by denial or defence.\"\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the United States joint chiefs of staff, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday (April 5) that he could envisage permanent Nato bases in countries such as Poland, Romania and the Baltic republics to host a rotating troop presence.\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said this week there was no decision on \"permanent basing forward or additional rotational forces in and out\" or a combination of both. These are things that have to be worked out and \"we'll work with Nato on this\", he told a Senate hearing in Washington on Thursday."}
