It was just a regular day for me,\u201d he said.\nAttempts to access the portals were met with a message saying that data was not loaded.\nIn response to queries, a SingHealth spokesman said at 3.30pm: \u201cThere is currently an Internet access disruption affecting all public healthcare clusters. Services requiring Internet applications like websites are inaccessible. For appointments and billing services, patients can use the Health Buddy app.\u201d\nWhen contacted, a National University Health System (NUHS) spokesperson said on Wednesday night that it was alerted to the disruption in the morning.\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cServices requiring Internet applications, such as our contact centre, websites, e-mails and some features of the OneNUHS app were temporarily unavailable. Our patients could still manage their appointments via the OneNUHS app.\n\u201cAffected services are gradually being restored, and the majority are now available. These include the contact centre and e-mails.\u201d\nBoth SingHealth and NUHS said their clinical services were unaffected by the outage, and both are working with Synapxe on the issue.\nIn its late-night Facebook post, Synapxe said investigations into the outage are ongoing.\nServices requiring Internet connectivity at public healthcare institutions, including websites, e-mails, and a few Internet-facing applications, became inaccessible at about 9.20am, it added.\nInternet connectivity was progressively restored from 4.30pm, with most affected services restored by 5.15pm, Synapxe said.\n\u201cClinical services and operations at the public healthcare institutions, such as access to patient records and appointment systems, remained accessible and unaffected throughout the disruption, and patient care had not been compromised,\u201d it added.\nSingapore has three healthcare clusters that manage all public hospitals and polyclinics.\nSingapore Health Services, better known as SingHealth, runs the hospitals and polyclinics in the east, while NUHS oversees those in the west, and National Healthcare Group manages those in the central region.\nThe HealthHub website and private hospital websites in Singapore appeared unaffected.\nMr Kevin Reed, chief information security officer of cyber security firm Acronis, said checks of the websites that were down showed they shared similar IP addresses, which suggests they were hosted on the same server.\nHe said: \u201cThis is a worrying sign because all websites use the same location to keep them running, and they could all go down at the same time, and be unable to provide web services to users.\u201d\nHe added that the web outage did not cause doctors to lose access to patient information and allowed clinical services to proceed as usual \u2013 a healthy sign that the data was kept separate from the hospitals\u2019 private data.\n\u201cLike the DBS Bank outage, this event falls to a similar question, which is, whose responsibility is it when a service is down? The hospitals rely on third-party providers, which seem to not have done their job.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe all remember the SingHealth data leak from 2018, so it is understandable why people are cautious.\u201d\nDBS suffered a 12-hour outage on Oct 14, affecting digital services and automated teller machines. The outage happened because of a technical issue with the cooling system of its data centre.\nIn the SingHealth data leak in 2018, which was described then as a \u201cdeliberate, targeted and well-planned cyber attack\u201d, hackers stole the personal particulars of 1.5 million patients.\nOf these, 160,000 people, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and a few ministers, had their outpatient prescriptions stolen as well.\nIn the aftermath, Integrated Health Information Systems \u2013 Synapxe\u2019s predecessor \u2013 was fined $750,000, while SingHealth was fined $250,000 for the data breach.\nA Committee of Inquiry on the incident made 16 recommendations to better protect SingHealth\u2019s database, among other goals."}
