He lived alone and was hospitalised after a giddy spell due to low blood sugar caused him to fall. It likely happened because he ate erratically and would sometimes double dose on his diabetes medication on account of memory lapses.\nAlthough he was able to navigate his neighbourhood and manage simple finances before he was hospitalised, Mr Lee frequently felt giddy and fell often at home. His only relative was a sister who visited him once a month."}
