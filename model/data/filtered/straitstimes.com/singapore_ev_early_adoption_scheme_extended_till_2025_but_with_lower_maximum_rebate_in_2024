This is down from the present maximum savings of $45,000.\nFor a BMW i4 M50 \u2013 an EV in Band A2 \u2013 the combination of the two rebate changes would translate to an extra $15,000 in vehicular taxes. By contrast, a buyer of a cheaper and less powerful EV model such as the BYD Atto 3, which is in Band A1, would not have to pay additional registration fees after the rebates.\nLTA and NEA said most mass-market electric car models would get the same level of rebates as they do today.\nThe agencies added that as the industry develops further, they would review the rebates for both schemes that will apply from Jan 1, 2025, and make these public in 2024.\nMr Neo Nam Heng, chairman of diversified motor group Prime, told The Straits Times that taxi operators like his are concerned that new hybrid vehicles would cost more at a time when fuel prices are also rising.\nDr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Transport, said in a Facebook post that the schemes would narrow the cost difference between cleaner energy cars \u2013 including EVs and hybrids \u2013 and those with internal combustion engines.\nOf the 2,541 new cars registered in August, 68.7 per cent \u2013 or 1,745 units \u2013 were EVs and hybrids.\nLTA said that since 2021, the purchase of more than 8,000 EVs and taxis has drawn rebates from VES or the EV Early Adoption Incentive scheme, or both.\nAssociate Professor Alberto Salvo of the department of economics at the National University of Singapore said that apart from incentives to encourage petrol car owners to switch to EVs, the expansion of the charging network was also a major draw for consumers.\nOn the Government scaling back incentives for high-powered EVs and hybrids, he said: \u201cWhile preferable to powerful petrol cars, they still are polluting, and they take up precious road space.\u201d\nMr Kidd Yam, BMW Group Asia\u2019s director of corporate affairs, said Thursday\u2019s announcement would help the company better plan the introduction of new models.\nMs Sabrina Sng, managing director in charge of EV brand Polestar and sports car maker Lotus at multi-franchise motor group Wearnes Automotive, feels it is reasonable to expect the EV Early Adoption Incentive scheme to continue in some form, given that EV adoption is still low.\nMany hybrid models are set to be affected by the move, which will lower the VES rebate by $10,000.\nThis would likely make them less attractive to consumers in 2024, especially as non-hybrid and thus more pollutive models are typically cheaper.\nKomoco Motors, which represents Hyundai, said the reduced rebate, coupled with high certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums, would drive buyers away from opting for cleaner options such as hybrid cars and some EV models, which will become more expensive.\nSome industry observers have said the uncertainty around rebates in the lead-up to Thursday\u2019s announcement had been a key factor behind rising COE prices.\nIn recent weeks, dealers have been urging buyers to commit to their purchases before the present rebates from the VES and EV Early Adoption Incentive scheme were due to expire.\nThe observers expect dealers to continue using this pitch as the rebates will drop in 2024.\nThis trend, said Ms Sng, will continue until the end of 2023. \u201cIt is the COE price movements that are the most visible and powerful driver of sentiment in the market,\u201d she added.\nFrom January, Singapore will adopt the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) as the sole testing standard for new private cars and taxis sold here. WLTP is a stricter test that provides more realistic emissions results through a better representation of real-world driving performance.\nLight commercial vehicles adopted the WLTP on April 1, coinciding with smaller tax rebates under the Commercial Vehicle Emissions Scheme that kicked in on the same day.\nIn the three months leading to the switchover, commercial vehicle COE premiums reached record highs as traders rushed to register vehicles. This was to secure higher rebates and avoid reapplying for approval under WLTP.\nOn Thursday, LTA told dealers that unregistered passenger cars and taxis previously approved for sale without emissions values under WLTP would have to undergo approvals as part of the new protocol.\nIt urged dealers to submit their reapplications early to avoid delays \u201cin the event of an unexpected surge in the number of applications later in the fourth quarter of 2023\u201d, based on a circular published on its website."}
