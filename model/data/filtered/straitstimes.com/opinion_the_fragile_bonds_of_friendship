I was at that time not yet familiar with the language of instruction which was English (my dialect-speaking parents didn\u2019t see the need or couldn\u2019t afford to send me to kindergarten) which led my teacher to believe that I was somehow mentally impaired, what today we would call a \u201cspecial needs\u201d child.\nMichael didn\u2019t have that problem. Light brown hair and eyes, and a toothy smile, he was the only child of a Chinese mother and an English father who owned a small shipyard in Kallang Basin. Despite that initial language barrier, we got on."}
