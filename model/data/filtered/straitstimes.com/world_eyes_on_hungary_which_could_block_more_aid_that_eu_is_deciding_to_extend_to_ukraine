However, Hungary could block the measures.\nWestern support is existential to Ukraine as it fights against Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Moscow started the war two years ago against its neighbour \u2013 a former Soviet republic that now wants to join the EU and Nato.\nHungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban boasts about his ties with the Kremlin despite the rest of the bloc seeking to isolate Moscow over the war. Budapest already vetoed aid to Kyiv in December, and has voiced criticism over military assistance.\nThe EU\u2019s 27 national leaders convening in Brussels must agree unanimously to approve the aid to Ukraine from their shared budget.\nWith the stakes so high, the bloc has stepped up pressure on Mr Orban, though sources in EU hub Brussels said ahead of the summit they did not know if Budapest would agree to what the other 26 member countries are determined to do.\nHere is what EU leaders will discuss behind closed doors:\nBudget aid\nSources said that there was no deal yet with Budapest over granting Ukraine \u20ac50 billion from the bloc\u2019s shared budget until 2027.\nIn a bid to win Mr Orban over, the bloc proposed an annual debate on the matter, but not a full-fledged budgetary review that would give Budapest the right to veto each time.\nWhile formally separate, the discussion overlaps with a long-running feud between the EU and Mr Orban in which billions of euros that had been earmarked for Budapest in the bloc\u2019s shared coffers remain frozen over democratic backsliding in Hungary.\nShould Mr Orban stick to his guns, the EU is also looking at alternative ways of supporting Ukraine. Each of them, however, would be more complicated, lengthy or expensive.\nMilitary fund\nDraft summit conclusions have left open whether leaders will also pledge to put another \u20ac5 billion into a fund called the European Peace Facility (EPF), which has been used to bankroll donations of weapons to Kyiv.\nEU members have been wrangling for months over the future of the fund\u2019s role in military aid to Ukraine, with Germany suggesting the focus should now be on bilateral aid from individual countries.\nThe bloc\u2019s top diplomat said on Jan 31 the EU would fall far short of its target of sending one million artillery shells to Ukraine by March.\nFor its part, Hungary has stepped up criticism of the EU\u2019s military support for Ukraine, and has in the past held up hundreds of millions of euros in payouts from the EPF."}
