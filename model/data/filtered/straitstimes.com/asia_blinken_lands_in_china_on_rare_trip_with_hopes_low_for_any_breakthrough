They then shook hands in front of a Chinese and an American flag.\nAfter heading into a meeting room, neither Mr Blinken nor Mr Qin made comments in front of reporters who were briefly allowed in.\nChinese Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying, who is attending the meeting, tweeted a picture of Mr Qin and Mr Biden shaking hands: \u201cHope this meeting can help steer China-US relations back to what the two presidents agreed upon in Bali.\u201d\nMr Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their long-awaited, first face-to-face talks on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of 20 big economies in November on the Indonesian island of Bali, engaging in blunt talks over Taiwan and North Korea but also pledging more frequent communications.\nDuring his stay till Monday, Mr Blinken is also expected to meet China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi and possibly President Xi Jinping, seeking to establish open and durable communication channels to ensure the strategic rivalry between the two countries does not spiral into conflict.\nThere is an expectation Mr Blinken\u2019s visit will pave the way for more bilateral meetings in coming months, including possible trips by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\nIt could also set the stage for meetings between Mr Xi and Mr Biden at multilateral summits later in 2023.\nMr Biden said on Saturday he hopes to meet President Xi in the next several months.\nLast November\u2019s meeting of the two leaders on the Indonesian island of Bali briefly eased fears of a new Cold War but, following the flight of the alleged Chinese spy balloon over the US, high-level communication has been rare.\nThe rest of the world will closely follow Mr Blinken\u2019s trip, as any escalation between the two superpowers could have worldwide repercussions on everything from financial markets to trade routes and practices to global supply chains.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition on both sides that we do need to have senior-level channels of communication,\u201d a senior US State Department official told reporters during a refuelling stop in Tokyo en route to Beijing.\n\u201cThat we are at an important point in the relationship where I think reducing the risk of miscalculation or, as our Chinese friends often say, stopping the downwards spiral in the relationship, is something that\u2019s important,\u201d the official said.\nTies between the countries have deteriorated across the board, raising concerns that they might one day clash militarily over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own.\nThey are also at odds over issues ranging from trade and US efforts to hold back China\u2019s semiconductor industry, to Beijing\u2019s human rights track record.\nParticularly alarming for China\u2019s neighbours has been its reluctance to engage in regular military-to-military talks with Washington, despite repeated US attempts.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday before departing for Beijing, Mr Blinken said his trip had three main objectives: setting up mechanisms for crisis management, advancing US and allies\u2019 interests and speaking directly about related concerns, and exploring areas of potential cooperation.\n\u201cIf we want to make sure, as we do, that the competition that we have with China doesn\u2019t veer into conflict, the place you start is with communicating,\u201d he said.\nHe said he would also be raising the issue of US citizens detained in China on charges that Washington says are politically motivated."}
