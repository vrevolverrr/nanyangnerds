Such vaccines trigger antibody development but are not good in generating strong killer T-cell responses,\" he said.\nThus, he said, influenza viruses that \"drift\" genetically can overcome immunity to cause breakthrough infection and disease.\n\"On the other hand, mRNA vaccination produces strong antibody and T-cell responses.\"\nEven if the Covid-19 virus evolves to escape antibody response, it would still have to get past killer T cells to fully overcome the immune system, he said.\nThe long-term game plan for countries to live with endemic Covid-19 may include certain privileges for people who have an updated vaccination record, said Prof Teo.\nThis means that those who are unvaccinated or miss their booster shots may be subject to additional tests or inconvenience when they participate in activities involving a large crowd, he added."}
