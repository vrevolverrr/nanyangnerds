This comes just after an American guided-missile destroyer and a Canadian frigate sailed through the Taiwan Strait, while being tracked closely by China\u2019s navy and air force.\n\u201cSome people are talking about our ships apparently getting too close to their ships and their plane. But the real question is, why are they coming all the way across the ocean, to our doorstep? They\u2019re getting too close to our territories, to our territorial waters. It\u2019s certainly a disrespect of other countries\u2019 sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d\nMr Cui also criticised the US\u2019 tendency for unilateral actions, such as the sanctions it imposed on China\u2019s Defence Minister Li Shangfu in 2018 in connection with Chinese purchases of Russian arms.\nChina has cited the maintenance of US sanctions on General Li as the reason he did not meet his American counterpart Lloyd Austin at the security forum, which concluded on Sunday.\nDefence Secretary Austin on Sunday dismissed this as a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d by China.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that I\u2019m personally sanctioned in Russia,\u201d he said, before leaving Singapore for India. \u201cBut I can, if I want\u201d, still speak with Russia\u2019s Defence Minister, he added.\nAsked about quicker practical steps that the US can take to pave the way for talks, Mr Cui said wryly that \u201cnothing is easy in China-US relations, I can promise you\u201d.\nBut as an \u201ceasier\u201d start, more direct flights between the two countries should be restored, to pave the way towards more linkages, he said.\nAmerican airlines have yet to restore the number of flights to pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels, citing the cost and time savings that Chinese carriers accrue by flying over Russian airspace on US routes, and have supported US senators\u2019 urging of the Biden administration to stop them from doing so.\nWeekly flights by airlines on both sides are now in the low tens, down from 300-plus previously.\n\u201cThere are too few of them,\u201d said Mr Cui. \u201cOf course, Covid-19 was a problem. But now it\u2019s almost over. We have other obstacles. And the tickets are very expensive. But so many people want to travel. So, at least, we could have more flights. It is for mutual benefit, and I think this should be easier to do.\u201d"}
