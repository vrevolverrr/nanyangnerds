I hope we will send more dogs soon. They will all have good homes.\u201d\nGetting a dog ready to travel to the European Union with the necessary paperwork and vaccinations can take three to four months and cost around \u20ac1,000 (S$1,440).\nIllustrating the scale of the challenge, Turkish shelters have capacity for 100,000 dogs and little space for more.\nMs Sayar said it often takes years to find homes for the large, old and disabled dogs that form the majority in her shelter.\nCities are set to build more pounds to comply with the law.\nDali, named after painter Salvador Dali\u2019s three-legged chair, lost a leg when hit by a car as a two-month-old wandering the streets. Dali and nine-year-old Deezi lived in Ms Sayar\u2019s shelter for four years.\n\u201cWe wanted to support these dogs and find loving families abroad,\u201d said Mr Ali Okay, who volunteered to fly with them from Turkey to Belgium.\nThe animals were later taken to the Netherlands by NGO Animal Care Projects.\nThousands of Turks have protested against the law in recent weeks.\nStray dogs and cats can be seen in streets across Turkey and are loved by many people, who look after them, putting out food and water and erecting shelters.\nLarge strays sometimes sleep in shop doorways, with people gently stepping around them.\nIn response to the new law, some companies are adopting strays for their offices, a hotel on the coast built a dog shelter to introduce them to tourists and some vets are offering free vaccinations for those who adopt animals from the streets.\nTurkey used to trap and neuter dogs then return them to the streets. Critics of the new law say dog numbers would have been under control if this policy had been implemented properly.\nDali is now in a foster home in the Netherlands awaiting adoption.\nDeezi is settling into her new home in Haarlem and is relaxed and happy, said new owner Caroline Dieleman.\nShe was mourning the death of one of her dogs in June when she heard about Turkey\u2019s new law and decided to rescue Deezi.\n\u201cThe new law makes me feel sick physically but also powerless,\u201d said Ms Dieleman. \u201cThis was a little thing I could do... it is one dog only, from how many dogs. But one is better than none.\u201d REUTERS"}
