It\u2019s hard to understand how that can happen on our watch in our lifetime. So it\u2019s very, very sad.\u201d\nThe last temperature data point, from January to March 2024, was the highest on record and \u201chead and shoulders\u201d above any other year, Dr Henley said.\nCoral reefs protect shorelines from erosion, are home to thousands of species of fish, and are an important source of tourism revenue in many countries.\nAt least 54 countries and regions have experienced mass bleaching of their reefs since February 2023 as climate change warms the ocean\u2019s surface waters, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is not currently on Unesco\u2019s list of world heritage sites that are in danger, though the UN recommends it should be added.\nAustralia has lobbied for years to keep the reef \u2013 which contributes A$6.4 billion (S$5.6 billion) to the economy annually \u2013 off the endangered list, as it could damage tourism.
