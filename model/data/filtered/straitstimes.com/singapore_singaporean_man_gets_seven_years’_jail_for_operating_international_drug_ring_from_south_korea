Out of those nabbed, 69 were South Korean and 31 were of Central and South-east Asian nationalities.\nDeputy director of CNB for operations Leon Chan noted that drug trafficking is a cross-border issue that affects many countries.\n\u201cTraffickers increasingly use encrypted chat applications to advertise the sale of drugs to new clients and to arrange for the delivery of the drugs,\u201d he said.\nSenior Assistant Commissioner Chan added that the successful arrest is testament to the good relationship and close cooperation between agencies in Singapore and South Korea in tackling the transnational nature of drug trafficking.\n\u201cFor drug syndicate leaders and members who choose to feed their greed by bringing harm to our people in Singapore, CNB will spare no efforts to bring them to face justice in Singapore.\u201d"}
