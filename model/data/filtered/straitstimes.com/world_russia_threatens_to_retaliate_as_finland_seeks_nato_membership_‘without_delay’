Moscow called Finland\u2019s announcement a direct threat to Russia, and threatened retaliation, including unspecified \u201cmilitary-technical\u201d measures.\nIt came even as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine was suffering another big setback, with Ukrainian forces driving Russian troops out of the region around the second largest city Kharkiv, the fastest Ukrainian advance since forcing Russia to withdraw from the capital and north-east more than a month ago.\nNato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Finns would be \u201cwarmly welcomed\u201d and promised a \u201csmooth and swift\u201d accession process.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he fully supported Finland\u2019s choice to join the alliance.\nFinland\u2019s 1,300km border will more than double the length of the frontier between the US-led alliance and Russia, putting Nato guards a few hours\u2019 drive from the northern outskirts of St Petersburg.\n\u201cFinland must apply for Nato membership without delay, \u201dPresident Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in a joint statement, hoping steps to take the decision would \u201cbe taken rapidly within the next few days\u201d.\nAsked whether Finland\u2019s accession posed a direct threat to Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cDefinitely. Nato expansion does not make our continent more stable and secure.\n\u201cThis cannot fail to arouse our regret, and is a reason for corresponding symmetrical responses on our side,\u201d Peskov added.\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry said Moscow would be forced to take \u201cretaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature\u201d, giving no further details.\nRussian officials have spoken in the past about potential measures including stationing nuclear-armed missiles on the Baltic Sea.\n\u2018Look at the mirror\u2019\nAsked on Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining Nato, Niinisto said: \u201cMy response would be that you caused this. Look at the mirror.\u201d\nFive diplomats and officials told Reuters that Nato allies expect both countries to be granted membership quickly, paving the way for an increased troop presence in the Nordic region to defend them during a one-year ratification period.\nPutin, Russia\u2019s president, cited Nato\u2019s potential expansion as one of the main reasons he launched a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine in February.\nNato describes itself as a defensive alliance, built around a treaty declaring that an attack on one member is an attack on all, granting US allies the protection of Washington\u2019s superpower might including its nuclear arsenal.\nMoscow regards that as a threat to its security. But Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine has changed Nordic public opinion, with political parties that had long backed neutrality now embracing the view that Russia is a menace.\nFinland in particular has centuries of uneasy history in Russia\u2019s shadow. Ruled by the Russian empire from 1809-1917, it fought off Soviet invasions on the eve of World War II, and accepted some Soviet influence as the price of avoiding taking sides in the Cold War. Since it and Sweden joined the EU in 1995, they have aligned more firmly with the West.\nUkranian counter-attack\nThursday also saw an intensification of disputes over Russian supplies of energy to Europe \u2013 still Moscow\u2019s biggest source of funds and Europe\u2019s biggest source of heat and power.\nMoscow said it would halt gas flows to Germany through the main pipeline over Poland, while Kyiv said it would not reopen a pipeline route it shut this week unless it regains control of areas from pro-Russian fighters. Prices for gas in Europe surged.\nReuters journalists have confirmed that Ukraine is now in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets River, around 40km east of Kharkiv. To the north, the Ukrainians have been pushing towards the Russian border. In the latest advance, they announced on Wednesday the recapture of the village of Pytomnyk, halfway to the frontier.\n\u201cThe withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kharkiv Oblast (region) is a tacit recognition of Russia\u2019s inability to capture key Ukrainian cities where they expected limited resistance from the population,\u201d Britain\u2019s defence ministry said.\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said the Russians were regrouping to prevent further Ukrainian advances near Kharkiv.\nRussia\u2019s retreat has begun to make it possible for some residents to return to recaptured villages around Kharkiv. But areas remain littered with mines and booby traps. The invasion has displaced more than eight million people within Ukraine and the number of refugees to flee the country now exceeds six million, UN data showed."}
