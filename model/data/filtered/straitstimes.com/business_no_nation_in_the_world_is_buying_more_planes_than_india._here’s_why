Here\u2019s why", "tags": "business", "timestamp": "2023-11-05", "content": "NEW DELHI \u2013 No nation in the world is buying as many airplanes as India. Its largest airlines have ordered nearly 1,000 jets in 2023, committing tens of billions of dollars to a spending spree that is unparalleled in aviation.\nIn New Delhi, Indira Gandhi International Airport will be ready for 109 million passengers in 2024, as it prepares to become the world\u2019s second busiest, behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the United States. And this is happening in a vast country still heavily reliant on trains \u2013 with 20 journeys by rail for every one by air.\nThe enormous aviation build-up, with a surge of investment behind it, has pride of place in India\u2019s case for a greater standing on the world stage. As it moves up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, India is scrambling to meet the expanding ambitions of its ascendant middle class. Its airports present highly visible achievements.\nAir travel remains out of the financial reach of most Indians. An estimated 3 per cent of the country\u2019s population flies on a regular basis. But in a nation of 1.4 billion people, that percentage represents 42 million \u2013 executives, students and engineers who yearn to get quickly from here to there inside India\u2019s borders, and to gain easier access to destinations beyond, for both business and vacation.\nMr Kapil Kaul, chief executive of CAPA India, an advisory firm focused on aviation, calls \u201cthe next two to three years critical for achieving the quality of growth that India desires and deserves\u201d. Growth has so far been profitless. Now Indian aviation must prove it can make money.\nThe effects of the spending spree should redound across India\u2019s economy. Cargo comes with passenger traffic, and foreign investment tends to follow closely behind, Mr Kaul said.\nArrivals at the international terminal in Indira Gandhi airport are greeted by a wall of giant sculptural hands, their fingers and palms folded into the signifying shapes of the Buddha\u2019s gestures, looking both ancient and futuristic. In 2012, when they were installed, 30 million passengers passed through the airport. By the time the airport has expanded to its new capacity, another one will have been built from scratch on the other side of the city.\nIndira Gandhi International Airport is racing to get bigger. In July, it added a fourth runway and opened an elevated taxiway. The company that operates it, GMR Airports, took over in 2006, a time when all arrivals walked past cows lazing in the dust to reach a taxi stand. By 2018, the facility was rated as India\u2019s most valuable infrastructural asset. To spare the use of jet fuel, a battery-powered TaxiBot lugs idling planes around the tarmac. An automated luggage-handling system can sort 6,000 bags an hour.\nTwo beneficiaries of India\u2019s expanding aviation market are the world\u2019s largest airplane makers: Boeing in America and Airbus in Europe. In February, Air India, which Tata Group took private in 2022, agreed to buy 250 planes from Airbus and 220 from Boeing, worth a combined US$70 billion (S$95 billion). In June, IndiGo, the country\u2019s biggest carrier by passengers and flights, ordered 500 new Airbus A230s.\nThe bulk of the growth of Indian aviation has been among home-grown airlines, which have clocked a 36 per cent increase in passengers since 2022. Foreign tourist arrivals have been rebounding since the pandemic, but are still relatively scarce, barely topping 10 million in a good year (about the same as Romania). So low-cost carriers are adding new countries to their destinations in order to accommodate India\u2019s demand for foreign tourism. Azerbaijan, Kenya and Vietnam are all a direct flight from Delhi or Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital, for less than 21,000 rupees (S$342) one way.\nThe air corridor between Delhi and Mumbai was already one of the world\u2019s 10 busiest. Like Delhi, Mumbai has new airport terminals that would be the envy of any city in America, not to mention the glorious new all-bamboo Terminal 2 at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru, a city in southern India. But the expansion in infrastructure is not limited to the country\u2019s premier metropolitan areas.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government likes to point out that the number of airports has doubled in the nine years since he took office, to 148 from 74. Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said there would be at least 230 by 2030. The government has invested more than US$11 billion in airports over the past decade, and Mr Scindia has promised another US$15 billion.\nThat means that sleepy towns such as Darbhanga, a former principality in the impoverished state of Bihar in eastern India, now have non-stop access to Delhi, Bengaluru and beyond. For many of the 900 travellers a day who fill its flights, including plenty from nearby Nepal, the new airport has transformed the journey.\nMr Prasanna Kumar Jha, 52, was born in Darbhanga but works in Delhi as a tax consultant. \u201cWho ever expected that Darbhanga would be on the air map?\u201d he asked. Flying to his home town on short notice to see his ailing mother cost him 10,500 rupees, which pinched.\n\u201cBut if you calculate the alternative \u2013 by train from Delhi and then taxi to Darbhanga \u2013 it will take at least 30 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cThe plane journey is no longer a luxury but a necessity.\u201d\nDarbhanga\u2019s airport is a far cry from New Delhi\u2019s. There is no parking lot. Passengers walk from the edge of a highway past a checkpoint to wait on benches outside the terminal. Then they wait on another set of outdoor benches after clearing the security check. But it works.\nAnother passenger on the same flight at Darbhanga, Mr Ajay Jha, was cradling his one-year-old daughter, Saranya, as he stood near the rudimentary baggage claim. His family was on the last leg of a trip that started in Bellevue, Washington, where he works as an engineer for Amazon, to a family reunion in the Bihari countryside. Travelling halfway around the world took less time than Mr Jha used to spend getting home from his school in Bengaluru.\nYet a vast majority of Indians cannot afford such conveniences. The annual mean income is still less than a single economy-class fare from the United States, and, in this top-heavy economy, most Indians earn much less than that. Middle class, in Indian parlance, indicates somewhere close to the top of the pyramid.\nA report by CAPA India counted just 0.13 passenger seats per capita in 2019 for Indians, compared with 0.52 for Chinese and 3.03 for Americans. But aviation companies and India\u2019s elected officials look at the low penetration and see opportunity.\nA scarcity of competition, in the face of an emerging duopoly between IndiGo and the Tata-led airlines, is one of the new landscape\u2019s most striking features. Smaller competitors keep going bust, most recently Go First, which declared bankruptcy in May. A shortage of pilots, after dozens were poached by bigger companies, forced Akasa Air, a promising upstart, to cancel flights in August.\nBut supply shortages are not the worst kind of problem to have in today\u2019s global economy. With aviation\u2019s growth in the decade before the pandemic steady at about 15 per cent a year, the Indian boom seems all but guaranteed to change the future of aviation worldwide. If the benefits accruing to the winners in India\u2019s economy can be coaxed into trickling outwards and downwards, the same could go for many other sectors. NYTIMES"}
