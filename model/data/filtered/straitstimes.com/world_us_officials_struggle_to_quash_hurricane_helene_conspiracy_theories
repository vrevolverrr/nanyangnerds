Others accuse the administration of US President Joe Biden of using federal disaster funds to help illegal migrants in the country, or suggest officials are deliberately abandoning bodies in the clean-up.\nRepublican Congress member Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on social media platform X on Oct 3: \u201cYes they can control the weather. It\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can\u2019t be done.\u201d\nThe conspiracy theories come at a pivotal time for rescue and recovery efforts following the storm, one of the deadliest US hurricanes this century. In addition, the presidential election between Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris is just over a month away.\nRepublicans and Democrats alike say the rumors are causing problems.\n\u201cI just talked to one Senator that has had 15 calls today about why we don\u2019t stop... \u2018fill in the blank\u2019,\u201d said Mr Kevin Corbin, a Republican in the North Carolina Senate \u2013 a state that is one of the hardest hit by Helene.\n\u201cNinety-eight per cent chance it\u2019s not true and if it is a problem, somebody is aware and on it,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\n\u201cI\u2019m growing a bit weary of intentional distractions,\u201d he added.\nWhite House officials on Oct 4 accused some Republican leaders and conservative media outlets of intentionally peddling rumours to divide Americans in a way that could harm disaster relief efforts.\n\u201cDisinformation of this kind can discourage people from seeking critical assistance when they need it most,\u201d a White House memo said. \u201cIt is paramount that every leader, whatever their political beliefs, stops spreading this poison.\u201d\nThe memo highlighted a claim by Trump during a rally this week that Mr Biden and Ms Harris had used federal emergency funds \u201con people that should not be in our country\u201d.\n\u201cThis is false,\u201d the memo said. \u201cNo disaster relief funding at all was used to support migrants housing and services. None. At. All.\u201d\nIn response to a request for comment for this article, the Trump campaign repeated accusations that Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) funds had been spent on housing illegal migrants in the country.\nFema has the funds for immediate response and recovery efforts for Helene, the White House memo said, and has provided millions of dollars in relief to those recovering.\nFema has been the target of so many falsehoods that it has set up a rumour response page on its website to try to tamp them down."}
