The sprinkler system was also activated, said an SCDF spokesman.\nAbout 20 people got out of the building before firefighters arrived, and there were no reported injuries.\nThe spokesman added that SCDF deployed an unmanned firefighting robot for damping-down operations to cool the batteries and expect it to be a prolonged operation.\nThe data centre is owned by real estate company Digital Realty. In response to queries, the company\u2019s spokeswoman said a fire alarm was triggered inside the SIN11 data centre at 7.45am.\nThe response protocol was deployed, and all workers at the site were evacuated by 8.15am, she added.\n\u201cWe swiftly notified and advised impacted customers to activate their business continuity plans,\u201d she said.\nW.Media, a tech publisher that focuses on data centre news, reported that the fire had led to \u201csignificant disruptions\u201d for services hosted by tech companies like online retail giant Lazada and ByteDance, the parent company of video-sharing platform TikTok.\nByteDance declined to comment, and The Straits Times has contacted Lazada for details.\nIn a statement on its website, Alibaba Cloud \u2013 an arm of the China-based online retail giant Alibaba \u2013 said at 10.20am on Sept 10 that it detected \u201cnetwork access anomalies\u201d, which caused some cloud services to function abnormally.\nIt later added that the abnormality was caused by the explosion of lithium batteries, which led to a fire and elevated temperatures.\nAn Alibaba Cloud spokesman said the company\u2019s key focus is to minimise the impact of the disruption. He added that engineers are working with affected customers to restore normal services as soon as possible."}
