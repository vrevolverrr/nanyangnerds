Ms Azula, better known by her online moniker Azula Cinta, said: \u201cI wanted to remove my eyeballs \u2013 it was like needles were being inserted into my eyes.\u201d\nMs Azula, who has more than 109,000 followers on TikTok, took to the short-video app to warn people about her experience. In the May 18 video, which has since gained 14.7 million views, her eyes are bloodshot and watery, and the whites of her eyes are swollen.\nShe visited the doctor the next day and was told the reaction was because of an infection caused by the lenses. She discarded them immediately and was prescribed antibiotics and special eye drops to treat the problem.\nChecks by The Straits Times found several online sellers from countries such as China, Thailand and Malaysia listing contact lenses at significantly lower prices than those found at optical shops here.\nFor example, a pair of brown lenses, which is advertised as being able to last for three months or longer, sells for $3.60. Other lenses on various platforms are listed under $10.\nIn comparison, a pack of 30 powered daily lenses from the brand Acuvue, which will last for 15 uses, sells for about $37 at most optical stores, while non-powered dailies can cost upwards of $15.\nMs Claudia Quek, 28, bought a pair of green contact lenses from an online seller in May to try out for her upcoming wedding, as she did not want to wear spectacles.\nAfter the senior account executive in the public relations sector wore them for about two hours, her eyes became red and teary, and eventually her vision got blurry.\n\u201cI went to the doctor and was given an earful. I have sworn off contact lenses now,\u201d said Ms Quek, adding that she has decided to wear spectacles for her wedding.\nIn response to queries, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said powered contact lenses meant to correct vision problems are regulated as medical devices.\nThese products have to be registered with HSA to ensure they meet safety, performance and quality standards. Importers and wholesalers of powered contact lenses must be licensed by HSA.\nThe Optometrists and Opticians Board (OOB), under the Ministry of Health (MOH), requires all contact lenses \u2013 both powered and non-powered \u2013 to be prescribed and dispensed only by registered optometrists or contact lens practising opticians, HSA added.\nThe agency said it has received feedback from users who experienced serious eye-related conditions like pain and blurred vision after using unregistered or counterfeit contact lenses, but it did not disclose the volume of feedback.\nHSA said it works closely with MOH and OOB to tackle the illegal supply and sale of contact lenses. MOH issued warnings between 2021 and 2023 to 31 people found to have prescribed, supplied or dispensed contact lenses without the required qualifications.\nDuring the same period, HSA detected 203 product listings selling unregistered contact lenses on local e-commerce and social media platforms, which were taken down promptly after it worked with the administrators of such platforms.\nBetween 2021 and 2023, HSA took enforcement actions including issuing warnings and composition notices to 19 people for supplying unregistered contact lenses.\nIt said: \u201cTo further tackle the illegal supply of contact lenses online, HSA collaborates with local e-commerce and social media platforms to educate them on the regulatory requirements.\n\u201cHSA and MOH have also rolled out educational campaigns to raise public awareness on the dangers of buying contact lenses from dubious sources, including online platforms.\u201d\nDr Leo Seo Wei, an ophthalmologist at Dr Leo Adult and Paediatric Eye Specialist in Mount Elizabeth Hospital, noted an increase in cases of people suffering from contact lens complications after a surge in online shopping during the pandemic.\n\u201cI would say I see at least one case a month,\u201d she said, adding that she used to see about eight cases a year before the pandemic.\nDr Leo advises consumers to buy contact lenses only from certified eye-care professionals who can provide a proper fitting and ensure the lenses meet safety standards. This reduces the risk of eye infections and other complications.\nSome short-term effects of wearing contact lenses bought from non-certified sources include redness, conjunctivitis, allergic reactions, corneal abrasions and infections, she said, adding that severe corneal infections or ulcers can lead to blindness.\nMs Azula said she has learnt her lesson. \u201cThe best thing we can do is to not gamble on our sight. I was really lucky I did not go blind,\u201d she added."}
