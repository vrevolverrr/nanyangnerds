It topped the US$29.7 million analysts had predicted.\nGrab said its adjusted profit was due to growth in on-demand gross merchandise value (GMV) and revenue, and lower regional corporate costs.\nIt marked the ninth straight quarter of sequential improvement in adjusted core profit.\nRevenue rose 24 per cent to US$653 million, higher than analysts\u2019 estimates of US$642.4 million, per London Stock Exchange Group data.\nSales from the food delivery business \u2013 its largest \u2013 grew 19 per cent, and the ride-share business 27 per cent, both topping analysts\u2019 consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.\nThe Singapore-based company is trying to reach sustained profitability after years of spending to grow its market share and fend off competition.\nYet, Indonesia\u2019s GoTo Group is proving a tough rival, keeping prices low and margins thin for both companies as they battle it out in the South-east Asian market of hundreds of millions of people.\nThe company is betting new initiatives, including digital banking, will boost its earnings going forward. Grab, which has partnered with financial services firms for online lending and banking in Malaysia and Singapore, expects revenues from those businesses to increase in the coming years.\nMr Anthony Tan, co-founder and group chief executive of Grab, said: \u201cOur focus on product-led growth is bearing fruit, with on-demand GMV scaling to new highs in spite of the seasonal impact we usually see in the first quarter of the year.\n\u201cOur push on affordability and reliability is pulling more people onto our platform and driving up order frequency. We also continue to see our partner earnings trending up.\u201d\nNew York-listed Grab shares rose 1.7 per cent to US$3.66 in after-hours trading on May 15, after the release of the company\u2019s results.\nThe shares are still down about two-thirds since Grab went public through a deal with a US blank-cheque company in late 2021.
