Lacklustre global import demand and ample stocks in leading producing regions continued to weigh on the sector.\nMeat prices dipped 1 per cent.\nIn a separate report on cereal supply and demand, the agency forecast world cereal production in 2023 at 2.819 billion tonnes, up slightly from a previous estimate of 2.815 billion and some 0.9 per cent higher than 2022 levels, the FAO said.\nThe higher forecast was almost entirely driven by more positive yield estimates for Russia and Ukraine, owing to continued favourable weather conditions, it added.\nThe agency said its cereal supply and demand brief pegged global wheat output at 785 million tonnes, coarse grain production at 1.511 billion tonnes, up 2.7 per cent from 2022 and world rice output at 523.1 million tonnes.
