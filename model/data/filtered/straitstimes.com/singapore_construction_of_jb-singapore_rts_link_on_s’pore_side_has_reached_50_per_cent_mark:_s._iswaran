Iswaran gave this update on Thursday at a media conference with his Malaysian counterpart Anthony Loke after they visited an RTS Link construction site in Johor Bahru for the marine piers of a rail viaduct that will span the Strait of Johor.\nMr Loke told reporters that work on Malaysia\u2019s side is 36 per cent complete.\nMr Iswaran said: \u201cBased on the progress that has been achieved on both sides, we expect to be ready and on time for commencing passenger services by the end of 2026.\u201d\nThe RTS Link is a 4km-long cross-border rail shuttle service, with 2.7km in Malaysia and 1.3km in Singapore.\nConstruction on the Singapore side had hit the 45 per cent mark in March, and work on the foundations for the viaduct piers that the Republic is responsible for is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2024.\nMalaysia\u2019s portion of the viaduct that goes across the Strait of Johor is about 30 per cent done. This section of the bridge is about 750m long.\nA tender for overground viaducts and other structures in Johor Bahru was awarded in March 2023, and construction has begun, Mr Loke said.\nThe next significant milestone for the RTS Link project is the completion of a portion of the rail viaduct that will connect both sides of the bridge.\nPrime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong and Anwar Ibrahim will commemorate this milestone in early 2024, said Mr Iswaran.\nThe aim is to hand over the rail infrastructure on both the Singapore and Malaysia sides to the service operator RTS Operations for track and systems work by December 2024. RTS Operations is a joint venture formed in 2020 between Singapore rail operator SMRT and Malaysian public transport firm Prasarana.\nSaid Mr Loke: \u201cFrom the beginning, we knew that this project would come with challenges in many ways. Unexpected historic events occurred one after another within a short period of time. Government changed, Covid-19 pandemic, then government changed, again. Yet, the project is on track.\u201d\nMalaysia remains fully committed to completing the RTS Link, Mr Loke said.\nHe added that the RTS Link will give workers who commute between Malaysia and Singapore by motorcycle a safer, greener and more reliable transport option.\nMr Iswaran said the RTS Link is an important bilateral project that will help to alleviate congestion on the Causeway and improve connectivity between Singapore and Johor Bahru.\n\u201cMore importantly, it will also strengthen ties between our two countries and our peoples,\u201d he added.\nMr Loke said the two countries discussed increasing cross-border ferry services, adding that he has also requested that Singapore consider adding on to the current Tebrau Shuttle train service between Woodlands Train Checkpoint and Johor Bahru Sentral.\nCurrently, there are two ferry services between Singapore and Malaysia, one to Desaru and the other to Tanjung Pengelih.\nA third service between Puteri Harbour and Tuas has been mooted by Johor Menteri Besar Onn Hafiz Ghazi to ease traffic congestion at the Second Link.\nWhen the RTS Link starts operating, passengers will be able to travel from Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru to Woodlands North in Singapore, or in the reverse direction, in about five minutes.\nThe shuttle service can serve up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction."}
