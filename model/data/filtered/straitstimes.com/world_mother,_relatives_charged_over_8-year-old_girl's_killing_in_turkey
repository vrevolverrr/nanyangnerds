Another uncle was earlier charged with murder.\nPolitical parties and women's groups have held protests in various cities across Turkey to demand justice for Guran, whose murder triggered an outpouring of shock on social media, especially because of the number of relatives allegedly involved in her killing.\nGuran went missing on Aug. 21 from her village, some 10 km (6 miles) south of Diyarbakir. Her body was found in a sack hidden under rocks in a nearby stream on Sept 8.\nIt was not clear how she was killed, but media reports said the autopsy revealed she had lesions on her neck. REUTERS"}
