What would you do if you were us?\u201c he said.\nHe also criticised stilted arms deliveries, saying Ukraine was still waiting for weapons from allies to equip recently mobilised troops.\nAnd if Ukraine breaks the terms of use for Western-donated weapons \u201cthen they can say that we won\u2019t give you any more help \u2013 that\u2019s the risk\u201d, he said.\nMr Zelensky met French media at a school gym in the western town of Rivne, after being whisked from a gathering to hear grievances of local businesses and a meeting with local officials.\nMr Zelensky criticised the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to allow some Russian athletes to compete at the Paris Games under a neutral flag.\n\u201cLet there be bloodstains on it, and then let them compete,\u201d he said, calling the IOC decision \u201cpiecemeal sanctions\u201d.\nUnpredictable \u2018risks\u2019 from US\nWith uncertainty for Ukrainian forces looming over the sprawling eastern front line, Mr Zelensky also conceded that a neck-and-neck presidential race in the US \u2013 a vital political and military ally \u2013 presented further \u201crisks\u201d.\nWashington has provided tens of billions of dollars in military assistance for Kyiv since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nBut a victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump \u2013 who claims he will be able to force the sides into a negotiated settlement \u2013 would bring Washington\u2019s continued support into question.\n\u201cWe cannot influence any election,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cOf course, the United States is a challenge today. And there are risks that probably none of us can predict.\u201d\nThe Democrats\u2019 presumptive White House candidate Kamala Harris has echoed President Joe Biden\u2019s pro-Ukraine stance.\nMr Zelensky said his team had been in touch both with her aides and the Trump campaign.\n\u201cAs president of Ukraine, I must, of course, have a dialogue between my team and the Biden, Trump, and today, Harris teams,\u201d Mr Zelensky said.\n\u201cWe have to have all these contacts and talk about what our future might look like if one side or the other wins the election.\u201d AFP"}
