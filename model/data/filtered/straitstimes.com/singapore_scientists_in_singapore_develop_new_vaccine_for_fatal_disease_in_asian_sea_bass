It recorded a loss of $31.9 million for financial year 2022.\nIn May 2024, its head of its head of strategy and operations Tan Ying Quan told ST that the company had decided to exit farming in Singapore and shift its operations to Brunei.\nBut Barramundi Group has continued its research and development work in Singapore. This includes developing fish vaccines through its subsidiary Uvaxx, and a selective breeding programme to rear Asian sea bass that grows faster and is resistant to SDDV.\nThe new epitope-based vaccine, which has fewer side effects compared with traditional vaccines, was developed by researchers from Uvaxx and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star).\nThe new vaccine contains epitopes or proteins from specific portions of the SDDV that can be recognised by the fish\u2019s immune system once it is injected, said Uvaxx and A*Star in a joint statement on July 19.\nThese proteins can help the system elicit a targeted immune response to fight the virus.\nConventional vaccines use whole live viruses or inactivated viruses, which tend to bring about more side effects.\nIn addition, conventional vaccines require the growing and processing of whole pathogens, whereas epitope-based vaccines are created by working with only specific peptides, which is often more cost-effective and can leverage traditional chemical technologies for scalable mass production.\nThe vaccine can be integrated into routine operations at hatcheries, and administered to juvenile fish before they are transferred to the sea farms, where they become more susceptible to an SDDV infection.\nThe team is now looking to further refine the vaccine formulations and prepare the product for market launch in Singapore and other regional markets that have SDDV outbreaks, such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.\nAt the same time, the team is conducting commercial-scale field trials with local farm partners, while evaluating the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy.\nThey will also be obtaining regulatory approval and setting up the vaccine manufacturing process, according to A*Star and Uvaxx.\nWhen asked about the vaccine\u2019s cost, they said that this will be determined at a later stage when manufacturing, distribution and market issues have been finalised.\nWhile the vaccine is designed to target SDDV in barramundi fish, the technology and methodologies can be adapted to counter emerging viruses in other fish species.\nBarramundi Group\u2019s chief executive James Kwan noted that the epitope-based technology can help Uvaxx venture into developing vaccines against other viral fish diseases more cost-effectively than conventional vaccine providers.\nThe vaccine development was one of 12 projects that were awarded a total of $23 million in grant funding from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to develop the agri-food system and support Singapore\u2019s goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.\nDr Ngin Hoon Tong, senior director of SFA\u2019s science and technology division, said: \u201cThe novel SDDV vaccine is a promising development in our drive towards a more secure and sustainable food supply, and leverages Singapore\u2019s biotech expertise.\u201d"}
