He was re-elected to a second three-year term as Eurogroup president in January 2023.\nThe 49-year-old Dubliner has held one or other of Ireland's two budgetary roles for the last eight years, starting as public spending minister in 2016 before becoming finance minister a year later and returning to the expenditure brief alone in 2022.\nKnown for his prudent approach to the public finances, the politics and economics graduate spent 10 years working for consumer products maker Procter & Gamble in both Britain and Ireland before his election to the Irish parliament in 2011.
