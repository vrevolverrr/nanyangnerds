Some say we are not Islamic enough. I want to say that we must take the moderate and middle path, taking everyone into account. We are a Muslim country but we must think of others too,\u201d Datuk Seri Anwar said, in his speech at the opening of the congress late on Nov 25. \u201cIt is not possible for all the problems to be solved in a year,\u201d he said.\nHe also spoke on fighting bigotry. \u201cAs long as we are in power, we will not allow chaos in this country in the name of race and religion,\u201d Mr Anwar said.\nLeaders from his Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition and allies from the Barisan Nasional and Borneo parties sat on the same stage at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre (PICC).\nHe did not mention names, but the reference to race and religion was clearly targeted at the Malay-Muslim opposition coalition, Perikatan Nasional, which often harps on ethnic matters.\nMr Anwar\u2019s so-called unity government is struggling to gain more support from Malaysia\u2019s Malay-Muslim majority, but needs to balance any outreach towards them without losing his solid hold on ethnic Chinese and Indian voters.\nMr Anwar in his speech also pledged to eradicate hardcore poverty, and repair dilapidated schools and clinics, even as he addressed rising complaints about high inflation.\nHe said the government plans to switch to targeted subsidies aimed at helping the poor, by reducing blanket subsidies on items such as petrol and cooking gas that the government said benefited high-income Malaysians.\n\u201cBlanket subsidies are no longer relevant as the cost swells each year. Subsidies in 2022 totalled RM77.3 billion (S$22 billion) covering petrol, diesel, LPG, cooking oil, flour and electricity... this will swell to RM81 billion in 2023 if we don\u2019t resolve this immediately.\u201d\nThe opening ceremony was attended by some 2,400 delegates, 50 diplomats and over 1,000 observers.\nMr Anwar was sworn in as Malaysia\u2019s 10th prime minister on Nov 24, 2022. But since then, his popularity has slipped with higher decibels of criticisms over the slow pace of reforms, ever-rising cost of living and a weak economy.\nHis approval rating of 68 per cent in December 2022 had fallen to 50 per cent, said independent pollster Merdeka Center which released its latest survey findings on Nov 22.\nNearly eight in 10 of the 1,220 survey respondents said the economy is the top issue facing Malaysians today, as it has affected livelihoods.\nThe approval rating of Mr Anwar\u2019s so-called unity government has also dropped, from 54 per cent in December 2022, to 41 per cent in the latest survey that was conducted from Oct 4 to Oct 24.\nPKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli said earlier in the day on Nov 25 that speeches at the congress will be focused on efforts to develop the country, unlike controversial speeches at previous annual meetings.\nParty leaders will debate the PKR president\u2019s speech on Nov 26.\n\u201cI think the speeches\u2026 will be focused on the issue of nation-building and they may not be \u2018hot\u2019 and may be quite boring,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBefore this, speeches at the PKR congress would always be \u2018hot\u2019 and controversial.\u201d\nSeveral meetings in previous years devolved into brawls and chair throwing.\nBut this time, the atmosphere was calm and collected in the cavernous hall of the PICC that was completed in 2003 by former premier Mahathir Mohamad, who is now in the opposition camp."}
