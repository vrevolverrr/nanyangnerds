A total of 62.9 per cent said such offenders deserved death because they also harmed the lives of many addicts\u2019 families.\nSimilarly, in another study conducted by MHA\u2019s Research and Statistics Division (RSD) in 2021, 65.6 per cent of 2,000 respondents aged 15 and above said the death penalty should be mandatory for trafficking a significant amount of drugs. More than half (55 per cent) of them said it was because drug trafficking is a serious crime and a danger to society.\nRespondents who said they were neutral or disagreed with the mandatory death penalty (34.4 per cent) were probed further in the survey and asked to choose between a discretionary death penalty and life imprisonment as the more appropriate punishment for drug trafficking.\nOf these, 22.6 per cent chose the discretionary death penalty, 61.6 per cent chose life imprisonment, and 15.8 per cent said they did not know. A majority (67 per cent) of those who chose the discretionary death penalty for drug trafficking said they believed the authorities would be in a better position to decide on whether the death penalty should be given to the offender.\nRespondents who felt that life imprisonment was a more appropriate punishment mostly cited a preference for rehabilitating offenders, or were pro-life in nature.\nHowever, the studies also found that murder was generally seen as a more heinous crime justifying death as punishment.\nA total of 71.4 per cent of respondents in the IPS study and 80.5 per cent of respondents in the RSD survey felt that the mandatory death penalty was appropriate for those convicted of intentional murder.\nAs for firearms offences, 60.1 per cent in the IPS study and 71.1 per cent in the RSD survey felt the death penalty was appropriate.\nMHA said the studies showed most Singaporeans and permanent residents agreed the death penalty is effective in deterring serious crimes such as drug trafficking.\nThe IPS study found that 78.9 per cent believed it deters drug traffickers, and 70.8 per cent believed it is more effective in doing so than life imprisonment."}
