These will need to appeal to both tourists and residents.\n\u201cThe wellness attraction will be one of the key attractions in the precinct when completed, complementing other places of interest such as Gardens by the Bay, Founders\u2019 Memorial in Bay East and Marina Barrage,\u201d said STB.\nThe tender is open to both local and international bidders, and will close on Oct 4.\nWhen asked how the attraction will differentiate itself from offerings in established wellness and resort destinations in the region like Bali and Phuket, STB chief Melissa Ow said it would be \u201ca large-format development, and one which is within the context of Singapore as an urban destination\u201d.\n\u201cIt will play to Singapore\u2019s strength of convenience, and have a replete set of offerings related to lifestyle and leisure,\u201d she said.\nThe Marina South Coastal site, which is currently vacant, is approximately the size of six football fields.\nThe development will have a maximum gross floor area of 80,000 sq m, of which no more than 30 per cent \u2013 or 10,000 sq m of space, whichever is lower \u2013 can be allocated for commercial uses such as restaurants, shops, massage establishments and medical clinics.\nIt cannot be used for hotels, casinos and residences, among other purposes.\nThe site will be leased to the successful developer for 45 years, with the option to extend for 15 years, subject to terms and conditions.\nThe call for tender for the development of the wellness attraction was first announced at STB\u2019s annual Tourism Industry Conference in May.\nMs Ow noted that the global wellness market hit US$5.2 trillion (S$7 trillion) in 2022, and is projected to grow to almost US$8 trillion in 2028.\nA report on Singapore by the non-profit Global Wellness Institute showed that the Republic\u2019s wellness economy was valued at US$16.3 billion in 2022.\nSingapore is also up against more established players in the wellness space.\nThere are \u201ctop-draw wellness retreats\u201d in several major tourist destinations such as Switzerland, Thailand and Germany, which often come with stunning views of natural elements like mountains, lakes and beaches, noted experts like Mr Benjamin Cassim, a senior lecturer for the diploma in hospitality and tourism management at Temasek Polytechnic.\nOthers, like Ms Fattimah Ally, a senior lecturer at the School of Hospitality in Republic Polytechnic, said that despite not having these geographical advantages, Singapore benefits from its strong expertise in technology and healthcare.\nMr Cassim said this future, purpose-built wellness attraction in Singapore \u201ccan deliver curated wellness experiences and offerings as a competitive differentiator\u201d.\nOne approach could be to offer a \u201cmajor shopping complex\u201d type of experience where all the offerings are wholly dedicated to wellness-related experiences, services and activities, he said.\nAnother approach, he suggested, is the creation of a full holistic, immersive and one-of-a-kind wellness destination, or a destination within destination, where guests would commit to a three- to 10-day curated experience.\n\u201cThese retreat programmes would mean the wellness attraction would have to provide not just the wellness experiences but also accommodation and dining etc... An approach like this would necessitate a single operator being responsible for delivering the wellness destination,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWith any of the approaches, there will have to be considerations in areas of comfort, tranquillity, connections with nature, spatial atmosphere, respect of the senses and nourishment.\u201d\nMs Fattimah also suggested the inclusion of on-site accommodation offering holistic wellness programmes, citing the likes of the Chiva-Som resort in Hua Hin, Thailand \u2013 a destination spa where visitors need to commit to a programme, depending on the length of stay. Besides accommodation, participants\u2019 activities are also curated.\n\u201cThe attraction\u2019s proximity to the coastal area provides opportunities to create aqua-related activities such as kayaking, paddleboarding or aqua yoga classes,\u201d she added. \u201cOur accessibility as a destination within the region, as well as within the country, would also be another advantage that would make Singapore an attractive urban wellness \u2018escape\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cWith the rising demand for more restorative and wellness-related experiences, we believe Singapore is well-placed to be a leading urban wellness destination that prioritises holistic well-being,\u201d said Ms Carrie Kwik, STB\u2019s World Expo and special projects executive director, on July 5.\nShe added that the tender marks a significant stride towards realising Singapore\u2019s wellness ambitions, leveraging the Republic\u2019s existing strengths in accessibility and technology, and as a strong business hub.\nBesides giving travellers more compelling reasons to extend their stay and spend more in Singapore, Ms Kwik said locals will also get to enjoy the range of wellness offerings to be made available."}
