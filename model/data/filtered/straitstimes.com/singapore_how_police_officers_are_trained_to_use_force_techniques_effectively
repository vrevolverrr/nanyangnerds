This also reduces the risk of injuries to innocent bystanders from stray bullets.\"\nFor Tasers, officers use the Taser X26P which discharges 50,000 volts when successfully deployed.\nWhen an officer pulls the trigger, two darts, or probes, attached to wires from the gun will latch onto the suspect's skin and send volts of electricity through the body.\nThe surge of voltage can override the sensory and motor nervous systems and cause an uncontrollable contraction of muscles.\nThe police said that officers are trained to avoid situations, such as a fall hazard, where the person may be at risk of serious injury or death if the Taser is used.\nBut the effectiveness of the weapon is affected by the distance between the two probes, or when one or both probes miss, fail to embed properly, or get dislodged.\nWhat the target is wearing, the distance between the target and the officer, and the degree of movement by the target may also hinder a successful deployment.\nIf the Taser fails to subdue a suspect, officers are trained to use other options, including the baton or firearm, depending on their assessment of the situation.\nAside from using weapons, they are also trained in contact tactics which involve placing suspects in locks and holds.\nSupt Toh noted that officers undergo a six-month Police Officer Basic Course, where they are taught, among other things, police contact tactics, basic combat shooting, incident management, public order and public security incident management.\nThey must undergo annual re-certification tests and training to remain competent in the use of firearms and Tasers.\nSupt Toh said of the police using force: \"They will take decisive action, including using necessary force, to subdue persons who pose an imminent threat of harm to the public, or to our officers in the discharge of their duties.\n\"The Singapore Police Force continuously reviews the training, procedures and equipment of our officers to ensure that our officers can execute their duties effectively and safely in line with the security climate.\"\nFour shootings in 10 years and two Taser incidents in 2022\n2022:\nClementi\nOn Feb 17, a man, 49, was shot by an officer outside Clementi Neighbourhood Police Centre.
