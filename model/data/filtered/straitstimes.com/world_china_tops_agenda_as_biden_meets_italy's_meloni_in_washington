No one asked her about LGBTQ rights, she said.\n\u201cOur relations are strong,\u201d Ms Meloni said at the start of the Oval Office meeting with Mr Biden. \u201cThey cross governments and remain solid regardless of their political colours. We know who our friends are in times that are tough.\u201d\nMs Meloni also used her first trip to Washington to spend some time on Capitol Hill, where her meetings included a visit with Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who previously has said he could consider an impeachment inquiry into Mr Biden.\nRome and Washington both emphasised the trip as an opportunity to reaffirm a strong partnership between the countries, including over the billions of dollars in military and other aid the West has provided Ukraine in its grinding war against Russia since 2022.\nDuring a small portion of the meeting open to reporters, Mr Biden complimented Italy on its strong stance in Ukraine and Ms Meloni said she was proud that Italy defended international law in supporting Ukraine.\nWashington hopes that the West\u2019s alliance against Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion will help deter China from changing the status quo in Taiwan and the broader Pacific.\nMs Meloni faces a decision over whether to maintain Italy\u2019s membership in Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure plan, a programme that Washington has been working to counter.\nItaly in 2019 became the first and so far only G-7 nation to join China\u2019s major infrastructure initiative, with critics saying the partnership would enable China to gain control of sensitive technologies and vital infrastructure.\nItaly is seen as highly unlikely to renew the deal with China when it expires in March 2024, and Ms Meloni said in May it was possible to have good relations with Beijing without being part of the pact.\nThe G-7 formally launched an alternative to Belt and Road, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, last year. The countries said in May at their last leaders\u2019 summit in Japan, that they were trying to \u201creduce excessive dependencies\u201d on other countries but \u201cnot decoupling or turning inwards.\u201d\nThe Biden-Meloni meeting takes place less than a week after she hosted an international conference on migration in Rome, as Italy tries to cope with a high volume of migrants arriving by boat from North Africa.\nItaly was planning to discuss with the US how to support the development and stability of Africa, Ms Meloni\u2019s office said, which will also be among the main topics of Italy\u2019s G-7 presidency.
