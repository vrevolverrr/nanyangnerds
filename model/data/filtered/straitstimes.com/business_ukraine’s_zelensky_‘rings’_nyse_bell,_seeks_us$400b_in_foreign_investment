Traders applauded and whooped while a banner read: \u201cWe are free. We are strong. We are open for business.\u201d\nFresh from a roundtable with top executives from JP Morgan , Pfizer, and other US companies, Zelensky said in English that Ukraine was already rebuilding its economy, more than six months since the Russian invasion began.\n\u201c Ukraine is the story of a future victory and a chance for you to invest now in projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars to share the victory with us,\u201d he said.\nUkraine is also appealing for some US$5 billion in international aid each month to keep its economy running, in addition to military aid from Nato alliance members.\nThe United States and allies in Europe and Asia have already sent billions in humanitarian aid, weapons and other security spending, and officials are watching closely for any signs domestic political support could be flagging.\nJust over half of Americans said the United States should support Ukraine until Russia withdraws, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.\n\u2018Invest now\u2019\n\u201cAdvantage Ukraine,\u201d the investment push, focuses on 10 key sectors, including the military-industrial complex, energy, pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, woodworking, and logistics.\n\u201cIt is necessary to invest in Ukraine now, and not wait for the end of the war,\u201d Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in a statement.\nAdvertising group WPP is leading the marketing campaign for the initiative.\nSvyrydenko told Reuters last month that Ukraine\u2019s economy should stabilise over the coming year and expand by as much as 15.5 per cent in 2023, after a likely contraction of 30-35 per cent this year."}
