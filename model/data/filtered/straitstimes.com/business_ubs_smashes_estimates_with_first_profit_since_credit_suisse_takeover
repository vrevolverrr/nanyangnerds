It is aiming to achieve another US$1.5 billion in savings by the end of the year.\nThe first merger of two global systemically important banks \u2013 orchestrated by the Swiss authorities who feared that scandal-ridden Credit Suisse was on the brink of collapse \u2013 was completed in June 2023, after which UBS posted two consecutive quarters of losses due to the costs of absorbing its rival.\nDespite the shotgun nature of the takeover, investors have been upbeat about UBS\u2019s prospects given the low acquisition costs and its huge increase in assets. Shares in the bank have climbed some 40 per cent over the past year.\n2024 is expected to be a pivotal year for UBS as it tackles some of the trickier stages of integration such as combining separate IT systems and legal entities, as well as migrating clients from Credit Suisse to UBS.\nWith the merger, UBS\u2019s balance sheet has expanded to more than US$1.6 trillion, nearly twice the size of Switzerland\u2019s economy and worrying regulators who fear huge consequences should the bank run into trouble.\nSwitzerland\u2019s government recently laid out plans for how to police banks deemed \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and tougher capital rules are expected sometime in the next few years.\nUBS said its current financials will allow it to execute on its 2024 capital return targets. This includes a plan to repurchase up to US$1 billion in shares in 2024 as well as increase 2023\u2019s dividend of 70 US cents per share by a mid-teen percentage in 2024. REUTERS"}
