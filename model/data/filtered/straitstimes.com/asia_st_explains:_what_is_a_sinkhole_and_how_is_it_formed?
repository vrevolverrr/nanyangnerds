ST explains.\nQ: What is a sinkhole?\nWhile the word sinkhole is often used to describe any large hole that opens up in the ground, using it as a catch-all term is technically incorrect.\nStrictly speaking, The Geological Society of London says, sinkholes are \u201ca natural surface depression caused by dissolution of soluble rocks at depth\u201d.\nAccording to the British Geological Survey (BGS), this means these typically saucer-shaped hollows are caused by the collapse or removal of an underlying layer of rocks needed to support the surface layer of material.\nBut the shape, size and depth of a sinkhole can vary greatly depending on the composition of the rocks and different interactions which caused it.\nQ: How does a sinkhole form?\nSinkholes are commonly formed when the supporting underlayer of rock is naturally dissolved by acidic rainfall or groundwater circulating through it, causing spaces and caverns to develop underground, according to the US Geological Survey.\nCalled soluble sinkholes, examples of such dissolvable rocks include chalk, gypsum or limestone.\n\u201cWhen groundwater seeps into cracks and then pools beneath the surface, it wears away these rocks and leads to the formation of underground caves and other openings. Soil particles fall into these gaps too, enlarging the chasms and facilitating the collection of more water,\u201d National Geographic reported.\nAccording to the BGS, as the water drains from the hollows formed through the fissures or joints of the rock, it continues to dissolve the rock and gradually enlarges the depression on the surface.\nThe likelihood of sinkholes forming can also be accelerated by drought or heavy rain, as well as human activities such as heavy pumping of groundwater or construction.\nThe sides of sinkholes can range from gentle slopes to almost vertical edges, and can be shaped similar to saucer-like hollows, cones, cylindrical potholes and shafts.\nQ: How long does it take for a sinkhole to form?\nThe time taken for a sinkhole to form can vary dramatically.\nSinkholes formed on sandier soils where there is an existing void or cave underground tend to form more gradually and can even go undetected for hundreds or thousands of years, according to National Geographic.\n\u201cAs the soil above transports itself into that cave in the rock, the ground slowly subsides. So, it is not catastrophic. It subsides over time,\u201d the report said, adding that such sinkholes are known as cover-subsidence sinkholes and are the most commonly formed.\nBut the sinkholes that appear suddenly and make headlines tend to be a type known as cover-collapse sinkholes, which can happen in a matter of hours.\nThese sinkholes typically occur in clay rocks and form in a similar fashion to their slow-growing counterparts, with loose, unconsolidated soil leaching into a cave underground.\nThe difference in these cases is that the space in the ground starts to grow upwards, until the thin layer of soil above the void can no longer hold up the land and abruptly collapses, taking with it houses and roads.\nHowever, according to the BGS, sinkholes formed exclusively in this way are quite rare, with many sinkholes forming due to a combination of different processes.\nQ: Are sinkholes a natural disaster?\nAlthough sinkholes are generally considered a natural disaster and process, their formation can be greatly exacerbated or triggered by human influences.\nAccording to the BGS, the presence of broken drains, water mains and sewerage pipes, or modified drainage and diverted surface water can wash sediment into underlying materials, causing the ground to sink.\nIn 2022, tunnelling works by national water agency PUB involving a tunnel boring machine caused a section of Farrer Road to collapse and a sinkhole to form.\nThe machine works by cutting the earth in front of it and conveying it to the back of the machine, where it is transported to the surface.\nThe machine was later revealed to be undergoing maintenance when the ground in front of the tunnel face destabilised, causing the sinkhole to form on a slip road leading from Holland Road to Farrer Road.\nNo one was injured in the incident, but the road was closed to traffic for about a week.\nIn 2013, a portion of Woodlands Road caved in and resulted in a hole that appeared to be as wide as one lane, causing traffic on both lanes of the road to be blocked.\nThe affected area was next to where construction work for the Downtown Line 2 was being carried out by a Land Transport Authority (LTA) contractor, and the massive sinkhole was caused by excavation works for the line.\nThe construction destabilised the soil, which ruptured an underground water pipe, LTA said then.\nThe soil movement and pipe\u2019s rupture then weakened the ground under the road, causing the sinkhole to open up.\nMr Chong Kee Sen, vice-president of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore, told ST then that a mixture of soft soil and hard rock underneath posed a challenge, as Singapore continued to dig underground to build rail lines and lay pipes.\nReports said boring through soft soil could weaken and move the soil, which may cause the road to sink when it is heavily used."}
