This is why Singapore has decided to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance.\"\nSingapore is the first country in Asia to join, said the alliance in a statement.\nTwenty-eight new members - including Chile, HSBC Bank and Canadian utility TransAlta - joined the alliance on Thursday, bringing its total number of members to 165.\nIn the first half of this year, some 95 per cent of Singapore's electricity was generated with natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel.\nCoal made up 1.2 per cent, diesel and fuel oil made up 0.6 per cent, while waste-to-electricity, biomass and solar energy accounted for the remaining 3.2 per cent, figures from the Energy Market Authority show.\nCoal is the dirtiest form of fossil fuel.\nBy joining the alliance, Singapore has committed to continue phasing out the use of unabated coal in its electricity mix by 2050, and to restrict direct government finance of unabated coal power internationally, said the National Climate Change Secretariat and ministries of Sustainability and the Environment as well as Trade and Industry in a statement.\nUnabated coal power generators refer to coal-burning power plants that do not use technology to capture the emitted carbon for storage or conversion to other substances.\nSuch technology is known as carbon capture, utilisation or storage, and is an area of research that Singapore is looking into.\nMs Fu added in her video message that Singapore is fully committed to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon future.\n\"We will transform our industry, economy and society to be more energy- and carbon-efficient, and to adopt more low-carbon energy in support of the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" she said.\nSingapore faces a number of constraints in decarbonising its local power sector, which contributes 40 per cent to the country's total emissions. This includes the lack of land for large solar farms and inability to access other forms of renewable energy.\nBut the country is seeking to overcome these obstacles in other ways, such as by deploying solar panels on water bodies and by importing low-carbon energy from elsewhere.\nLast month, for instance, Singapore announced that it plans to import around 30 per cent of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as renewable energy plants, by 2035.\nOther than joining the alliance, Singapore also signed on Thursday the Global Coal to Clean Power transition statement initiated by the British presidency of COP26 to accelerate international momentum for the global energy transition.\nThe statement commits to international efforts and collaboration in shifting away from unabated coal power generation in the 2040s, or as soon as possible thereafter, and in ceasing issuance of new permits, as well as ending direct government support for new unabated coal-fired power generation projects worldwide.\n\"Effective international cooperation is needed to tackle climate change, a complex global challenge, and every country must do its part,\" said the three agencies in a statement.\n\"Singapore seeks to work with international and regional partners to enable effective collaborations, strengthen consensus and in turn galvanise collective global climate action.\""}
