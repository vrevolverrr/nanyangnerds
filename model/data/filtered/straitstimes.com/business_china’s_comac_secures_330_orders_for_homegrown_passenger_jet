But China Eastern Airlines is the only customer that has announced a firm delivery schedule. It expects to receive its first plane in December and another four in 2023.\nThe C919 is China\u2019s rival to the popular Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX narrowbody jet families, as the country looks to become more self-sufficient amid growing tensions with the West over trade and the status of Chinese-claimed, self-governed Taiwan.\nComac said on Tuesday that China would need 9,284 new aircraft over the next 20 years to meet market demand, 200 more than in its forecast in 2021.\nThe Chinese plane maker\u2019s forecast is higher than Boeing\u2019s, which predicted in October that China would require 8,485 new planes in the next 20 years.\nBoeing forecast China would need 6,370 single-aisle planes to support its growing network of international and domestic routes in that time, while Comac said 6,896 such planes would be needed.\nBoeing has been all but shut out of orders in the world\u2019s biggest market for new aircraft since 2017 amid US-China trade tensions, though Chinese airlines have this year agreed to buy more than 300 Airbus narrowbody planes.\nComac and Boeing on Wednesday said they would expand cooperation in the Comac-Boeing Sustainable Aviation Technology Centre, which was established in 2012 to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, according to Boeing\u2019s social media account on Weibo.\nThe deal comes as Boeing remains determined to maintain a strong presence in China, even though it no longer factors the country into its financial forecasts because the country will not accept deliveries of new MAX planes.\n\u201cNot having China matters a lot to us. We want them,\u201d Boeing chief executive David Calhoun told investors last week. \u201cWe are not turning our back on them in any way, shape or form and won\u2019t.\u201d\nState-owned newspaper Global Times last month said Boeing was \u201can epitome of US companies that have experienced a backlash due to the politicisation of economic and trade issues by the US\u201d.
