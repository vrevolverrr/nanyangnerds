{"title": "Forum: Hard to see samsui woman mural as normalising smoking", "tags": "opinion", "timestamp": "2024-07-12", "content": "I am glad the authorities have agreed that no alteration has to be made to the mural of the samsui woman depicted as smoking. I also agree that the owner of the building should be fined for the unauthorised mural (Samsui woman mural can remain, but building owner will be fined $2,000 for not getting approval: URA, MOH, July 10).\nHowever, I am less than convinced by the claim by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and Ministry of Health that the mural normalises smoking.\nAfter all, the mural does not depict a person in modern garb or worse, school uniform, having a smoke but rather, a character from an era when smoking was commonplace.\nBesides, persons living in the 1900s have been portrayed to be smoking in the mass media before.\nOf direct relevance is the popular TV drama series Samsui Women, which was produced by the Singapore Broadcasting Corp (now Mediacorp), which showed various characters smoking.\nThis 24-episode series ran in 1986 and starred popular artistes. With its gripping storyline, relatability and excellent acting, the show was watched by young and old and is still available for viewing on demand via MediaCorp\u2019s MeWatch.\nCommercial breaks in episodes of Samsui Women feature short clips showing what appears to be a real-life Samsui woman smoking.\nSurely, this depiction cannot be understood to normalise smoking. The series was also produced by the national broadcaster and it ran more than a decade after Singapore started to curb smoking by enacting the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act in 1970."}
