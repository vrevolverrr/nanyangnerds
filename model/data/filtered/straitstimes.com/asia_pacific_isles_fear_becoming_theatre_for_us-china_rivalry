We want our region to be an area of collaboration.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand that what our development partners may see as areas of national security, are not necessarily what we see as national security priorities,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor us, national security priorities are economic security, they are climate security.\u201d\nMany Pacific island nations are debt-burdened, low-lying, vulnerable to rising sea levels and exposed to ever-stronger storms, droughts and floods fuelled by climate change.\nMr Brown said he would call on leaders of G-7 wealthy democracies to help combat urgent climate challenges.\n\u201cThe Pacific island countries are at the forefront of the impacts of climate change, a large proportion of it caused by the G-7 countries.\u201d\nMr Brown said a reduction in carbon emissions was a worthy long-term goal, but that there are more pressing needs.\n\u201cFor us in the Pacific, we\u2019re already facing those climate impacts now. So the focus for us is on adaptation measures and financing for adaption.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to find a way to come up with financing solutions that fit the Pacific\u2019s needs and priorities,\u201d he told AFP.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got a common enemy that we have to fight and that\u2019s climate. For every dollar we put into other areas, we\u2019re losing out on an ability to combat the impacts of climate change.\u201d\nMr Brown added that Pacific Islands leaders were disappointed that Biden cancelled a meeting with them in Papua New Guinea next week, but that it was \u201cunderstandable\u201d due to a US domestic budget dispute.
