He hopes the festivities in 2023 will draw around five to six million visitors, comparable to pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels.\nThe Christmas Eve street party will stretch from Paterson junction to Bideford junction, and it will be closed to traffic from 6pm onwards. The party will take place from 8pm to 12.30am, and will feature performances, Christmas carols, Santa Meet & Greet sessions, a market, food trucks, and a countdown to Christmas.\nMr Shaw said Orba is working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure proper crowd control and security measures for the party, which will be a one-off event in 2023.\nVisitors can also look forward to three Great Christmas Villages \u2013 up from one in 2022 \u2013 with carnival rides and games, pop-up stores, and food and beverage kiosks located outside Shaw House, Ngee Ann City and Plaza Singapura.\nThe village at Shaw House Urban Plaza will open from Nov 24 and will feature a double-storey carousel and ferris wheel, among a variety of rides and games. The remaining two \u2013 at Plaza Singapura and Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza \u2013 will open from Dec 1 and Dec 8, respectively.\nThe light-up theme aims to capture a child\u2019s imagination, with a cotton candy cloud dreamscape filled with Christmas trees and bells as well as teddy bears, reindeer and candy canes. Warm LED lights of white, yellow, pink and turquoise \u201cclouds\u201d will be floating in the air, enhancing the dreamy look and feel.\nOrganised by Orba and the Community Chest, the Light-Up Ceremony aims to raise funds to support more than 100 social service agencies running over 200 critical programmes. Hitachi Asia has been the main sponsor of the annual light-up for 33 consecutive years.\nThere will also be other attractions, such as an augmented reality (AR) projection in partnership with OUE Limited on the facade of Hilton Singapore Orchard.\nAll 25 glass panels lining the pedestrian walkway from Ion Orchard to Mandarin Gallery will also feature AR displays.\nThe outdoor visual projections will be switched on from Nov 1 to Jan 1, 2024.\nThere will be music from speakers mounted on 44 lamp posts along Orchard Road. On Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve, a countdown clock will help revellers mark the start of Christmas and the New Year.\nOrba will be doubling down on efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, such as repurposing energy-efficient LED lights and fixtures, as well as installing solar panels to power the two-set pieces located in front of Mandarin Gallery and Plaza Singapura.\nThe association will also work with the National Parks Board\u2019s Garden City Fund Plant-A-Tree Programme to plant 100 new trees along Orchard Road, and the rest of Singapore."}
