It could,\u201d Mr Sullivan said.\nHezbollah overnight said 16 of its members including senior leader Ibrahim Aqil and another top commander, Ahmed Wahbi, were among the 37 people that Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said were killed in an Israeli air strike in a Beirut suburb on Sept 20.\nThe Israeli air strike, which the Lebanese Health Ministry said killed three children and seven women, was the deadliest in its conflict with Hezbollah since Oct 8, when the group began firing rockets into Israel in sympathy with Palestinians in the nearly year-old Israeli war against Hamas in Gaza.\nMr Sullivan said the Sept 20 strike served justice to Aqil, who was wanted by the US for two 1983 Beirut truck bombings that killed more than 300 people at the American embassy and a US Marines barracks.\n\"Any time a terrorist who has murdered Americans is brought to justice, we believe that that is a good outcome.\u201d\nMr Sullivan said the risk of further escalation is \u201cacute\u201d, following the Israeli strike as well as the detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies across Lebanon in September that killed at least 39 and injured roughly 3,000.\nThose attacks were widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.\n\u201cWhile the risk of escalation is real, we actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure,\u201d Mr Sullivan said."}
