The property sector continues to weigh on the economy,\u201d said Mr Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\u201cExports improved on the margin... but exports as a pillar for growth in China are not strong enough to boost overall domestic demand,\u201d he added.\nChinese policymakers also will have to contend with underpowered overseas economies, with the World Bank on Jan 9 warning that global growth is set to slow for a third year in a row.\n\u201cNew foreign orders for Chinese producers increased significantly in December, but it is not a long-term trend,\u201d said Ms Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.
