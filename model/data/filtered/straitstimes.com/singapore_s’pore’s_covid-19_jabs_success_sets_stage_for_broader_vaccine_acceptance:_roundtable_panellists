HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that causes cervical cancer.\nBut the decision ultimately lies with the individual, Dr Leong said, quoting a Cantonese proverb about how one can lead the cow to water but cannot force it to drink.\nEpidemiologist Vincent Pang from Duke-NUS Medical School said studies have shown that people are still hesitant about getting vaccinated when there are new policies, when vaccines are being rolled out, or when new safety risks have been reported in the media.\nAdding that this may be temporary, \u201cvaccine hesitancy can potentially lead to vaccine refusal if there are no mitigation measures such as (letting people know) the benefits of having the vaccines over the risks\u201d.\nProfessor Leo Yee Sin, a public health and infectious disease specialist and senior consultant at the Ministry of Health, said building trust can mitigate vaccine hesitancy. To do this, government and healthcare personnel need to lead by example and \u201cwalk the talk\u201d.\n\u201cDuring Covid-19, when the vaccine (first) became available, 40 healthcare workers were the first group of individuals to receive the vaccine. This is the best testament that you can give to the community,\u201d she said.\nAcademics and clinicians believe in the science and understand the usefulness of the vaccine, she said. \u201cIt has become our responsibility to engage the different sectors, including the community.\u201d\nShe acknowledged that much of Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy was due to how quickly the jabs were developed, which led to suspicions that shortcuts were taken and that they were not safe.\nBut while the speed of developing the Covid-19 vaccine was unprecedented, the potential for another pandemic has accelerated the need for global health preparedness and drastically reduced the timeline to plan and react. \u201cWhat is ahead of us in terms of future development of preparedness is no longer just 50 months, we are now looking at 100 days,\u201d Prof Leo said.\nMaking the vaccine accessible to the people helped Singapore attain the lowest mortality in the world, she added.\n\u201cWe have put in good effort in terms of public health to contain the disease as early as possible, using science to guide policy decision-making, and bringing the information (directly) to the people.\u201d\nShe said that while more than 90 per cent in Singapore completed their primary jabs against Covid-19, there are \u201ca lot of other very useful vaccines\u201d that have not garnered the same level of uptake. \u201cThis is where we can use Covid-19 as a learning point to build up this kind of vaccine achievement for the entire population.\u201d\nFor instance, pneumococcal vaccines that protect against bacterial infections such as pneumonia and meningitis, and flu jabs \u201ccan protect individuals as well as protect the entire population\u201d, she said.\nDr Leong said Healthier SG, Singapore\u2019s national preventative care programme, and the family physicians involved could remind Singaporeans to get boosters \u2013 a ground-up rather than a top-down initiative.\nAlso on the panel was Pfizer\u2019s country medical director for Singapore Aditya Pathak. The session was moderated by visiting professor Tikki Pangestu of the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore."}
