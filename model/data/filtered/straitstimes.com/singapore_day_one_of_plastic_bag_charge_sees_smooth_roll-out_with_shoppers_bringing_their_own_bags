But she said plastic bags from supermarkets are always useful: \u201cEven if we are given plastic bags, we also reuse them as rubbish bags. It\u2019s not wastage.\u201d\nSome shoppers said they would reuse the plastic bags they had paid for to line their rubbish bins at home.\nMr Chan Phak Sam, 70, who bought a bag for his groceries at Northpoint City, said in Mandarin: \u201cThis five-cent charge is really a small expense when compared with other costs. Besides, I can reuse the bag for my rubbish.\u201d\nAnother shopper at the same FairPrice outlet, Madam Toh Lay Choo, purchased two plastic bags. The 63-year-old did not have reusable shopping bags with her because she had not planned to buy groceries.\nAt the self-checkout counter, she had to scan a barcode twice to include the 10 cents charge in her bill for the two bags she used.\nBut she pointed out in Mandarin: \u201cIt would be better to pay for the bags after I am done putting my groceries into the plastic bags. What if I paid for eight bags but only needed six?\u201d\nMr Chan Tee Seng, chief sustainability officer at FairPrice Group, said: \u201cWe want to also assure everybody that we are doing our part to be vigilant, to make sure that people do pay, even in the self-checkout situation.\n\u201cBut the final objective is, really, to contribute towards changing people\u2019s habits in their shopping behaviour.\u201d\nAt Giant Hypermarket at Suntec City, disposable plastic bags were not available at self-checkout counters when ST visited on Monday morning. Shoppers had to approach staff who were on standby to hand out plastic bags before scanning the barcodes to input the charges.\nMr Vinoth Ramanan, a 40-year-old IT professional, said he did not find this inconvenient: \u201cThe motive behind the bag charge is to go green, to curb plastic waste. I like that, so it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nA shopper at Sheng Siong at Hougang RiverCourt, who wanted to be known only as Ms Nur, said that at least shoppers have the option to pay for plastic bags, unlike some supermarkets she has been to in Johor Bahru where plastic bags are not even available.\nHowever, the 32-year-old said: \u201cI just think that it will be a tough change, something that we have to get used to.\u201d\nMs Sangeeta Nair, founder of Eco-Statement and a member of the Citizens\u2019 Workgroup on Reducing the Excessive Consumption of Disposables, which recommended the plastic bag charge, hopes that in the next six months to a year, \u201ca comprehensive study will be conducted to assess the impact of the bag charge on reducing single-use bag usage and examining consumer perspectives and behaviour change\u201d."}
