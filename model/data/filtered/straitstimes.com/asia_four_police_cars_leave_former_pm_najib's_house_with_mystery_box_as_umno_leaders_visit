They included Datuk Seri Mahdzir Khalid, who is the former minister of education and current MP for Padang Terap in Kedah, and Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, a former minister in the Prime Minister s Department who is MP for Pengerang in Johor.\nSeveral high-ranking Umno members for Kedah including former Kedah Mentri Besar Ahmad Bashah Md Hanipah and Datuk Seri Azeez Rahim, who is MP for Baling as well as Datuk Seri Mohd Johari Baharom, former MP for Kubang Pasu, were also seen at the home.\nNone of them spoke to reporters.\nPahang Umno Youth chief Mohd Shahar Abdullah turned up to show his support accompanied by nine supporters. Mohd Shahar told reporters that the police must be fair in their investigations. \"If they are investigating the 1MDB issue, they should stick to just that. Not go into other things,\" he said, adding that the actions taken against Najib would be judged by future generations.\nMohd Shahar, who is also Paya Besar MP, added that he was satisfied that Najib and his family were being treated well during the extended police search.\nSelangor Non-Governmental Organisations Coalition chairman Nazilah Idris was also seen paying him a visit, telling reporters later that Najib appeared calm and was in good health."}
