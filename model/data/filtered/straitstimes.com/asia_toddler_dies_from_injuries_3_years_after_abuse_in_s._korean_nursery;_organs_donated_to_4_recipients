Her organs were donated to four other infants.\nShe died from a sudden cardiac arrest after having been on a respirator for over three years. Ah-young had been in a coma after sustaining a head trauma in October 2019 at a nursery for infants in Dongrae-gu, eastern Busan.\nAh-young was a victim of serial infant abuse by a nurse in her 30s, who abused 14 babies over 15 days from Oct 5, 2019.\nShe had violently handled babies, picking them up by one leg. She dropped Ah-young five days after she was born, causing her serious head injuries.\nThe nurse was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison by the Supreme Court in May.\nAh-young was declared brain dead after her cardiac arrest on Friday. Her family has decided to donate her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys to four other children of similar age.\nIn interviews on Thursday to local media, the family said they wanted Ah-young to live on in others and for a good cause.\nThe Korea Organ Donation Agency, which matches organ donors and recipients, released a letter to Ah-young written by her parents.\n\u201cPlease be born once again as our daughter. We will make many memories together until we all become old. We will hug and say \u2018I love you\u2019 often, and sometimes argue at that time,\u201d the letter reads.\nThe transplants were carried out on Thursday at Pusan National University Hospital in Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province.
