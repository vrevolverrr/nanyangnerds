Coffee, sugar, oil palm and cocoa crops would be especially vulnerable.\nTemperatures in Thailand remained above 40 deg C in many northern and central regions over much of last week, pushing power demand to a fresh peak.\nA group of businesses and banks have asked the government to prepare an action plan to deal with a potential drought that they say might last for three years.\nRainfall in Malaysia may be as much as 40 per cent lower in some areas, which could put palm oil production at risk in one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of the commodity.\nThe authorities are closely monitoring the return of forest fires and air pollution. An El Nino event in 2015 caused a particularly bad episode of haze that was one of the worst environmental disasters in South-east Asia.\nElsewhere in Asia, scorching temperatures have roasted parts of China, India and Bangladesh over the past few weeks.\nYunnan province, a major aluminium hub in south-west China, suffered its worst drought in a decade in April.\nIndia is on alert for more heatwaves, following soaring temperatures in April that prompted school closures in some states and caused at least 11 people to die of heat stroke after attending an event.
