When the tender closed at 4pm on Wednesday, the general manager at a dealership wondered out loud: \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d\nThere were 1,039 bids in the COE category for smaller cars and less powerful EVs, compared to an average of less than 900 bids seen in the past four exercises.\nOf that number, nearly 200 bids were entered in the final five minutes before the tender closed.\nThis is the first time since October 2021 that the number of bids broke into four-digits for any type of COE.\nIt follows an announcement by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Sept 29 that an additional 300 COEs for such cars will be reallocated equally between the two tender exercises in October.\nThe LTA said it was reallocating the COEs to help \u201cmeet anticipated demand from car buyers following the September announcement of changes to the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES)\u201d.\nWith the revision, most hybrids and some of the more powerful EVs will receive $10,000 less in incentives from 2024.\nBesides the reduced incentives, VES will also be made stricter with tightened pollutant thresholds.\nAt the same time, a new testing protocol to qualify cars for sale will kick in from Jan 1, 2024, and it is expected to give a less favourable rating than existing test standards.\nSome cars that are currently in the neutral band and receive no incentives will be subjected to a penalty of $15,000 under the new regime.\nMotor dealers said this is a significant enough reason to rush to sell affected cars within 2023.\nIf there was any surge in demand for hybrid cars to get the higher VES rebates before the new year, there was little sign of it at many showrooms, which have been quiet since the last tender exercise.\nMr Nicholas Wong, general manager of Honda agent Kah Motor, attributed the high number of bids recorded to fleet vehicle owners, adding that it would be \u201cquite impossible\u201d for dealers to collect so many orders since the last tender.\nWednesday\u2019s tender is the second last exercise under the current three-month period. The LTA is expected to announce the COE supply for November to January in the coming weeks.\nMotor dealers said that even if there would be more COEs available in the coming tenders, the combined pressure of revised VES incentives and the need to meet annual sales targets means it is unlikely that premiums will come down this year.\nMs Corinne Chua, Wearnes Automotive\u2019s managing director for Volvo Cars, said that if motor dealers are anticipating a rush to get the higher incentives before the new year, the COE premium may hit \u201c$160,000 or more.\u201d"}
