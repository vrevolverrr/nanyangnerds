The war in Gaza has also increased tensions in the region.\nTurkey has opened an investigation into Eygi's killing and will request international arrest warrants, Ankara said this month, while President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would go to the ICJ over the matter.\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\nEygi's killing has added strain to ties between Israel and its main ally the United States, which has been angered by the surge of assaults on Palestinians in the West Bank and demanded a swift investigation into the incident.\nWashington has said that Eygi's killing was unacceptable and that Israel must ensure such an event never happens again.\nIsrael's initial findings on the killing do not exonerate its security forces, the United States said, warning that it would consider other measures if it is not satisfied with the results of a full Israeli probe.\nKEY QUOTES\n\"We will both bring Aysenur's reports to the United Nations Security Council's agenda, and submit our sister Aysenur's reports and evidence to the International Court of Justice, where the genocide case is continuing,\" Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters.\n\"We will also submit Aysenur's evidence to the ongoing investigation about Israeli aggressors at the International Criminal Court,\" he added, without giving a timeline.
