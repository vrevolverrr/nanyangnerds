Leaders from both countries have likewise resumed work, study and official visits.\nPeak daily traveller volume across both land checkpoints and weekly flight services between Singapore and Malaysia have been approaching pre-pandemic numbers since the Causeway reopened.\nThe King\u2019s own experience and that of his family are testament to the friendship and connection between the two countries\u2019 people extending across generations, which have been the foundation of the longstanding and multi-faceted relationship between Singapore and Malaysia, added Madam Halimah.\n\u201cI heard that Your Majesties have a special and personal connection to Singapore, particularly through the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences in the National University of Singapore (NUS),\u201d she said.\nSultan Abdullah said at the banquet that among his fond memories were \u201csecret\u201d visits to the Republic to see his now-wife, who was studying at NUS, and playing football here.\nThe King\u2019s son, Regent of Pahang Tengku Hassanal Shah, enrolled at NUS\u2019 Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in September.\nThe King and his wife are also fans of Zam Zam murtabak, located in North Bridge Road, and the local goreng pisang (banana fritters), revealed Madam Halimah. \u201cI trust that Your Majesties have had your fill of murtabak last night, but if not, Zam Zam is not too far away!\u201d she said.\nSultan Abdullah\u2019s three-day state visit caps a busy and fruitful year of high-level exchanges between Singapore and Malaysia, and reaffirms the close relationship between the two countries, said Madam Halimah.\nIn May, the Singapore Management University signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia\u2019s Universiti Teknologi Petronas to boost exchanges between staff and students, encourage collaborative research and expand internship opportunities.\nIn August, the trade ministries of both countries concluded two separate frameworks of cooperation on the digital economy and green economy.\nThese frameworks were key priorities for Singapore\u2019s chairmanship of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2022, said Madam Halimah, who thanked Malaysia for its steadfast support during the Republic\u2019s chairmanship.\nMalaysia had also contributed actively in the senior officials\u2019 meetings, and towards developing a process for other economies aspiring to join the CPTPP, she added. The CPTPP is a trade agreement between 11 Asia-Pacific countries.\n\u201cJust as your father, the late Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah, was a staunch supporter of Singapore-Malaysia ties, I am confident that Your Majesty\u2019s leadership and support will also bring Singapore and Malaysia\u2019s relationship to greater heights,\u201d she said.\nSultan Abdullah\u2019s itinerary here includes visits to Pasir Ris Camp, Newater Visitor Centre, the Asian Civilisations Museum, National Library, as well as social enterprise Edible Garden City, which focuses on growing one\u2019s own food.\nThe Malaysian royal couple also had a new orchid hybrid, Dendrobium Queen Azizah of Malaysia, named in their honour at the Istana."}
