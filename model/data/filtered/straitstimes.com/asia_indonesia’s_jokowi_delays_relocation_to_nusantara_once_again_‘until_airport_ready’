If I want to go to East Nusa Tenggara, it should be from Nusantara, and if I want to go to Aceh, it should also be from Nusantara,\u201d he explained.\nThis was not the first time the President delayed his relocation to the future capital. He was initially scheduled to start working in Nusantara in July, but the plan was postponed as key infrastructure for water supply and electricity failed to meet the July deadline.\nLater that month, however, Mr Jokowi spent his first few nights at Nusantara\u2019s presidential palace, as his administration raced to complete preparations for the country\u2019s first-ever Independence Day celebration in the future capital, which also marked its unveiling on the global stage.\nThe celebration on Aug 17 was attended by about 1,300 official guests, including Cabinet members.\nMr Jokowi led the flag-hoisting ceremony that day along with his successor, President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who has promised to continue the tradition of holding future Independence Day celebrations in Nusantara.
