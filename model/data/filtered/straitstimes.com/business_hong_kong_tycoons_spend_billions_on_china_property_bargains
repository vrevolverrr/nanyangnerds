Struggling developers such as China Evergrande Group and Shimao Group Holdings are also being forced to put treasured assets on sale to alleviate their liquidity squeeze.\nThe push underscores the relative financial strength of Hong Kong's developers and marks a reversal of earlier dynamics that saw mainland firms expand into Hong Kong. Little more than a year ago, Kaisa Group Holdings was seen as an up-and-coming player in the city's property market. By December the Chinese property developer was a desperate seller and in default.\n\"Hong Kong developers are seizing a downturn in China's property market, but are also cautious in picking the high-quality projects with long-term potential,\" said Morningstar Investment Service senior equity analyst Michael Wu.\nNew World Development is betting big on the Greater Bay Area comprising Hong Kong and Guangdong province. China's implementation of the so-called three red lines - metrics introduced to curb borrowing among its developers - has presented an opportunity, chief executive Adrian Cheng said.\n\"New World can acquire very cheap land and land with high margins in a crisis,\" the property heir, whose billionaire family runs the company, said in a post-earnings call late last month. \"This is what we call a quick win.\"\nOthers are mulling acquisitions too. Swire Properties plans to set aside HK$50 billion (S$8.7 billion) to invest in mainland China over the next decade.\nHang Lung Properties' vice-chair Adriel Chan said in January that \"the sky is the limit\" for the firm's scale of potential acquisitions in mainland China.\nThere are more opportunities in the Chinese market for lowly geared companies like Hang Lung, said Mr Chan, who is the grandson of the company's founder.\nRamping up mainland investments gives Hong Kong developers another avenue of growth as their own market gets saturated and the authorities pay greater attention to affordability, allocating more land to build public housing.\nIn China, the retreat of cash-strapped developers from government auctions, a traditional way for builders to acquire new plots, is suppressing land values. Average prices last month declined to the lowest since 2019, at 1,905 yuan (S$406) per sq m, according to China Real Estate Information, a local research provider.\nSome Chinese cities are now effectively selling land to themselves to raise money.\nMr Philip Tse, director and head of Hong Kong and China property research at Bocom International Holdings, said that Hong Kong players are likely to be interested in commercial property projects in first- and second-tier Chinese cities, where their branding and management make them stand out.\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence real estate analyst Patrick Wong, that is in contrast with residential property development, which has not always gone to plan for the city's developers.\n\"China's competition in property sales is very strong, and there's also policy risk - regulations suddenly get tightened then loosened,\" Mr Wong said. \"If they happen to face a downturn in the market when their projects finish, the sales get stalled, so it's quite challenging.\""}
