It accuses Hamas of using Palestinian civilians as human shields, which Hamas denies.\nNearly 300 humanitarian aid workers, more than two-thirds of them UN staff, have also been killed amid the conflict, according to the UN.\nMr Guterres said there should be an effective investigation and accountability for their deaths.\n\u201cWe have courts, but we see that the decisions of courts are not respected, and it is this kind of limbo of accountability that is totally unacceptable and that requires also a serious reflection,\u201d he said.\nThe top UN court, the International Court of Justice, said in July that Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements is illegal and should be withdrawn.\nThe 193-member UN General Assembly is likely to vote next week on a draft resolution that would give Israel a six-month deadline to do so.\nMr Guterres said he has not spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who has long accused the UN of being anti-Israel \u2013 since the Oct 7 Hamas attack.\nThe pair met in person at the UN a year ago, and Mr Guterres said he would do so again \u2013 if Mr Netanyahu asked.\n\u201cI have not talked to him because he didn\u2019t pick up my phone calls, but I have no reason not to speak with him,\u201d Mr Guterres said. \u201cSo if he comes to New York, and he asks to see me, I will be very glad to see him.\u201d\nWhen asked if Mr Netanyahu planned to meet Mr Guterres on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Israel\u2019s UN Ambassador Danny Danon said Mr Netanyahu\u2019s schedule has not been finalised yet.\nHaiti \u2018scandal\u2019\nMr Guterres described the current state of the world as chaotic.\nHe said the Gaza conflict and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine were stuck, with no peaceful solutions in sight.\nWhen asked about Western accusations that North Korea and Iran are now providing Russia with weapons, Mr Guterres said: \u201cAny expansion of war in Ukraine is an absolutely dramatic development.\u201d\nIran has rejected the Western accusations, while North Korea has denied the allegations against it.\nUN sanctions monitors said in April that debris from a missile that landed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Jan 2 was from a North Korean Hwasong-11 series ballistic missile.\nIn Haiti, a UN-backed international force has been slow to deploy \u2013 after Haiti asked for help in 2022 \u2013 and lacks funds.\nThe United States wants the UN Security Council to ask the global body for a plan to transition the force into a UN peacekeeping operation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think peacekeeping is the best solution in a situation like this... peacekeeping means to keep the peace, and that\u2019s not exactly the situation we have in Haiti,\u201d Mr Guterres said. \u201cI find it a scandal that it has been so difficult to mobilise funds for such a dramatic situation.\u201d\nTrump looms\nMr Guterres\u2019 first five-year term as secretary-general coincided with the US presidency of Donald Trump, who cut funding to the international body, calling it weak and incompetent.\nTrump is again the Republican presidential nominee and will face off against Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris in the Nov 5 election.\n\u201cWe are ready to work in all circumstances in defence of the values of the (founding UN) charter and of the values of the UN,\u201d Mr Guterres said when asked if the world body had a contingency plan for a possible second Trump administration.\nDuring his first term in office, Trump also withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement, an international pact to fight climate change, and Trump\u2019s campaign said he would do it again if he wins in November.\nThe US is currently a full participant in the accord, after President Joe Biden swiftly rejoined in 2021.\n\u201cIt will survive. But, of course, it will probably survive severely undermined,\u201d Mr Guterres said of a second withdrawal from the pact by a potential Trump administration.\nMr Guterres has long pushed for stronger action to fight climate change.\nWith abortion rights a key topic in the US election, Mr Guterres said the US voice was \u201cobviously very important\u201d at the UN when it came to the issue of women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights, as well as health.\nUnder Trump\u2019s presidency, the US opposed long-agreed international language on women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights and health in UN resolutions over concern that it would advance abortion rights.\nTrump also cut funding in 2017 for the UN Population Fund because, as his administration said, it \u201csupports, or participates in the management of, a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation\u201d.\nThe UN said this was an inaccurate perception.
