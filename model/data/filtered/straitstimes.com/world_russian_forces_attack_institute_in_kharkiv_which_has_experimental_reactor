It has caused thousands of deaths and forced more than 2 million people to flee Ukraine, where several cities are under siege.\nIt has also hit the world's economy, still emerging from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nInternational Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the war and the massive sanctions leveraged against Russia as punishment have triggered a contraction in global trade and sent food and energy prices sharply higher, which will force the IMF to lower its global growth forecast next month.\nA ceasefire was not meant to be on the agenda at Thursday's talks in Antalya, Mr Lavrov added.\nWhile there was no apparent progress towards a ceasefire, analysts said the fact the ministers were even meeting left a window open for ending the war.\nThe road ahead for any negotiation would be difficult, but Moscow's slower-than-expected military progress and the stinging cost of sanctions had potentially opened an opportunity for a compromise, they said.\nIn Washington, Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns said Mr Putin did not appear to have a \"sustainable\" end-game in Ukraine and might soon try to find a way to end the fighting.\nOthers, however, cautioned that Putin could still seek to escalate.\n\"We have moved the dial for the process from zero to at least having the possibility for a discussion. But the indications of troop movements toward Kyiv may indicate that the worst may still be ahead of us,\" said Jonathan Eyal at the Royal United Services Institute in London."}
