Findings from this three-year study, led by NUS researchers, will guide the planning and design of future senior housing types.\nThe study will take into account the diverse needs, evolving preferences and changing aspirations of future seniors who may be living alone or with their families, said Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann on June 4.\nSpeaking at the World Cities Summit held at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre, Ms Sim noted that the authorities have introduced several new housing types for seniors in recent years.\nThese include community care apartments, which pair senior-friendly housing design with on-site care services, and the Kampung Admiralty project in Woodlands, the first Housing Board project to co-locate childcare and senior centres in one integrated development. These developments are part of the study.\n\u201cAs we continue to explore new ways to support our seniors, we will need continued research to inform our decisions,\u201d she said.\nThe Ministry of National Development said the project, which comes under the Cities of Tomorrow programme, will develop a framework to provide a baseline measurement and comparison of seniors\u2019 quality of living across the different housing types.\nIt will also analyse the strengths and weaknesses of each housing type, and establish \u201cminimum\u201d standards.\nThe Cities of Tomorrow programme aims to address challenges that impact Singapore\u2019s ability to have a liveable, inclusive and green living environment.\nIn a panel discussion at the summit on June 4, panellists \u2013 who included representatives from Vienna and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), as well as HDB, URA and Woha Architects \u2013 were asked about the challenges cities will face in rejuvenating.\nMr Ernst Woller, president of Vienna\u2019s Provincial Parliament, said that as Vienna is a more than 2,000-year-old historical city, there are restrictions in developing certain areas with heritage sites. Therefore, the capital of Austria has to be \u201cvery careful\u201d with its land use.\nHe added that a quarter of its population, or 500,000 people, live in 220,000 subsidised rental flats owned by the city.\n\u201cIf we sell them, it would reduce the number of flats in our city, and we need them for the next generations,\u201d he said, adding that rent is controlled and tenants are protected by strong tenancy laws.\nMr Rafael Tuts, director of the UN-Habitat Global Solutions Division, said a downside of urban development is that it can lead to gentrification and the displacement of existing residents and businesses, especially in low-income areas.\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s very important to manage the social impacts and ensure affordable housing,\u201d he said.\nMr Lee Wai Kin, URA\u2019s group director of the Strategic Planning Group, said that building trust is a challenge that cities must overcome for long-term and large-scale rejuvenation.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re selling is a long-term vision, but what the community and stakeholders are experiencing on a day-to-day basis throughout the very long process (of rejuvenation) are inconveniences and disruptions, which they must live through before enjoying the benefits,\u201d he added.\nThe moderator, Mr Fong Chun Wah, adviser to HDB, also asked how rejuvenation would look in Singapore.\nMr Choo Chin Hua, HDB\u2019s group director of design development, said the oldest HDB blocks are around 50 to 60 years old, and most of them have gone through an upgrading initiative.\nNoting that all HDB flats will be upgraded twice over their lifespan, he added: \u201cOne major challenge is to come up with a better way of upgrading them, and how to do this on an extensive scale in the years to come.\u201d\nURA\u2019s Mr Lee said it is important to preserve heritage and nature, so the authority will redevelop brownfield sites and \u201ctry to delay or slow down the need to open up greenfield sites\u201d.\nBrownfield sites are land plots with previous developments on them, while greenfield sites are places that have not been previously built on.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t promise that we will leave a piece of land untouched in Singapore, but as far as possible, we try to make sure that we recycle our existing brownfield sites first and make good use of (them),\u201d he said."}
