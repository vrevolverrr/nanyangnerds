Xia Haijun, a former chief executive, was fined US$2 million and also banned from financial markets, along with several other executives. The company\u2019s main onshore unit, Hengda, was fined US$580 million.\nThe New York Times reported in December 2023 that questionable accounting and poor oversight led to Evergrande\u2019s demise. Over the years before it defaulted on its debt, Evergrande had been treating money it received for apartments as revenue even though, at times, it had not built those apartments, the Times reported.\nIn the company filing, Hengda laid the blame solely on Hui. As chairman of Evergrande, Hui was in charge of all of the company\u2019s real estate business and \u201cinstructed other personnel to falsely increase the performance\u201d, the company wrote. He did so, it added, \u201cwith exceptionally bad means and exceptionally serious circumstances\u201d.\nRegulators found that Hengda inflated its revenue by nearly US$30 billion in 2019 and by US$48.6 billion in 2020. Then it raised money in financial markets based on the falsified numbers.\nThe development is yet another blow to Evergrande\u2019s already shattered reputation. Once an emblem of China\u2019s entrepreneurial success and ambition, Evergrande is now a name that angers home owners across China.\nIt has become the most visible example of China\u2019s real estate crisis. Its failure, under US$300 billion of debt, heralded the largest wave of property defaults in modern history. China\u2019s top leaders are now trying to wean the US$18 trillion economy off construction, a sector that once contributed to a third of the country\u2019s growth and employed many of its workers.\nAfter it defaulted, Evergrande tried to work with private lenders and international investors who had lent it tens of billions of dollars overseas. In the summer of 2023, the company reported that it had made progress towards a restructuring deal. Then, in September, Hui was detained by the authorities and all restructuring talks came to an end."}
