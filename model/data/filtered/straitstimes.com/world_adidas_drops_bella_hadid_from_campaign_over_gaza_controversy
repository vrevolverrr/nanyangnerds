Eleven Israeli athletes and a German police officer were killed at the 1972 Munich Games after gunmen from the Palestinian Black September group broke into the Olympic village and took them hostage.\nMs Hadid, who was born in the US but has Palestinian roots through her father, has been vocal about her support for Palestinian rights since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct 7 triggered the war in Gaza.\nAdidas said it would be \u201crevising the remainder of the campaign\u201d with immediate effect.\n\u201cWe are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events \u2013 though these are completely unintentional \u2013 and we apologise for any upset or distress caused,\u201d the company said in a statement sent to AFP on July 19.\n\u2018Collective memory\u2019\nA spokeswoman confirmed that Ms Hadid had been removed from the campaign, which notes that the shoes were first introduced in 1972 but never mentions the terror attack on the Israeli athletes.\nPictures of the American model wearing the retro Adidas shoes had caused an outcry among pro-Israeli groups.\n\u201cGuess who the face of the campaign is? Bella Hadid, a model with Palestinian roots who has spread anti-Semitism in the past and incited violence against Israelis and Jews,\u201d the Israeli embassy in Germany wrote on X on July 18.\n\u201cHow can Adidas now claim that the reference (to the events in Munich) was \u2018completely unintentional\u2019?\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to Germany Ron Prosor said in response to the firm\u2019s climbdown. \u201cThe terror of 1972 is etched into the collective memory of Germans and Israelis,\u201d he told Die Welt TV on July 19.\nA flood of social media posts meanwhile expressed support for Ms Hadid, criticised Adidas for axing the model, and called for a boycott of the company.\nPro-Palestinian demonstrations\nThe Gaza war was triggered by the Oct 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel\u2019s military retaliation to wipe out Hamas has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.\nMs Hadid has taken part in several pro-Palestinian demonstrations during the conflict and has described Israel\u2019s offensive as a genocide."}
