Another failed flight would have seen Japan face the prospect of losing independent access to space.\nThe H3\u2018s first flight in March 2023 ended with ground control destroying the rocket 14 minutes after lift-off because its second-stage engine failed to ignite. Jaxa listed three possible electrical faults in a review released in October 2023, but could not identify the direct cause.\nFive months earlier, Jaxa\u2019s small rocket Epsilon had also failed to launch.\n\u201cSo happy to see this incredible accomplishment in the space sector that follows on from the success of the Slim Moon landing,\u201d Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in a post on X.\nThe 63m H3 is designed to carry a 6.5-tonne payload into space. Over the long term, the agency wants to reduce per-launch cost to as low as five billion yen (S$45 million) \u2013 half of what an H-IIA launch costs \u2013 by adopting simpler structures and automotive-grade electronics.\nJaxa and primary contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries hope these features will help them win launch orders from global clients.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken some time for the programme to get to this point, but with this launch they will be fielding enquiries from around the world,\u201d said Professor Ko Ogasawara of the Tokyo University of Science.\nThe Japanese government plans to launch about 20 satellites and probes with H3 rockets by 2030. The H3 is scheduled to deliver a lunar explorer for the joint Japan-India Lupex project in 2025 as well as cargo spacecraft for the US-led Artemis Moon exploration programme in the future.\nSatellite launch demands have skyrocketed thanks to the rise of affordable commercial vehicles such as SpaceX\u2019s reusable Falcon 9, and a number of new rockets are being tested in 2024.\nJanuary 2024 marked the successful inaugural flight of the United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan rocket, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The European Space Agency also plans to launch its lower-cost Ariane 6 for the first time in 2024.\nHead of Mitsubishi Heavy\u2019s defence and space business Masayuki Eguchi said the company has a long-term target of launching eight to 10 rockets a year, which would boost its 50 billion yen space business sales by 20 per cent to 30 per cent.\nThat would require additional production capacity, he added, noting that the company\u2019s factories can produce only five to six H3 rockets a year now.
