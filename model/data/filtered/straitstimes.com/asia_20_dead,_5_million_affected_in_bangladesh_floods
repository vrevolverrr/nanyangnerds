Barely anyone has come with the relief (aid) deep inside the villages. You have to physically go close to the main road to collect it,\u201d he told Reuters TV.\nSome people in Bangladesh have alleged that the floods were caused by the opening of dam sluice gates in neighbouring India, an assertion New Delhi has rejected.\nMr Yunus said: \u201cWe have begun discussions with neighbouring countries to prevent future flood situations.\u201d\nThe Bangladesh Meteorological Department has warned that flood conditions could persist if the monsoon rains continue, as water levels were receding very slowly.\nMore than 400,000 people have taken refuge in around 3,500 shelters in the 11 flood-hit districts, where nearly 750 medical teams are on the ground to provide treatment, with the army, air force, navy and Border Guard Bangladesh assisting in rescue operations, the authorities said.\nAn analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world\u2019s most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.\n\u201cThe impact of this year\u2019s monsoon rains has been widespread and devastating,\u201d said Ms Kabita Bose, country director of Plan International Bangladesh.\n\u201cEntire communities have been completely inundated, and there are now millions of people, including children, in need of safe shelter and life-saving humanitarian assistance,\u201d she added.
