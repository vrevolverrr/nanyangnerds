That\u2019s where they failed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible they\u2019re overextended dealing with the war in Ukraine and dealing with political opposition. This one slipped through the cracks.\u201d\nThe FSB has said March 22\u2019s concert hall attack was \u201cpainstakingly\u201d planned and that the gunmen had carefully hidden their weapons.\nMr Putin on March 25 said radical Islamists were the ones who had carried out the attack, but added that Russia still wanted to understand who had ordered it and that there were many questions for Ukraine to answer.\nUkraine denies any involvement.\nWhen asked on March 25 if the assault represented an intelligence service failure, the Kremlin said Russia\u2019s stand-off with the West meant intelligence-sharing was not happening in the way it used to.\n\u201cUnfortunately, our world shows that no city, no country can be completely immune from the threat of terrorism,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Russia\u2019s intelligence services worked tirelessly to defend the country, he added.\nStill, the shooting on March 22, in which at least 139 people were killed and 180 injured, has undermined one of Mr Putin\u2019s longstanding pledges to the Russian people: to ensure stability and security.\nIt has also shaken some residents of the Russian capital, who have largely been insulated from the violence of the Ukraine war despite occasional drone strikes.\nWhether the men were tasked by ISIS, as the militant group and the West assert, or whether there may have been some kind of Ukrainian connection as Mr Putin has hinted \u2013 and Kyiv has flatly denied \u2013 there were warning signs which do not appear to have been heeded.\nSecurity analysts said the manner in which the attack and escape was carried out was evidence of extensive reconnaissance of the venue beforehand and Russian media published closed-circuit television footage of one of the gunmen visiting at an earlier date.\nOn March 7, the US Embassy in Moscow issued a security alert to Americans, telling them it was \u201cmonitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts\u201d.\nOn March 19, three days before the killing spree, Mr Putin delivered a speech to FSB chiefs in which he dismissed what he said were \u201cprovocative\u201d Western warnings about a terrorist act.\n\u201cAll these actions resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilise our society,\u201d said Mr Putin.\nProfessor of international affairs Nina Khrushcheva of The New School in New York said the FSB appeared to have had ISIS, also known as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, on its radar. But she said Mr Putin\u2019s view that Russia was locked in an existential struggle with a US-led West would have made it difficult for Moscow to take at face value a security warning from the US.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mistrust. It\u2019s not like America isn\u2019t involved in misinformation,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn Putin\u2019s world, where it is an existential battle between Russia and the West that wants to undermine Russia and demolish it, of course he wouldn\u2019t believe it because how does he know from his own KGB background that America is not creating its own false flag (operation)?\u201d\nA false flag operation is an act committed with the intent of disguising the source of responsibility and pin blame on another party.\nMr John Sipher, who served a stint in Russia during his career in the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Service, said he believed the FSB may have dropped the ball because it was too busy focusing on political and other threats to Mr Putin and his government.\n\u201cThe (security services) are more about protecting the Kremlin than they are about protecting the people,\u201d said Mr Sipher, who predicted that Mr Putin would now use the attack to justify some new action against the West and Ukraine.\nAnother warning came on March 2 in southern Russia when FSB special forces killed six gunmen whom they identified as members of ISIS.\nThree of the men were on a federal wanted list, and the militants had killed three policemen the previous year. The FSB found a weapons stash.\nOn March 7, the FSB said it had prevented an attack on a synagogue in Moscow that had been plotted by an ISIS cell and that the attackers had been killed in a shoot-out.\nMr Riccardo Valle, a researcher on militant movements, said the March 2 incident should have sent warning signals.\n\u201cI think the fact the security forces discovered that there is a network of (ISIS) in Russia, and a strong one capable of acquiring weapons and putting up strong resistance against special forces \u2013 this should have raised the alarm in Moscow security agencies,\u201d Mr Valle said in a phone interview.\n\u201cMaybe it did but they were not able to prevent the attack in time,\u201d said the director of research at The Khorasan Diary, a research and news platform based in Islamabad.\nHe said it was also clear from previous statements and attacks by ISIS-K, including on Russia\u2019s embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul in 2022, that the group had Russia in its sights.
