IDC has said only about 3 per cent of PCs shipped in 2024 will be AI-optimised.\nDell Technologies\u2019 shipments decreased 2.4 per cent in the quarter, making it the only major company to see a decline, while Lenovo Group commanded the highest market share at almost 23 per cent.\nHP saw an increase of 1.8 per cent from a year earlier and was the second-biggest PC maker with 21 per cent of the market.\nWeak demand in China held the overall results back \u2013 excluding that country, worldwide shipments grew more than 5 per cent, IDC said.
