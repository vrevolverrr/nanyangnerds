Eight officers were deployed and when they reached the hotel, they saw the tapir on the fifth floor of the building.\nThe tapir was then sedated by game rangers from the Wildlife and National Parks Department before it was handed over to the Animal Welfare Department.\nThe Malayan tapir, also called the Asian tapir, is a species native to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, Indonesia.\nIt has been classified as an endangered animal on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List since 2008, with a total population of fewer than 2,500 mature individuals.\nThe last sighting of a tapir in Singapore was on Pulau Ubin in 1986.
