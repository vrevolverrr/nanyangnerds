{"title": "Germany\u2019s lost year is over but 2024 may not be much better", "tags": "business", "timestamp": "2024-01-07", "content": "Even if Germany\u2019s economy finally begins expanding again in 2024, it will struggle to shake off the funk behind one of its weakest annual performances in a generation.\nBeset by energy woes and creaking infrastructure, hit by a downturn in global demand and lagging in the race for electric-vehicle dominance, the country was probably in recession as it ended 2023 with a shock court decision that undermined Berlin\u2019s whole strategy for budget financing.\nWith industrial data next week likely to show little improvement from a three-year low, the government straitjacketed over ramping up investment, and the threat of train strikes looming, few economists anticipate much of a pickup. A nation long seen as the motor of the euro zone is fumbling for the ignition.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty pessimistic for German growth this year,\u201d said Mr Stefan Schneider, chief economist for Germany at Deutsche Bank Research. \u201cA combination of cyclical and structural pressures are currently crushing the hope that the country can untangle its knot and return to its previous growth rates of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in the foreseeable future.\u201d\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner acknowledged the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d trope in body and speech when he appeared at a Free Democrats member event at Stuttgart\u2019s opera house on Jan 6.\nSpeaking with \u201ca bit of a fever\u201d, Mr Lindner acknowledged the downbeat headlines about the German economy and the country\u2019s uphill battle. \u201cWe have too little economic growth,\u201d he said, while insisting that the economy \u201chas enormous turnaround potential\u201d.\nWhile surveys have pointed to a possible bottoming out in the country\u2019s manufacturing malaise, reports in the coming days may also underscore just how far it has fallen.\nFactory orders in October were close to the lowest level since mid-2020, and economists anticipated data on Jan 8 to reveal an increase of 1 per cent in November, nowhere near enough to repair the damage. Exports were released the same day.\nOn Jan 9, data on industrial production \u2013 also languishing at a similarly low level \u2013 will show if it too finally began recovering after five successive months of declines.\nThe overall impression may point to a second quarter of contraction, conventionally described as a recession. A fuller indication will be available on Jan 15, when German officials reveal the Group of Seven\u2019s first national estimate for 2023 full-year gross domestic product.\nThat will probably feature a small annual decline, predicted by the Bundesbank at 0.1 per cent, while the European Commission has projected a 0.3 per cent drop.\nThe only times in the past two decades that Germany fared worse were in 2009 \u2013 as the global financial crisis raged \u2013 and then during the pandemic shock of 2020.\nThe country limped into 2023 just avoiding a widely predicted recession, but beset by a crisis over its gas supply after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that has yet to be sustainably resolved.\nWhile the answer of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition was to double down on the transition to climate-friendly energy, its method of doing that \u2013 off-balance sheet special funding vehicles \u2013 has just been effectively slapped down by Germany\u2019s top court.\nMinisters have since cobbled together redrafted budgets for both 2023 and 2024, but the bigger question of how to retool the economy to make up for years of under-investment remains unresolved as the government struggles with a constitutionally enshrined borrowing limit that calls for near-balanced budgets.\n\u201cThe transition to a climate-neutral country and the great deal of investment that must be made before income can be generated at some point are also adding to uncertainty,\u201d said Dr Gabriele Widmann, an economist at Dekabank. \u201cThis is something that will be a burden this year and in the coming years.\u201d\nChancellor Scholz\u2019s political challenge is compounded by the potential of more and longer train strikes, farmers angry at the removal of subsidies, and the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which is likely to make gains in regional elections later in 2024 in its strongholds in the country\u2019s east.\nGermany\u2019s economic woes are not just energy-related, as staff shortages heap pressure on its manufacturing-based business model. And at a time when China\u2019s BYD has surpassed even Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of electric vehicles, the country\u2019s VDA auto lobby said on Jan 4 that production of passenger cars in 2023 was still 12 per cent below the level of 2019.\nGiven that backdrop, the Bundesbank anticipates overall growth of just 0.4 per cent in 2024. That would be an improvement on 2023, but still one of its poorest outcomes this century, in tandem with inflation that officials reckon will linger for longer than in other major euro zone economies.\nMr Lindner on Jan 6 rejected calls for growth-seeking subsidies modelled on those offered by the Inflation Reduction Act in the US, saying that Germany\u2019s strength and foundation for prosperity rested with its small businesses, start-ups and industry and their ability to innovate.\nMr Schneider of Deutsche Bank says another annual contraction of 0.2 per cent could be on the cards, though even he sees the prospect of a pickup in due course.\n\u201cThe hope is that from the spring, as households\u2019 real incomes in particular rise, inflation continues to fall and households\u2019 optimism perhaps also rises a little, we will be able to get out of this tailspin,\u201d he said. \u201cPrivate consumption is likely to save us from a significant economic downturn.\u201d\nOne economist who is more optimistic is Mr Stefan Muetze at Helaba, who reckons that the combination of a pickup in consumer spending, industrial demand and investment in the green transition could drive growth exceeding 1 per cent.\n\u201cOur thesis is that things will get better in 2024, also in industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe assume that exports will recover somewhat over the course of the year.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
