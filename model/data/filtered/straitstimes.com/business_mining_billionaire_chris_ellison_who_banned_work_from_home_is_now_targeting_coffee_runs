Stepping outside for a coffee could well be the next endangered perk.\n\u201cI want to hold them captive all day long,\u201d Mr Ellison, chief executive of Mineral Resources, said on Aug 29.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them leaving the building. So I don\u2019t want them walking down the road for a cup of coffee. We kind of figured out a few years ago how much that costs.\u201d\nMr Ellison was championing the perks of working at the firm\u2019s two-year-old Perth headquarters, which boasts a cafe, restaurant, gym, creche, reflection room and wellness centre. The 67-year-old mining veteran said staff \u201cloved working\u201d in the building and its facilities \u201ckept them glued\u201d there.\n\u201cI have a no-work-from-home policy,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of a call with analysts following an earnings update. \u201cI wish everyone else would get on board with that, the sooner the better.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe can\u2019t have people working three days a week and picking up five days a week pay.\u201d\nMr Ellison\u2019s office policy is something of an outlier in Australia, where working from home has become the norm for white-collar workers. Many companies allow their employees to work remotely at least two days a week, with many parents embracing their new-found flexibility.\nFor those juggling busy work schedules and children, Mr Ellison said the firm\u2019s daycare centre would charge just A$20 (S$17.70) a day, compared with external costs of about A$180 a day.\n\u201cDrop the little tykes off next door,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to feed them, but mum and dad will be working in our office.\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
