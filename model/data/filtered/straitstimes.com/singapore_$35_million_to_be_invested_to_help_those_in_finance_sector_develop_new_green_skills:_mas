This builds on a base of more than 100 such courses available currently.\nThe Singapore Green Finance Centre has launched three online courses on sustainability stewardship, carbon markets and sustainable investment management targeted at mid-career professionals looking to pivot into the space.\nA fourth online course, which is an introduction to sustainability and sustainable finance with a focus on Asia, will be made available to the public for free in a bid to raise awareness among them.\nTwo new undergraduate programmes on sustainable finance will also be developed by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and NUS.\nNTU\u2019s bachelor of accounting in sustainable management will be available for enrolment from August 2024.\nMs Nikki Kemp, executive director of the Singapore Green Finance Centre, is hoping to collaborate across different universities here to offer a wider variety of training courses, particularly in nature-based solutions and climate science, as these are emerging areas of focus in the finance sector.\nShe also hopes for more resources to be poured into developing the academic capacity locally to support more such courses in future.\nMeanwhile, the Asia Centre of Carbon Excellence was launched on April 17 to help bring together a group of international experts focused on innovative and novel carbon project development, carbon policy and capacity-building.\nLaunched jointly by climate consultancy South Pole and Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero, the core focus of the centre is to unlock new approaches to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.\nFor instance, in the near term, the centre will look at using carbon credits to scale up and commercialise the use of green hydrogen, which is thought to be a clean fuel as it does not produce any planet-warming emissions when burned.\nThe centre will also help support governments and businesses on using carbon markets to meet their national climate targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement."}
