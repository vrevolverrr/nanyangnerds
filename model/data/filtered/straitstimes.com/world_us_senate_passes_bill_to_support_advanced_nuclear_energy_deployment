It passed the Senate 88-2 votes.\n\u201cIn a major victory for our climate and American energy security, the US Senate has passed the Advance Act with overwhelming, bipartisan support,\u201d said Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat, who is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\u201cToday, we sent the Advance Act to the President\u2019s desk because Congress worked together to recognise the importance of nuclear energy to America\u2019s future and got the job done,\u201d said Republican Shelley Moore Capito, a ranking member of the committee.\nAmong other things, the Bill will cut regulatory costs for companies seeking to license advanced nuclear reactor technologies, create a prize for the successful deployment of next-generation reactors, and speed licencing for nuclear facilities at certain sites.\nThe Bill could benefit companies like Bill Gates-backed TerraPower, which is trying to build a US$4 billion (S$5.4 billion) Natrium reactor in Wyoming on the site of an old coal plant but is struggling to secure a key permit.\nNon-proliferation groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists have warned against measures that ease licensing for high-tech nuclear reactors, including those using highly enriched uranium, arguing that safety should remain the priority.\nThe US nuclear industry has struggled to expand in recent decades due to soaring costs and complex permitting requirements, and as advanced nuclear technologies prove difficult to fund and develop.
