Therefore, we are taking steps to increase our healthcare capacity.\n\"Over last few days, we have been sending patients to some private hospitals. Today, we have operationalised a community isolation facility.\"\nCurrently, patients who are well enough to be discharged from medical care but still test positive for the Covid-19 virus have been isolated in hospitals. MOH said that this was not an efficient use of hospital resources as the patients do not require significant medical care."}
