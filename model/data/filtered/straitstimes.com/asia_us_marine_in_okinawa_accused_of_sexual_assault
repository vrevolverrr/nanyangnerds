After the incident, the woman visited a hospital and an official there reported the case to the prefectural police.\nIn July, the Japanese government launched steps to swiftly share information on US military-related incidents with local governments, after criticism mounted that information had not been relayed to the Okinawa prefectural government over sexual assault cases involving US military personnel.\nIn the latest case, the prefectural police notified the prefectural government on the day the papers were sent to the prosecutors.\nIn June, a Japanese government spokesman told reporters that a 25-year-old American soldier had been charged in March over the alleged sexual assault of a minor, adding that he had known the girl was under 16, the age of consent in Japan.\nA month after the news, US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel and Lieutenant-General Roger Turner, the Okinawa area coordinator and head of US forces in the prefecture, announced the reinforcing of relevant measures to prevent a recurrence of sexual assault incidents.\nOkinawa accounts for just 0.6 per cent of Japan\u2019s land mass but hosts about 70 per cent of all US military bases and facilities in the country.\nA litany of base-related woes has long grieved Okinawans, from pollution to noise and helicopter crashes, leading to complaints that they bear the brunt of hosting troops.\nThe 1995 gang rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US soldiers in Okinawa prompted widespread calls for a rethinking of a 1960 pact that outlined the legal status of Japan-based US military personnel.
