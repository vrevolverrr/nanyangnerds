I think it\u2019s a small, small minority.\n\u201cI would say it is wrong to sell. It is with great appreciation and respect that we selected the names and confirmed the medals for these deserving people,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes recipients would \u201crespect and cherish the medals\u201d."}
