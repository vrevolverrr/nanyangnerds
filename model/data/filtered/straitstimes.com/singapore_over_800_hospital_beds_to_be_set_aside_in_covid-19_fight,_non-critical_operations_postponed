These include activating doctors and nurses in inpatient units to redeploy them to emergency departments, as well as preparing more beds and holding spaces to cope with any increase in cases.\nAt present, the bed occupancy of hospitals stands at about 93 per cent, with 200 additional beds already activated.\nAs at Friday, there were nine cases in the intensive care units of hospitals, with more than 50 made available purely for Covid-19 cases, which is adequate, Associate Professor Mak noted.\nA total of 670 acute isolation beds have been set aside for Covid-19 cases, with current bed occupancy at just under 8 per cent, with another 100 beds to be made available across three public hospitals next week.\nAlthough non-critical operations will be placed on the back burner, he stressed that doctors will triage patients accordingly and prioritise those with medical conditions that would deteriorate if immediate treatment is not rendered.\nCoupled with the availability of oral antiviral medication, this would help patients recover while reducing the need for admission to hospitals.\nProf Mak said MOH will continue to monitor demand for beds in community treatment facilities and transitional care facilities, and make more available if required.\nThis announcement comes after the introduction of stricter measures in hospitals and residential care homes on Friday.\nThe tighter curbs on visitors to these places will continue until Nov 10. MOH said the measure are meant to protect healthcare capacity and the vulnerable during this period of rising cases\nIn the hospitals, patients will be allowed two pre-designated visitors, and only one can be at the bedside at any one time.\nCritically ill patients will be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, of whom two can be at the bedside at any one time.\nEach visit will be limited to 30 minutes, although this can be extended at the discretion of the hospital in the case of exceptional situations, such as for critically ill or paediatric patients.\nThose in residential care homes may have up to four pre-designated visitors, and only one may be allowed at any one time for up to 30 minutes.\nVisitors are encouraged to take an antigen rapid test on the day of their visits."}
