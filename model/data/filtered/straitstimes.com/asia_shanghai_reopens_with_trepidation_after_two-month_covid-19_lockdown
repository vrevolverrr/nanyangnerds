Celebrations have been tempered by fears of a resurgence in cases and another lockdown.\nThe city's 25 million residents will now be able to drive their cars and take public transport, but will need to have a nucleic acid test done within the past 72 hours. Testing booths have been set up within striking distance of every estate - a sign that China's harsh \"zero-Covid\" policy is here to stay.\nPublic transport like trains, taxis and buses have resumed across the city, as have high-speed rail services and flights - days before, social media images had shown scores of people camped out at the airport and railway stations hoping to leave the city.\nAt the stroke of midnight, barriers were lifted across much of Shanghai, allowing residents to exit residential compounds, while police reopened previously blocked roads allowing drivers to move between districts - previously barred under lockdown rules.\nSocial media videos showed some residents celebrating with sparklers while others were seen popping champagne.\nCurbs have been lifted for about 22.5 million who live in \"low-risk areas\". Residents must still wear masks in public and avoid mass gatherings; shops can operate at 75 per cent capacity; while gyms will open at a later date.\nSixteen-year-old student Daphne, who asked to be identified only by her first name, said her district of Jinqiaozhen in Pudong has been allowing residents out of the compound, albeit with a curfew.\n\"I feel relieved and happy to be able to interact with friends from other districts and compounds again after not seeing them for over 70 days,\" she told The Straits Times before going on a ride around town on her electric scooter.\n\"The streets are filled with people biking and walking around.\"\nLawyer Xia Hailong, who returned to the office for the first time in two months on Wednesday, said subway carriages were largely empty, with the floors and train compartments feeling \u201cquite damp\u201d.\n\u201cIt felt strange seeing the platform staff in protective garb, but at the same time it was nice to somewhat go back into a routine,\u201d he said of his 30-minute subway ride to work.\n\u201cAt the office, I was very happy to discover that the plant beside my desk was still alive. It\u2019s a poetic metaphor for us, the people of Shanghai.\u201d\nBut other residents say they need time to adjust to their sudden levels of freedom.\n\u201cAfter being in lockdown for so long, it feels like I need to recalibrate instead of going out immediately,\u201d said marketing manager Eileen Tan, 45, who has not left home since end-March.\n\u201cAm I really happy? I have no idea. A bit hesitant, yes. We were in lockdown very suddenly and freed very abruptly,\u201d she told ST.\nHer husband, Sam, has said he is cautious about the lockdown being lifted so suddenly because it is still unclear if there could be other measures to come. But he plans to join his golfing buddies on the links on Thursday.\n\u201c(And) looking forward to meeting our friends and having some gatherings, so we\u2019re not having a drink with just ourselves anymore.\u201d\nSome food and beverage operators, however, say it might take a few days for them to restart business, citing tight supply and a need to deep-clean premises that have sat idle for at least eight weeks.\n\"It took us almost a month to get approval to reopen our Jumbo outlet in L\u2019Avenue,\" said Mr Ang Kiam Lian, chief executive (China) of the Jumbo Group of Restaurants.\nThe group has three Jumbo restaurants in Shanghai but so far, only one has reopened for delivery and takeaways - the other two are set to reopen on June 4.\nEmployees who helped restart the first outlet in late May were not allowed back into their housing compounds and had to stay in the restaurant, he told ST, calling it \"a very difficult two months\".\nHe declined to say how much the lockdown has cost them. He said: \"But it\u2019ll get better, Shanghai is Shanghai, and it will bounce back.\""}
