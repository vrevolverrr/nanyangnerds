{"title": "MOH doing more to curb popularity of vaping among the young, will study NZ's cohort ban on smoking", "tags": "singapore", "timestamp": "2022-01-11", "content": "SINGAPORE - Young people in Singapore no longer see smoking as glamorous and are aware of its harm, but are attracted to e-cigarettes that they are able to obtain despite them being banned here, said Senior Minister of State for Health Koh Poh Koon in Parliament on Tuesday (Jan 11).\nHence, the authorities will do more to enforce the current ban on the sale and possession of e-cigarettes and vaporisers here while continuing to review the tobacco tax rate, he said.\nDr Koh said Singapore is also open to studying New Zealand's cohort ban on smoking, and will look at how it implements the ban, its effectiveness, and how its experience could be applicable here.\nHe was responding to several questions raised by MPs on New Zealand's recently announced cohort ban, as well as on the topic of discouraging smoking.\nLast December, New Zealand announced its plans to raise the legal smoking age by one year every year, effectively banning the sale of tobacco to people born after 2008.\nDr Koh said that the cohort ban is an attractive proposal, as it prevents young people from taking up smoking while not putting too many restrictions on older smokers.\n\"Then of course, as the years go by, more and more cohorts are smoking-free,\" he added.\nBut he noted that in Singapore, young people are generally not becoming smokers, unlike their counterparts in other countries.\nThe bigger challenge here is instead the popularity of vaping products like e-cigarettes, which are still tobacco products and are harmful to users, he said.\nHe added that despite the outright ban on e-cigarettes in Singapore, they have found their way here through e-commerce.\nHe said: \"We will need to do more to enforce the current ban, to push back against the tide of popularity and increasing use.\"\nDr Koh noted that New Zealand is promoting vaping as an alternative to smoking.\n\"If vaping becomes entrenched among the younger generation, it undoes all the progress we made on curbing smoking, and will take an enormous effort over many years to curb its use.\"\nThe effectiveness of a cohort ban also depends on enforcement, said Dr Koh.\nThe most effective measure has been tobacco excise tax, which was last increased in 2018, said Dr Koh.\n\"With inflation and income increases, the tax burden gets eroded over time, and we will continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to review the tobacco tax rate,\" he said.\nHe noted that in 2020, standardised packaging and enhanced graphic health warnings were required for all tobacco products sold in Singapore, to reduce the attractiveness of cigarettes, but that it is still too early to evaluate the effectiveness of the measure.\nDr Koh also noted that the Republic has progressively raised the minimum legal age for smoking from 19 years in 2019 to 21 years in January 2021.\nThis has contributed to a decline in smoking among younger adults aged 18 to 29 years, from 9.8 per cent in 2017 to 8.8 per cent in 2020, he said.\nSmoking and second-hand smoke exposure are associated with at least 11 major medical conditions that accounted for about $180 million of healthcare costs in Singapore in 2019, he noted."}
