Mr Combs looks forward to having this judgment swiftly dismissed.\u201d\nSmith, who was sentenced to prison for 75 years on sexual misconduct and kidnapping charges, filed complaints against Combs in June and August. He was given a temporary restraining order against Combs, who has several other sexual assault cases still pending.\nCombs, founder of the landmark label Bad Boy Records, is one of the most influential producers and executives in hip-hop and a hugely successful performer. He is also the impresario of his own Sean John clothing line. REUTERS"}
