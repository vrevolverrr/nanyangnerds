He added that many of the companies GIC backed need to borrow funds and wanted rates to drop further.\n\u201cIn some ways, the interest rate markets are saying you need to cut rates by enough as if we\u2019re going into a recession, but the equity markets on the other hand still say we\u2019re going to re-accelerate the economy and earnings growth is going to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly one of them will be right.\u201d\nSpeaking on the same panel, Hillhouse founder Zhang Lei suggested using technology to enhance the skills and processes of businesses, while Granite Asia senior managing partner Jenny Lee said the days of 1,000 times in returns in Asia\u2019s venture capital space were over.
