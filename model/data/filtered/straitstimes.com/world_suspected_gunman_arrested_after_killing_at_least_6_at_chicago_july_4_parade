Crimo III, who was from the area. They said he was driving a silver 2010 Honda Fit car.\nPolice can be seen surrounding a car and then Crimo exiting the vehicle with his hands raised, according to a video by the Chicago affiliate of ABC News. Crimo lies flat on the ground before police take him into custody.\nCharges will be filed, Highland Park Police said.\nThe shooting caused toddlers to abandon tricycles and parents to run for safety with their children, turning a civic display of patriotism into a scene of panicked mayhem.\n\u201cIt sounded like fireworks going off,\u201d said retired doctor Richard Kaufman who was standing across the street from where the gunman opened fire, adding that he heard about 200 shots.\n\"It was pandemonium. A stampede. Babies were flying in the air. People were diving for cover,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were covered in blood tripping over each other.\u201d Police did not have a motive for the shooting.\nMore than 36 people were injured, mostly with gunshot wounds, said Jim Anthony, a spokesman for the NorthShore University HealthSystem. The 26 victims taken to the Highland Park hospital ranged in age from 8 to 85, said Brigham Temple, an emergency room doctor.\nThe New York Times named one of the dead as 76-year-old Nicolas Toledo, who was in a wheelchair and had not wanted to attend the parade, but his disabilities required that he be around someone full time and his family had not wanted to miss the event.\n\u201cWe were all in shock,\u201d his granddaughter Xochil Toledo said. \u201cWe thought it was part of the parade.\u201d\nAt least one of those killed was a Mexican national, a senior Mexican Foreign Ministry official said on Twitter.\nThe shooting comes with gun violence fresh on the minds of many Americans, after a massacre on May 24 killed 19 school children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, which followed a May 14 attack that killed 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York.\nAlong the parade route, abandoned chairs and other belongings could be seen scattered after panicked spectators fled for their lives.\n\u201cEveryone thought it was fireworks,\u201d one parade-goer, identified only as Zoe, told CNN. \u201cMy dad thought it was part of the show, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Dad, no... something is wrong.\u2019 And I grabbed him. And I looked back at him, and then it was just a sea of panic, and people just falling and falling.\u201d"}
