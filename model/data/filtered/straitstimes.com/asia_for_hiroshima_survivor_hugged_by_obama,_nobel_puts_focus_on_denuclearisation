When he came to, he saw a woman holding her own entrails, asking for the nearest hospital.\nAs an adult, he began a multi-decade quest to find how many victims were cremated at his school playground. His work also unearthed the identities of 12 Americans who died in the bombing.\nMr Obama, who spoke of the \u201cshared responsibility to look directly in the eye of history\u201d when he visited Hiroshima, praised Mr Mori\u2019s work in his speech.\nMr Obama avoided any direct expression of apology for the bombings, something many Japanese feel is overdue.\nMany nuclear bomb survivors \u2013 known as \u201chibakusha\u201d in Japanese - although advanced in age, and their numbers dwindling, have tried to keep the legacies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki alive, seeing the events in the cities as more than just moments of history, but calls for change.\nThat call appears to have resonated.\nMr Joergen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, warned that nuclear nations should not contemplate using nuclear weapons.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want all of this to end up being a dream,\u201d Mr Mori told Reuters last year, referring to his hopes for disarmament.
