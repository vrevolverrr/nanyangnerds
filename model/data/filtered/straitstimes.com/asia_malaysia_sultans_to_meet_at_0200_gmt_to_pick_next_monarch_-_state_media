The Southeast Asian country is a parliamentary democracy, with the monarch serving as head of state.\nThough the vote for the king is held by secret ballot, appointments have followed a rotation since independence, suggesting that Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, of the southern state of Johor, is in line to be the next king.\nThe new king will take over from Al-Sultan Abdullah, whose term expires on Jan. 30, 2024.\nUnlike other traditional Malaysian rulers, Sultan Ibrahim has been outspoken about politics and has said he has a good relationship with current prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.\nThe sultan, who is known to have a big collection of luxury cars and motorcycles, has wide-ranging business interests from real estate to mining.\nKing Al-Sultan played an unusually active role in Malaysian politics, picking the country's last three prime ministers.\nThe federal constitution grants the monarch only a few discretionary powers, with the king largely required to act upon the advice of the prime minister and cabinet.\nIt also allows the king to appoint a prime minister who he believes has a parliamentary majority, a power never utilised until 2020, as the premier is typically picked through an election.\nKing Al-Sultan used those powers during a period of political instability triggered by the defeat of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which had governed Malaysia uninterrupted since independence until 2018.
