It's an enormous effort,\" Erik Akerboom was quoted as saying by the Dutch ANP news agency.\n'Cover identity'\nCherkasov was a so-called \"illegal\" - spy parlance for an agent who has lived abroad under a fake identity for years - whose \"well-constructed cover identity\" hid all ties with Russia, the AIVD said.\nIn scenes that could have come from a spy novel, the Dutch even released a four-page document setting out Cherkasov's \"legend\" that was likely written by Cherkasov himself in around 2010.\nThe highly detailed document in Portuguese - but with grammatical mistakes - includes stories about his background, including his supposedly troubled relationship with his parents, his hatred of fish, his crush on a teacher.\nIt also tries to cover up doubts about his Brazilian heritage, saying that he was nicknamed \"Gringo\" because he \"looked like a German\" and includes full addresses of a restaurant in Brasilia with the \"best brown stew in town\" and a trance music club, in an apparent attempt to back up his cover story.\nThe Dutch intelligence service however pinpointed him as a \"threat to national security\" and notified the immigration service.\n\"On these grounds, the intelligence officer was refused entry into the Netherlands in April and declared unacceptable. He was sent back to Brazil on the first flight out,\" the AIVD said.\nThe Russian's internship would have given him access to the ICC's building and systems at a time when it is probing war crimes in Ukraine, including alleged Russian crimes since the Feb 24 invasion.\n\"For those reasons, covert access to International Criminal Court information would be highly valuable to the Russian intelligence services,\" the AIVD said.\nHad the Russian spy succeeded \"he would have been able to gather intelligence there and to look for (or recruit) sources, and arrange to have access to the ICC's digital systems,\" it added.\n\"He might also have been able to influence criminal proceedings of the ICC.\"\n'Important operation'\nBrazil's federal police said they had arrested a man, whom they did not name, in April after he was refused entry to the Netherlands because he was using fake ID.\n\"Using a sophisticated falsification scheme, he assumed the forged identity of a Brazilian whose parents are already dead,\" the police said in a statement, adding that he remains in detention pending trial.\nThe Russian had entered Brazil in 2010 and also lived in Ireland and the United States, before returning to Brazil to prepare for his move to the Netherlands.\nHe was due to start a \"six-month trial period at the International Criminal Court as a junior analyst in the Preliminary Examinations Section\", they said."}
