Ankara also halted all trade with Israel and applied to join a genocide case against Israel at the World Court.\nOn Monday, Erdogan met the leaders of Greece, Germany, Iran, and Kuwait, as well as the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, the Turkish Presidency said, adding he had discussed the war in Gaza in the meetings.\nErdogan told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that steps toward peace should be taken in response to Israel's hostility, his office said, adding that the Turkish leader also told chief prosecutor Karim Khan that Israel needed to be held accountable and that an ongoing genocide case against Israel at the ICC must be concluded.\nHe told Khan that Netanyahu's government \"did not hesitate to trample international law and human rights\", and that it was under the illusion that there is no power to stop it, it added.
