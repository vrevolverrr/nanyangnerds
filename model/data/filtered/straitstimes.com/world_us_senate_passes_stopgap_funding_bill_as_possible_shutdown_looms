Millions and millions of people can breathe easy,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said just before the vote.\nIn addition to money for federal agencies, the funding Bill includes US$12.3 billion in new money to help Ukraine turn back Russia's invasion.\nThe aid includes both military and economic assistance.\nThe Bill also authorises Biden to direct the drawdown of up to US$3.7 billion for the transfer to Ukraine of excess weapons from US stocks.\nAmid reports of Russian forces threatening the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants and Russian President Vladimir Putin hinting he might use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, the legislation would appropriate US$35 million \"to prepare for and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine,\" according to a Bill summary.\nThe stopgap Bill also includes a five-year renewal of Food and Drug Administration user fees being collected from drug and medical device companies to review their products and determine whether they are safe and effective, the Bill summary showed.\nThe law authorising the collection of fees expires on Friday.\nThe last time Congress allowed funding to lapse was in December 2018, when Democrats baulked at paying for then-president Donald Trump's US-Mexico border wall, leading to a record, 35-day impasse and partial government shutdown.
