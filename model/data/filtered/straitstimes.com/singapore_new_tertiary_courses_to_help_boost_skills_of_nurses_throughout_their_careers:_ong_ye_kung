Even so, it will continue to be an attractive and competitive course of study,\u201d he said.\nThe National University of Singapore will be launching two new postgraduate programmes in August.\nThe graduate certificates in Integrated Health and Critical Care Nursing are work-study programmes, which could take between 1\u00bd years and 4\u00bd years to complete. They give nurses the opportunity to develop their professional competencies through on-the-job training at the workplace, while concurrently advancing their professional development.\nTo nurture a practice-ready nursing workforce, the Singapore Institute of Technology is starting in September a new five-year integrated Bachelor of Science in Nursing \u2013 Master of Science in Nursing programme.\nGraduates will have to go through a three-year bachelor\u2019s-level study followed by a two-year master\u2019s-level study to prepare them for specialist nursing roles and groom them to be future nursing leaders.\nThey can go for further training in one of four specialisations: medical or surgical; high acuity care, which is short-term care provided to patients who need special supervision while recovering from a serious illness or injury; perioperative nursing; and community care nursing.\nIn October, a three-year work-study diploma in nursing will begin at ITE, giving enrolled nurses who are working the opportunity to obtain a nationally recognised diploma and take on more complex nursing tasks as registered nurses.\nITE has already replaced its two-year National ITE Certification (Nitec) in Nursing programme with a three-year Higher Nitec, which enhances the capabilities and knowledge of enrolled nurses to undertake an expanded scope of practice.\nMr Ong told healthcare professionals at the ceremony to never believe the assertion that nobody wants to join nursing.\nHe said about one in 25 students will end up studying nursing, and every year during application season, he and other MPs get numerous appeals from Singaporeans who want to get into nursing but could not.\n\u201cLast year, we set a national target to hire 4,000 new nurses, after experiencing high attrition in 2021 and 2022 due to Covid-19 (when) many of our nurses were poached. We have since turned the tide.\u201d\nPCN is a network of GPs supported by nurses and care coordinators, which provides holistic and coordinated care to patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. This team-based care approach ensures patients are better cared for in the community.\nA nurse by training, Ms Chioh, 62, was seconded from AIC in 2012 to work with general practitioners in private practice on the PCN concept.\nShe helped to develop the training frameworks and competency roadmaps that empowered nurses with the necessary skills and knowledge to adapt to the evolving demands of primary care.\n\u201cI (worked) for 12 years to understand the challenges faced by both the GPs and nurses before we could build a team successfully for PCN. Many of the nurses hailed from different parts of hospitals \u2013 emergency departments, operating rooms and wards,\u201d she told The Straits Times.\n\u201cThe challenges they face in primary care would then be different from what they know. To help them, we built training frameworks and SOPs (standard operating procedures) for them (to) understand the fundamentals when managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure,\u201d she said.\nToday, there are 10 PCNs that duplicate what Ms Chioh started with nine Frontier GP clinics.\nAnother recipient who played a critical role in educating the next generation of nurses was Ms Maslinna Abdul Rahman, 39, a nurse clinician at the Singapore General Hospital.\nAs a faculty and module lead, she was instrumental in establishing the Master of Health Sciences \u2013 Organ Transplant Nursing, which was originally a renal transplant nursing course at the hospital. It has evolved into a master\u2019s programme for nursing students specialising in solid organ transplant nursing.\n\u201cThis award serves as a tangible symbol of success. I still feel I have so much more to work on in the aspects of advancing clinical nursing and also in education to novice nurses,\u201d she said.\nMs Chioh and Ms Maslinna were among the 150 nurses from various care settings spanning the community care sectors who received the Nurses\u2019 Merit Award from Mr Ong.\nStarted in 1976, the award is presented to nurses who have displayed noteworthy and exceptional performance, participated in professional development, and contributed to raising the nursing profession.\nThe nurses are nominated for the award by their healthcare institutions and selected by a panel set up by MOH.\nCorrection note: This story has been edited for clarity."}
