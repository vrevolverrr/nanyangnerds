She did not say if Najib\u2019s pardon bid was discussed.\n\u201cJust wait for the official statement from the Pardons Board,\u201d she said.\nThe Edge reported on Jan 30 that the board had discussed the case in what is King Abdullah Ahmad Shah\u2019s last official meeting before passing the reins to Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar this week as part of the South-east Asian nation\u2019s rotating monarchy.\nThe report did not say when the decision would be made public.\nThe board was scheduled to meet on Jan 29, and it was reported earlier that it might consider Najib\u2019s bid for a pardon from his convictions related to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal.\nUtusan Malaysia reported on Jan 30 that Najib had been granted a royal pardon, citing unnamed sources. But the Malay-language news outlet later issued an apology over the article.\n\u201cUtusan has retracted the article because the facts cannot be verified. Therefore, we apologise to our readers,\u201d it said in a statement.\nMalaysian Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said any news about Najib\u2019s appeal for a royal pardon should come from the Pardons Board and not be based on unnamed sources.\n\u201cSometimes, the authenticity of the source cannot be ascertained, hence it is important to verify the information received,\u201d he said.\nNajib is serving a 12-year prison sentence for several charges in the case involving RM42 million (S$11.9 million) in funds belonging to SRC International, a former unit of the troubled state fund.\nHe has exhausted all legal avenues of appeal and can be released from prison only by a royal pardon from Malaysia\u2019s King.\nNajib\u2019s lawyer and the Malaysian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}
