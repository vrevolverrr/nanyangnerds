It said more details of the revamp will be made public later.\nNLB chief executive Ng Cher Pong said this is being done in tandem with the mall\u2019s upgrading and will allow the library to better serve the larger community of residents in the area.\nMall owner Singapore Land Group (SingLand) said on Monday that West Mall\u2019s refurbishment, which began in the first half of 2023, is slated to be done in 2025. The mall, which is next to Bukit Batok MRT station, will remain fully operational throughout as the work takes place in phases.\nBesides the bigger library, other moves include converting the mall\u2019s open plaza into a sheltered one, which will help to promote social interaction through future programming, SingLand said. Such programmes include community engagement activities and seasonal or festival-themed events.\nThe sheltered plaza will come with new food and beverage spaces.\nThe mall\u2019s basement is set to house an expanded line-up of food and beverage and lifestyle stores, said SingLand.\nThe developer said in its 2022 annual report that the refurbishment exercise will add about 20,000 sq ft of retail space that will help the mall serve residents of the new Tengah town.\nThe six-storey mall, including a basement floor, is on a 99-year lease that began on March 1, 1995, and has a net lettable area of about 183,000 sq ft.\nNLB will set up a nearby 24-hour book dispenser and reservation lockers in 2024 for patrons to pick up reserved items when the library is closed.\nPatrons are also encouraged to visit nearby libraries, tap NLB\u2019s e-resources or have up to four library items delivered to their homes for a fee through the board\u2019s Borrow-n-Deliver service.\nBukit Batok resident Mary Aw, 58, said that compared with nearby malls such as Jem and Westgate in Jurong East, West Mall loses out in size, which may make the impact of any upgrade limited, as the mall cannot compete with the offerings of larger complexes.\n\u201cPerhaps those living nearby will benefit most (from the revamp),\u201d said the human resources manager, noting that the expanded food and beverage offerings may become the mall\u2019s main draw.\nFellow resident Lee Jo May, 38, who visits the library about once a month, said she hopes the expanded space will house a cafe, so that library-goers can have some food as they read.\nThe mother of two, who works in sales, added that more seating in the library\u2019s children\u2019s section would also be welcome."}
