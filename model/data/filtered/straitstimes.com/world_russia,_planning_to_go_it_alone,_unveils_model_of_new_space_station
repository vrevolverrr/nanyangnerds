That would later be followed by a further two modules and a service platform, it said. That would be enough, when completed, to accommodate up to four cosmonauts as well as scientific equipment.\nRoskosmos has said the new station would afford Russian cosmonauts a much wider view of the Earth for monitoring purposes than they enjoy in their current segment.\nAlthough designs for some of the new station already exist, design work is still underway on other segments.\nRussian state media have suggested that the launch of the first stage is planned for 2025-26 and no later than 2030.\nLaunch of the second and final stage is planned for 2030-35, they have reported.\nThe space station, as currently conceived, would not have a permanent human presence but would be staffed twice a year for extended periods.\nDmitry Rogozin, the previous head of Roskosmos and a hardliner known for his tough statements against the West, has suggested that the new space station could fulfil a military purpose if necessary."}
