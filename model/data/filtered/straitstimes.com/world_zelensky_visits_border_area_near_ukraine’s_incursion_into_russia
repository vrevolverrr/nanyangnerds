The operation into the Kursk region has given a major morale boost to the Ukrainian military after months of slow but steady Russian gains in the east.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will deliver a \"worthy response\" to the incursion, which he has described as a major provocation.\nUkraine has closely guarded its overarching aims in the Kursk region, but said it has carved out a buffer zone from an area that Russia has used to pound targets in Ukraine with cross-border strikes.\nIn a statement accompanying the video, Mr Zelensky wrote that there had been a decrease in shelling and in civilian casualties in the Sumy region since the Kursk operation.\nMr Zelensky said Col-Gen Syrskyi had briefed him on steps taken by Ukraine to reinforce its defences on the eastern fronts near the settlements of Toretsk and Pokrovsk, where Moscow's forces have concentrated their offensive for months.
