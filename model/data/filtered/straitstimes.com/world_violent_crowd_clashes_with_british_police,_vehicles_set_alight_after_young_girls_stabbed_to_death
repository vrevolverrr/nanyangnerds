One video posted online showed the crowd chanting \u201cwe want our country back\u201d.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said the situation was unacceptable, and added: \u201cYesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face.\n\u201cTonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\u201d\nWitnesses to the attack on July 29 described what they saw as being like a scene from a horror film.\nEight other children suffered stab wounds and five remained in a critical condition. Two adults were also critically wounded while attempting to protect the young victims, the police said.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the town earlier on July 30, and King Charles and his family expressed their shock. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told Parliament that people must not speculate about the motive of the attack.\nUS singer Swift wrote on Instagram that she was \u201cjust completely in shock\u201d.\n\u201cThese were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\u201d\nHer fans have raised more than \u00a3125,000 (S$215,000) online to help families of the victims and for the hospital where some of the children were being treated.\nThe three girls who died in the attack were named as Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\u201cKeep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you\u2019re always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy,\u201d Alice\u2019s family said in a statement.\nMerseyside police said the motive was unclear but added that they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the stabbings, amid fevered speculation on social media about the suspect, who was born in Cardiff and lived in a nearby village.\n\u201cWe have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time,\u201d Assistant Chief Constable Goss said.\nThe attack has shocked Southport, a quiet seaside town, and the country as a whole. Mr Starmer paid a sombre visit to the scene on July 30 to lay flowers and to meet the police and paramedics who responded to the incident.\n\u201cI came here to pay my respects to the victims and families who are going through raw pain and grief that most of us can\u2019t imagine, I can\u2019t imagine as a dad myself,\u201d he told reporters.\nThere has been increasing concern at rising levels of stabbings and knife crime in Britain, and the Southport attack follows other recent similar, indiscriminate rampages.\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely determined that my government will get to grips with it,\u201d Mr Starmer said.
