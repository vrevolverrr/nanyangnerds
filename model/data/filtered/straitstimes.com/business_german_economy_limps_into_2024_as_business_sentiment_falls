Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the indicator to improve in January to 86.7.\n\u201cThe German economy is stuck in recession,\u201d said ifo president Clemens Fuest.\nGerman gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.3 per cent in 2023.\n\u201cThe tentative revival of optimism last autumn has turned out to be very short-lived,\u201d said ING economist Carsten Brzeski, forecasting another shallow recession this year of -0.3 per cent.\nIn 2023, Germany was plagued by persistently high inflation, high energy prices and weak foreign demand, and topped off with a budget meltdown that prompted deep subsidy cuts while rattling the nation\u2019s fractious coalition government.\nAs trade disruptions caused by Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea bring fresh concerns for Germany\u2019s export industry, the closely watched composite PMI index fell for a seventh consecutive month in January.\nHowever, ifo\u2019s head of surveys Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters that supply chains remained robust in the face of the Red Sea attacks.\n\u201cThey have not yet led to supply bottlenecks for raw materials and primary products,\u201d Dr Wohlrabe said.\n2024 Recession Fears\nThe start of the new year also brought mass farmer protests and nationwide rail strikes, as discontent grows over Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s economic policies.\nOn Jan 24, the ifo revised down its growth estimate, with the economy now expected to rebound by a meagre 0.7 per cent this year.\nFurther highlighting Germany\u2019s economic woes, particularly the outlook for its struggling property sector, other data released on Jan 25 showed incoming orders in the country\u2019s construction industry fell 7.4 per cent month-on-month in November\n\u201cMost economists are still too optimistic,\u201d said Dr Joerg Kraemer of Commerzbank, which is also expecting a 0.3 per cent decline in GDP this year.\nThe ifo\u2019s current assessment and expectations components, based on a survey of around 9,000 managers, also dimmed in January.\n\u201cThe business climate is keeping hopes for growth in the current quarter at zero,\u201d said Mr Alexander Krueger of Hacuk Aufhaeuser Lampe.\n\u201cUnfavourable location conditions and unsettling economic policy are major problems,\u201d he added.
