Accepting this award means my actions weren\u2019t wrong. I hope I can give courage to people, and to the people that cannot stand up for themselves,\u201d Ms Gonoi told Reuters in an exclusive interview.\nA Japanese court in December 2023 found three former soldiers guilty of sexually assaulting Ms Gonoi, who joined Japan\u2019s Self-Defence Forces after receiving aid from them as an evacuee when a massive earthquake struck the north-east coast of Japan in March 2011.\nShe quit the military, however, after officers ignored her complaint over an incident in 2021 in which she was pinned down by three male colleagues, who simulated a sex act on her.\n\u201cMs Gonoi\u2019s bravery to take on social norms emboldened countless survivors of abuse to come forward with their own stories so that they no longer suffered in silence,\u201d said the US statement on the award winners.\nAfter Ms Gonoi went public with her accusations in 2022, Japan\u2019s Defence Ministry issued a public apology and began a widespread survey of harassment in the military and military-linked entities that found more than 1,400 complaints.\n\u201cIt is an award for women, but I always say women and men should work together to make our society better. It\u2019s not about being a woman or man. People should proactively take action for the right things and stand up for themselves,\u201d Ms Gonoi told Reuters. REUTERS"}
