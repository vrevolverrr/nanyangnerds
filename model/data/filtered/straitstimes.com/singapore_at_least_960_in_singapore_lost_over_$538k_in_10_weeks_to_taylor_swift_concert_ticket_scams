If I were to make an assessment, I think e-commerce scams will be the top scam in the first half of 2024 if this trend continues.\u201d\nIn 2023, the most common ruse victims fell prey to was job scams. E-commerce scams were the second most common scam that year, with 9,783 cases reported and at least $13.9 million lost.\nAC Yap added that most of the e-commerce scam victims who made reports relating to tickets to Swift\u2019s concerts were women aged 30 and below.\nOptimism bias \u2013 the belief that one is less likely to experience a negative event compared with others \u2013 and overconfidence bias \u2013 the tendency to overestimate one\u2019s knowledge \u2013 are among several factors that could have led some victims to be deceived, explained AC Yap.\n\u201cThe issue of concert ticket scams is a challenge for us because there isn\u2019t a straightforward way to totally combat it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPerhaps scalping can be regulated, because there are people who make thousands of dollars every time there is a major concert here by buying tickets in bulk and selling them at much higher prices. Others design bots just to purchase tickets at a fast rate.\u201d\nAC Yap commended online marketplace Carousell for suspending the sale of tickets to Swift\u2019s concerts on its platform between Feb 23 and March 9 to prevent users from being scammed.\nCarousell\u2019s chief of staff Tan Su Lin said on March 13 that amid the rush for tickets, users were not catching on to scam indicators, such as sellers\u2019 ratings that show if other buyers had found them to be reliable.\nScammers also targeted victims on other platforms such as Facebook, X, Telegram and Xiaohongshu, said AC Yap.\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m concerned because as Singapore looks to host more concerts, we may have to anticipate more of such scams. Scammers can take advantage of these major concerts to proliferate their business.\u201d\nNational University of Singapore business professor Lawrence Loh said: \u201cSingapore\u2019s standing as a cultural hub is because of our infrastructure, facilities, connectivity and overall landscape. Scams should be closely watched, but I believe it will not affect the reputation we have for holding events well.\u201d\nIn fact, enforcement efforts by the authorities to clamp down on concert ticket scammers show foreigners that Singapore does not take scams lightly, he added.\nProf Loh noted the arrest of a 29-year-old woman who allegedly cheated victims of more than $24,000 on the pretext of selling tickets to Swift\u2019s concerts.\nAnother growing scam of concern here in the past year is that relating to malware, said AC Yap.\nIt was the sixth most common scam in 2023. There were 1,899 such cases reported, with $34.1 million lost.\nAC Yap recounted a case in which a 50-year-old widow with two sons, aged 10 and 12, almost lost $110,000 to a malware scam.\nMost of the money in her bank account was from the life insurance payout of her husband, who died in 2022.\nSaid AC Yap: \u201cShe downloaded a file on Facebook thinking she could use it to pay for groceries. But after she keyed in her banking details, her phone was compromised and money was transferred out of her DBS account.\u201d\nDBS Bank informed ASCom, whose officers tracked the funds to another bank and asked that the money be held there. Meanwhile, another officer called the victim to tell her she had fallen for a scam.\nBut the victim did not believe the officer was legitimate, said AC Yap.\nShe said: \u201cWhen we tried to call her again, she blocked the number on her phone, and we couldn\u2019t get through to her.\u201d\nThe officer went to her home, but she was not in. Ironically, she had gone to make a police report.\nAC Yap said: \u201cBecause of the swift intervention of the officers, we managed to prevent her from losing her life savings and the insurance payout.\u201d\nStaff from six banks \u2013 DBS, OCBC, UOB, Standard Chartered, HSBC and CIMB \u2013 and the Government Technology Agency have been deployed at ASCom to tackle scam incidents more quickly.\nCarousell\u2019s staff joined them on Jan 30."}
