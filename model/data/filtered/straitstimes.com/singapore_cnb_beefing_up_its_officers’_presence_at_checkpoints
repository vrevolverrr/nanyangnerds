And when they come back, they will also see signs (that are) prominent,\u201d added Mr Tee, 52, who became CNB\u2019s director-designate on Aug 15 and director on Nov 6.\nThere have been reports of accidental consumption of cannabis overseas.\nMr Tee, formerly senior director of the Joint Operations Group in the Ministry of Home Affairs, advised travellers to assume responsibility for checking for cannabis labels and asking what is in the dishes they order.\n\u201cIf you consume it intentionally, then we have our ways to profile, observe upon your arrival. And then we may subject you to some form of test,\u201d he said, adding that the detection and arrest of returning travellers happen daily.\nMr Tee, who is also a former commander of the Airport Police Division and Traffic Police, said the liberalisation of drugs around the world is making people in Singapore think about what it should be like here.\n\u201cDomestically it is also a concern, because our people are getting more liberal, especially the youth. And in their mind, (they think) this is just soft drugs. \u2018I watch Netflix and I see people taking drugs and it looks okay, it looks cool.\u2019\n\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t help that our people also go overseas for exchanges and holidays. And those drugs are widely available, particularly cannabis,\u201d he said.\nBased on preliminary statistics for the first nine months of 2022, Mr Tee said there are signs that cannabis abuse is quickly returning to its pre-Covid-19 level, with the number of abusers, particularly those younger than 20, and the volume of the drug seized having already outstripped 2021 figures.\nHe cited a recent case where five teenagers aged 14 to 16 were arrested for suspected trafficking of cannabis, and said it is \u201cmadness\u201d that teenagers are not only consuming but also selling drugs.\nHe highlighted another case of a 17-year-old who was recently charged in court, together with an 18-year-old and a 22-year-old, for trafficking more than 4kg of cannabis that had a street value of at least $120,000."}
