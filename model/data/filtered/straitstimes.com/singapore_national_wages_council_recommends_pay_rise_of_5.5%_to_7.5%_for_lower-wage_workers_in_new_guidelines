Thanaletchimi noted that the latest guidelines still call for employers who have done well to reward their employees with variable payments, including one-off payments, in line with how employers and employees have performed.\nAsked if the recommendations supersede mandatory increases to the Progressive Wage Model, Permanent Secretary for Manpower Ng Chee Khern said the new guidelines for lower-wage workers are set to outpace the growth of the median wage.\nThe model refers to wage ladders that spell out wage rises in tandem with productivity and skill improvements.\n\u201cWhat happens from here is that the NWC recommendations will inform the progressive wage negotiations that will take place in the coming year,\u201d Mr Ng said.\nHe added that in 2023, 62.3 per cent of companies that did well and had positive business prospects gave employees both wage increases and an annual variable component, according to a poll by MOM.\nOver 73 per cent of those that did well but faced uncertain business prospects also provided an annual variable component.\nAsked whether businesses facing financial difficulties should strive to meet the guidelines or instead invest in processes and workers\u2019 upskilling, and fall short of the guidelines, labour MP Patrick Tay said it was possible to do both by tapping support schemes, including grants from the labour movement and the Government.\n\u201cWe really urge then to leverage all those so that, instead of spending their own money, tap some of these grants to support them in their journey, (and) at the same time plough back savings they have to (invest) in training, transformation and job redesign.\u201d\nMr Goh Jia Yong, partner in people consulting at Ernst and Young Advisory, told The Straits Times that the guidelines offer help for employers to establish competitive and fair wage practices to adopt.\nEven companies that are not doing well financially may still wish to strive to meet the lower end of the NWC guidelines to retain talent, he said.\nNonetheless, he suggested that more can still be done to guide employers on how to tap existing support schemes.\n\u201cProviding tailored advice to individual employers on planning and managing such transformation efforts can optimise returns on investment.\u201d"}
