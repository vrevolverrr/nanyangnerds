Assault rates in prison dropped from about 62 per 10,000 inmates in 2022 to 54 per 10,000 inmates in 2023.\nIn addition, the two-year recidivism rate has been among the lowest in the world, with 22 per cent for the 2021 release cohort, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was the guest of honour at the event.\nHe said the aim is not just to secure and rehabilitate inmates, but also to uplift them together with their families.\n\u201cFor ex-offenders, getting and staying in a job is critical in both keeping them from reoffending, and for getting them to uplift themselves,\u201d said Mr Shanmugam.\nIn 2023, family-focused programmes benefited slightly more than 3,000 inmates, he added.\nThe year 2024 also marks 20 years of the Yellow Ribbon Project (YRP) in championing second chances for former offenders.\nMr Shanmugam launched the YRP 20th Anniversary celebrations with a new campaign that shifts towards stronger community advocacy and active participation in the second-chances movement.\nSPS also partnered more than 20 agencies to support families with children impacted by detention of their parents, involving around 1,000 children.\nIn addition, inmates released on supervision are able to help themselves via the Self-Help and Rehabilitation e-Resources, or Share, mobile app, which provides easy access to information that can facilitate their reintegration into the community."}
