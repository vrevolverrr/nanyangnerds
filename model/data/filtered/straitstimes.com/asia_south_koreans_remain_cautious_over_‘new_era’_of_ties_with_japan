The president should try to understand the people\u2019s thoughts before making a move.\u201d\nA retired banker in his 60s said the Seoul foundation scheme is wrong because money was not what Koreans have been asking for.\n\u201cKoreans rather kept seeking it to receive a proper apology. However, the president screwed it up. Yoon made an extreme choice to establish his achievements during his term in office.\u201d\nOthers said the Korea-Japan summit should be evaluated from a practical point of view and that it is the time to move on from the past wrongdoings.\n\u201cI want Korea and Japan to make peace about the historical issue. It has been too long and tedious for decades,\u201d a 34-year-old businessman surnamed Kwon.\n\u201cHowever, it seems that they are taking a step forward, both diplomatically and economically, by lifting regulations on exports of chip materials in the wake of the summit. So it is good if there are practical benefits.\u201d\nMr Kang, a 34-year-old office worker, said he thinks it was right to hold the summit, considering security issues over North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear threat.\n\u201cI know there are criticisms that there was not enough discussion with the public, but the government got the advantage of making a quick decision by increasing efficiency,\u201d he said.\nA recent survey in the wake of the new compensation plan, however, indicated Koreans\u2019 negative moods towards Seoul\u2019s efforts to mend fences with Tokyo.\nAccording to a survey by Gallup Korea of 1,002 respondents from March 8-9, only 35 per cent were in favour of the Seoul\u2019s third-party compensation to forced labour victims for the national interest of South Korea.\nFifty-nine per cent opposed Seoul\u2019s proposal, given it missed out on Japan\u2019s sincere apology and direct compensation to the victims.\nThe younger generation tended to be against the decision. By ages of the respondents, 75 per cent of those in their 30s and 78 per cent of those in their 40s opposed the proposal.\nOn the other hand, the proportion of those against the proposal among people aged between 50 and 59 came to 59 per cent. The proportion of such respondents in their 60s stood at 41 per cent, and that of people in their 70s or older only amounted to 39 per cent.\nThe poll also showed that 3 in 10 prioritised Seoul\u2019s step backwards regarding the forced labour dispute over Tokyo\u2019s sincere apology to seek improved bilateral ties.\nSixty-four per cent, however, answered that Tokyo\u2019s U-turn over the approach to the forced labour issues must precede the improvement of the Seoul-Tokyo relationship.\nA majority of those in their 60s, 70s and older answered that a swift improvement in the bilateral relationship should be in place whatever the circumstances.\nThis also showed contrast with that of the younger generation, as less than 20 per cent of people in their 30s and 40s responded that improved ties are more important than Japan\u2019s apology.
