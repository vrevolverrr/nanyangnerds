An investigation is ongoing into the incident.\nRussian intelligence-gathering planes also frequently cruise near Norway, in light of Moscow's interests in the Arctic Circle.\nMoscow is making the so-called Northern Sea Route, which runs along its Arctic coastline, a key part of its strategy to boost natural gas exports to Asia.\nThe Nato alliance, which includes the US and 29 other countries as members, employs as many as 8,000 people for air policing.\nIn addition to Uedem, a centre in Torrejon, Spain, monitors traffic in the southern part of the alliance. Around 30 surveillance and fighter jets are in the air at any one time monitoring Nato airspace."}
