In June, Apple announced that devices including its latest version of iPhones would get upgrades that include \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d a slew of generative AI-powered features within native applications, and an integration with ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of AI announcements in a short burst of time as of late. I don\u2019t think you want to sit on it too long if you\u2019re Google,\u201d said IDC analyst Linn Huang.\nNew AI integrations announced on Aug 13 include a Pixel-only feature that lets users search for information stored in screenshots. Android users can also now pull up Gemini, Google\u2019s chatbot, as an overlay on top of another app to answer questions or generate content.\n\u201cThere have been so many promises, so many coming soons, and not enough real-world helpfulness when it comes to AI, which is why today we\u2019re getting real,\u201d said Mr Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice-president of devices and services. \u201cWe\u2019re fully in the Gemini era.\u201d\nEmployees showcased several live demos of new Gemini functions, such as a voice conversation feature, though an attempt to use Gemini to cross-reference a picture of a concert poster with the calendar app took three tries and two devices to run successfully.\nBut the Pixel line has also enabled Google to show off advances and spur the developer ecosystem around its Android operating system, which is used by device manufacturers like Samsung. Android represents one of several frontlines where Google is battling competitors to embed AI in ways that consumers will use. In May, it debuted a swath of upgrades to core products like its search engine.\nThe company\u2019s engineers redesigned the Pixel\u2019s exterior and included camera upgrades as well as Google\u2019s new Tensor G4 chip.\nGoogle announced new versions of its smartwatch, the Pixel Watch 3, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 wireless earbuds on Aug 13 as well.
