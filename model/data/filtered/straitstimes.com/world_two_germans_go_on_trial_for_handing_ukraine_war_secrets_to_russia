They were charged in September.\nBoth face an additional charge for having \u201cunauthorised contact with each other in the pre-trial detention centre\u201d, where they could have \u201cexchanged information that could influence the proceedings\u201d, Ms Jani said.\nCarsten L\u2019s lawyer, Mr Johannes Eisenberg, said in a statement there was \u201cno objective evidence whatsoever\u201d for his client\u2019s alleged treason.\nMr Eisenberg complained of a \u201cshow trial\u201d after judges said the highly sensitive nature of the accusations meant part of the charge sheet could be kept secret.\nGermany has been shaken by several cases of alleged spying for Russia since the invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, amid suggestions that officials in Berlin are too sympathetic with Moscow.\nEarlier this year, a German national working for the military was arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia.\nAnd in November 2022, a German man was handed a suspended sentence for passing information to Russian intelligence services while working as a reserve officer for the German army.
