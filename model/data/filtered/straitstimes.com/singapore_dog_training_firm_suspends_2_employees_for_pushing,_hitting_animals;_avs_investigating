The caption says that they are arranging the dogs for a \u201cphoto op\u201d.\nIn one of the videos, one of the men pushes down on a dog\u2019s back to get it to sit.\nWhen the dog stands back up, the man uses both his arms to shove the dog down again and it eventually sits.\nThe other employee drags another dog, before appearing to hit it on its body and head to get it to stay in place.\nIn a statement on his company\u2019s Instagram page posted late on Jan 15, the firm\u2019s owner Xavian Mar said he was aware of the videos and that these displayed \u201cdisgustingly inappropriate behaviour\u201d towards the animals in its care.\nHe said: \u201cThis is definitely not what Xavian and Pack stands for and will not condone any of such behaviours.\n\u201cAs a dog parent myself, I would definitely not want my dogs to be treated that way.\u201d\nMr Mar also clarified that he was \u201cnot present in the video\u201d.\nHe added that the two employees in the video had been \u201csuspended with immediate effect and will not be part of Xavian and Pack\u201d, and also vowed to conduct a review.\n\u201cWe will be scrutinising all aspects of our services moving forward to avoid such events from happening.\u201d\nMr Joshua Teoh, director of the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS), said that it was aware of the videos and is investigating the matter.\nMr Teoh also said that safeguarding animal welfare is a \u201cshared social responsibility\u201d and urged members of the public to report suspected cases of animal cruelty to AVS via its website at www.avs.gov.sg/feedback or through its Animal Response Centre on 1800-476-1600.\nInformation shared with AVS is kept strictly confidential, he added.\nMs Aarthi Sankar, executive director at the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), said that the society is against the use of \u201caversive training methods\u201d, which include the use of tools such as shock, choke or prong collars.\n\u201cForce should never be used on animals. They are sentient beings, capable of expressing their preferences and feelings,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is essential to understand and respect their behavioural cues.\u201d\nMs Sankar said that the trainer\u2019s attempt to manipulate the dog into a sitting position against its wishes or forcing dogs to take part in activities they are not comfortable with can cause unnecessary distress and even injuries.\nShe said there were nine cases of dog abuse involving trainers in 2023, and added that animal training providers should have stringent recruitment processes, regular training and auditing of staff, and a code of conduct for employees to adhere to.\n\u201cAll staff should also go through proper assessment and obtain the relevant certification from governing bodies before they are allowed to handle animals without supervision,\u201d she said.\nUnder the Animals and Birds Act, any person who is found guilty of animal cruelty in the course of an animal-related business can be fined up to $40,000, jailed for up to two years, or both. A disqualification order of up to 12 months may also be considered.\nFirst-time offenders caught abusing an animal may be charged under the same Act, and can be fined up to $15,000, jailed for up to 18 months, or both."}
