Retailers of watches and jewellery saw a similar rise of 12.9 per cent on greater demand for jewellery.\nIn contrast, retailers of recreational goods recorded a year-on-year decrease in sales of 10.6 per cent, and the furniture and household equipment industry a 5.6 per cent drop in November 2023.\nFood and alcohol sales were up year on year but down month on month, which could suggest that momentum could be petering out as more Singaporeans travel overseas, said Ms Selena Ling, chief economist and head of global markets research and strategy for OCBC Bank.\nOn a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, sales of motor vehicles rose 5.6 per cent in November 2023. Similarly, retailers of furniture and household equipment saw an increase in sales of 4.1 per cent while department store sales were up 3.3 per cent."}
