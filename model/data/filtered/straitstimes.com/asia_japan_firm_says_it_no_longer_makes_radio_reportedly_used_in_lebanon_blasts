It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company,\u201d Icom said in a statement.\n\u201cThe production of the batteries needed to operate the main unit has also been discontinued, and a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company,\u201d it said.\nIt added that products for overseas markets are sold exclusively through its authorised distributors, and that its export programme is based on Japanese security trade control regulations.\n\u201cAll of our radios are manufactured at our production subsidiary, Wakayama Icom, in Wakayama prefecture, under a strict management system... so no parts other than those specified by our company are used in a product. In addition, all of our radios are manufactured at the same factory, and we do not manufacture them overseas,\u201d the statement said.\nIn the second wave of device explosions in as many days, 20 people died and more than 450 were wounded on Sept 18 in Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, officials said.\nA source close to Hezbollah said walkie-talkies used by its members blew up in its Beirut stronghold, with state media reporting similar blasts in south and east Lebanon.\nThey came a day after the simultaneous explosion of hundreds of paging devices used by Hezbollah killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded up to 2,800 others across Lebanon, in an unprecedented attack blamed on Israel.\nThere was no comment from Israel. The White House warned all sides against \u201can escalation of any kind\u201d. AFP"}
