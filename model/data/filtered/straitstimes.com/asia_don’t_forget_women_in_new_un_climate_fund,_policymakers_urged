Globally, about 76 per cent of such work is shouldered by women.\nWhen extreme weather causes shortages of food, they often sacrifice their portion for other family members and face particular risks to their health and well-being \u2013 from pregnancy complications to domestic violence.\nIn Botswana, as a drought becomes acute in the semi-arid country, Ms Mokgatlhane said the decimation of goat herds and dwindling incomes were hitting women\u2019s mental health and forcing them to seek government aid from officials who had little understanding of their needs and priorities.\nWomen also find it harder to navigate the sometimes-complex bureaucracy to get help, she added.\nClimate justice\nAs the new global fund takes shape and potential recipients line up, quantifying and monetising the burdens and damages faced by women is vital for ensuring climate justice, said Ms Farah Kabir, country director for the ActionAid charity in Bangladesh.\n\u201cIt is pointless to vaguely speak about women\u2019s additional burden \u2013 you need to do the studies and get accurate data to address it,\u201d Ms Kabir said.\nWhile previous climate finance mechanisms were often born without clear gender guidelines, the loss and damage fund should integrate the gender lens from the start, Ms Kabir said.\nGathering gender-disaggregated data should be a priority, said Ms Lorena Aguilar, an expert on the gendered dimensions of climate change and executive director at the Kaschak Institute for Social Justice for Women and Girls at US-based Binghamton University.\n\u201cCommunities are not homogeneous, and the same community members are affected differently depending on age, sex, economic power,\u201d she said.\nIn March, the UK-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) think-tank unveiled a tool that could measure the various dimensions of loss and damage faced by vulnerable populations such as women.\nThe tool, called C-CIQ methodology, addresses the various kinds of loss and damage affecting communities \u2013 from the loss of assets such as crops or homes to more intangible damage including the destruction of an ancestral burial ground, or mental illness.\n\u201cThe whole purpose is to quantify and attach dollar values to loss and damage for even relatively less visible issues like mental health problems or a growing care burden faced by women \u2013 in a simple method that can be applied by even local NGOs,\u201d said Ms Ritu Bharadwaj, lead researcher of the IIED\u2019s climate and finance team.\nGrassroots women\u2019s groups must have the possibility of direct access to the fund\u2019s resources, said Mr Sunil Acharya, regional policy and campaigns coordinator for Oxfam in Asia.\nThe complex application procedures of existing climate funds, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), make it harder for small, local groups to access project funding, he said.\nIn countries at high risk from climate change impacts, such as Botswana, NGOs like Mokgatlhane\u2019s are already using a bottom-up approach \u2013 consulting women in vulnerable communities and drawing on Indigenous knowledge when designing projects.\nThe strategy, which she urged the UN fund to adopt, means funding is more likely to hit the mark.\n\u201cIf a woman is kept abreast of the radical climatic impacts, consulted in the making of the climate action plans and policies, and given access to resources, then surely she can make our nation better,\u201d Ms Mokgatlhane said.
