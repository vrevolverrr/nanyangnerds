The second stage of the reopening will happen from June 21, when dining in at eateries may be allowed, with a maximum group size of five.\nSuch restrictions are needed in phase three (heightened alert) until Singapore's vaccination rate is higher, said Mr Wong.\n\"It is not quite the full phase three, we call this phase three (heightened alert) because there are still these restrictions in place.\""}
