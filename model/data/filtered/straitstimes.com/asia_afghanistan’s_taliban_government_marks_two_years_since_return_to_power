Today marks the end of the occupation in our country, and that is a good thing,\u201d 21-year-old Mortaza Khairi said.\n\u2018Want their freedom back\u2019\nAfghan women ahead of the anniversary have expressed fear and despair over the loss of rights \u2013 a handful holding small demonstrations, many of their faces covered with masks.\nBut Afghans also pointed to worry over an economic and humanitarian crisis in motion since the Taliban takeover, as aid dried up and sanctions were imposed.\nFarmer Rahatullah Azizi told AFP he used to earn a living off his crops but now has \u201cjust enough to eat\u201d.\nHe expressed relief, however, that the security situation was better, noting he could now travel freely at night without fear of being mugged.\nBut while violence has fallen across Afghanistan in the past two years, the Islamic State group remains a threat and tensions have risen with Pakistan over an increase of attacks in the countries\u2019 shared border areas.\nThe Taliban authorities have pledged that Afghan territory won\u2019t be used by foreign militants to stage attacks abroad but it remains a sticking point.\nWhile some Afghans celebrate the end of fighting and Taliban rule, others see Aug 15 as a grim reminder.\n\u201cAll the girls and women of Afghanistan want their freedom back,\u201d said former student Hamasah Bawar ahead of the anniversary.
