A student might have three years of postgraduate study but will only be in class for a half a year,\u201d said Mr Wang Ziyang, a recent graduate who blogs about chip hiring trends on LinkedIn-esque social network Maimai, where he has over 90,000 followers.\nThere are some steps in this direction in China. Its largest chip foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), in 2021 announced a jointly-established School of Integrated Circuits at Shenzhen Technology University.\nEngineering bootcamps\nMaster\u2019s enrolments to study chip engineering at 10 top universities nearly doubled between 2018 and 2022 to a total of 2,893 students, according to university data.\nThe jump in students is being mirrored at the undergraduate level, fresh graduates told Reuters, but solving the shortage will be a long-term campaign.\nUnderlining the supply-demand imbalance, the average annual salary for an entry-level engineer in the sector has doubled since 2018, from roughly 200,000 yuan (S$38,600) to 400,000 yuan, according to Mr Hu Yunwang, founder of a Shanghai-based recruitment agency for chips.\nA number of private schools have sprung up to offer a short-term solution, with chip engineering bootcamps that purport to provide a fast track and mainly target graduates who majored in a subject tangentially related to chip engineering.\nEeeKnow, founded by a former engineer from Arm Ltd in Shanghai in 2015, offers in-person classes on subjects such as \u201cCortex-M3 MCU front-end design and verification in 60 days\u201d, priced at between 2,000 and 4,000 yuan.\nMr Abner Zheng, who graduated in 2019 from a university in Chengdu with a materials science degree, said he signed up for courses at EeeKnow after reading a blog post suggesting students with his major pursue opportunities in chips. He now works at a Chinese company making image-processing chips.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t switch to chip engineering, I would probably have to find a job in a traditional manufacturing industry like cars or machinery,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI feel like these are sunset industries, so I\u2019ve decided I should take advantage this big wave that\u2019s coming for chips.\u201d REUTERS"}
