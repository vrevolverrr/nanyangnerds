Increased GST\nThe goods and services tax will be increased for the first time in more than a decade, by 2 percentage points.\nLast year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said raising taxes was \"not a matter of whether, but a matter of when\", sparking speculation among economists and tax specialists about the type of increase and when it would kick in.\nThe increased GST will be implemented sometime from 2021 to 2025. Mr Heng said he expected that the Government would \"need to do so earlier rather than later\".\nThe timing of the raised GST will depend on the state of the economy, how much expenditures grow, and how buoyant existing taxes are, said Mr Heng.\n2. GST to be imposed on digital imported services\nAre you a keen user of streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify?\nFrom Jan 1, 2020, such services from overseas suppliers will be taxed, even if they do not have a physical presence in Singapore.\nOther examples of imported services include apps, listing fees on electronic marketplaces, software, and online subscription fees.\nThe GST will also cover imported services for businesses here, such as marketing, accounting, IT and management services.\nHowever, the move will not affect e-commerce for goods, despite speculations by observers earlier.\n3. One-off SG Bonus for all Singaporeans\nIf you are 21 years old and above, you will receive a one-off \"hongbao\" of up to $300 this year.\nSingaporeans who earn more than $100,000 a year or who own more than one property will receive $100.\nThe bonus, which will cost the Government $700 million, comes from this year's Budget surplus of $9.6 billion.\n4. Enhanced Proximity Housing Grant\nFamilies buying a resale flat to live with their parents or children will now receive an increased grant of $30,000, compared to $20,000 previously.\nThe grant amount for families buying a resale flat to live near their parents or children will remain at $20,000.\nThe grant will also be increased for singles. Those who buy a resale flat to live with their parents will receive a $15,000 grant, compared to $10,000 previously.\nSingles who buy a resale flat near their parents will also receive a grant of $10,000.\nThe criterion for determining what is \"near\" will also be revised to within 4km, instead of the current 2km.\n5. Buyer's Stamp Duty rates for residential properties to increase\nIn a surprise announcement, Mr Heng said the top marginal Buyer's Stamp Duty (BSD) will increase from 3 per cent to 4 per cent.\nThe new top marginal rate will apply to the portion of residential property value which is in excess of $1 million.\nThe change will apply to all residential properties acquired from Tuesday (Feb 20), he added.\nRates for non-residential properties remain unchanged at 1 per cent to 3 per cent.\nWhile the levy concession of $60 for households with children below 16 years old, seniors or persons with disabilities will remain the same, the qualifying age for seniors will be raised from 65 to 67 years old.\nHowever, households that currently enjoy the levy concession under the aged person scheme will continue to do so even after the new framework kicks in on April 1 next year.\n8. Additional Utilities-Save\nTo cover the impact of the new carbon tax on households, the Government will be increasing the amount of Utilities-Save (U-Save) under the GST voucher for three years.\nFrom 2019 to 2021, households will receive $20 more in their annual U-Save.\nThis will help to cover the annual impact of the carbon tax, which is estimated to result in up to an average of $13.70 in additional electricity and gas expenses.\nHouseholds are expected to use the three-year period to adjust to the new carbon tax, and take efforts to reduce their electricity and gas consumption.\n9. Service and Conservancy Charges rebate\nThe service and conservancy charges rebate will be extended for another year for eligible Housing Board households.\nThe rates remain the same as last year.\nHouseholds that live in one- and two-room flats will receive 3.5 months of S&CC rebate, while those in three- and four-room flats will receive 2.5 months of rebate.\nHouseholds living in five-room flats will receive two months of rebate, while those living in executive or multi-generation flats will receive 1.5 months of rebate."}
