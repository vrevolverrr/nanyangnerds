Mr Wang is in the US for the United Nations General Assembly session.\nChina this week urged the US to \u201cpromptly\u201d remove all additional tariffs on Chinese goods.\nWashington has expressed concern over China\u2019s ties with Russia since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while Beijing has repeatedly expressed worries over US ties with Taiwan.\nThe US is Taiwan\u2019s most important international backer and arms supplier even though Washington does not formally recognise its government, maintaining official relations only with Beijing.\nThe challenges to the US posed by China exceed those of the Cold War, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said earlier in September.\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration has been explicit that it is not seeking a cold war with China, but increasingly, analysts and members of the US Congress have said escalating global competition between the two superpowers resembled a new style of the Cold War.\nThe two sides have kept lines of communication open in recent months. The White House said in August a call was being planned between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Biden soon. REUTERS"}
