Based on this, and a 12-month trailing DPU of 16.042 euro cents, the counter trades at an estimated 38 per cent discount to its net asset value with an 11.5 per cent trailing distribution yield.\nMr Garing acknowledged that such levels create \u201can impression of substantial valuation declines and significant reductions in distributions from the impact of transitioning to higher interest rates\u201d.\n\u201cIn addition to being 91 per cent-hedged for the next two years, the bond buyback should provide investors additional confidence in our capital management strategies and allow Cromwell E-Reit to be well-placed for when the interest rate and real estate cycles turn.\u201d\nCromwell E-Reit\u2019s move comes ahead of an expected 100 basis point rate cut by the European Central Bank in 2024, as currently implied by European credit markets.\nConsidering this, Mr Garing said he believes listed Reits are close to an inflection point as Europe\u2019s property market occupancy fundamentals remained \u201cvery healthy\u201d."}
