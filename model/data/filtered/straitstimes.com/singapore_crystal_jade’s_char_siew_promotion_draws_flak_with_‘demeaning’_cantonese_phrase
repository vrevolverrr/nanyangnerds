Bad advertising!\u201d\nBut for some, the campaign had hit the mark. Instagram user jon.k.12345 said: \u201cIt\u2019s super funny. Cantonese families say this all the time, and it doesn\u2019t mean they love their kids any less!\u201d\nIn response to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesperson for the Chinese restaurant chain said on June 4 that the campaign was meant to connect with its Cantonese-speaking audience in a \u201crelatable and humorous manner\u201d.\n\u201cOur intention was to bring a touch of light-heartedness to the Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s Day weekends with this campaign that references a common Cantonese saying parents use to express exasperation over their children.\n\u201cHowever, we understand that humour can be subjective, and regret that this particular reference missed the mark and has caused unhappiness among some customers.\u201d\nCrystal Jade will not be halting the promotion, said the spokesperson, adding that it will continue on June 8, 9, 15 and 16.\nDespite the backlash, the \u201cprovocative\u201d campaign has succeeded in garnering the public\u2019s attention, said marketing experts.\n\u201cInteresting and memorable ideas are likely to ruffle feathers, and if they do, it typically means they\u2019ve worked,\u201d said Mr Nafe Tong, chief creative officer of brand and creative consulting agency ABrandADay.\n\u201cThe out-of-the-box idea may have come across as \u2018demeaning\u2019 or \u2018rude\u2019, but in fact highlights a humorous part of Cantonese culture that many would\u2019ve experienced growing up and may still be using in their lexicon today,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThe saying would have lost its nuance and not have been as amusing had it been translated into English.\u201d\nChief executive of digital marketing agency MediaOne Tom Koh said Cantonese sayings resonate deeply with Singaporeans who speak the dialect, creating a strong cultural connection and making the campaign relatable and engaging.\n\u201cHowever, more modern and Westernised families might perceive such expressions as aggressive or insulting, leading to potential backlash. Non-Cantonese speakers might not grasp the humour or cultural significance, potentially leading to confusion or misinterpretation,\u201d he added.\nThe campaign might have been effective in attracting fans and customers, said Mr Koh. He pointed out that as at the evening of June 4, Crystal Jade\u2019s Instagram post had accumulated about 770 likes, a number much higher than the usual range of between 30 and 70 likes.\nThe engagement, he said, proves the famous adage that many brands are driven by: Bad publicity is better than no publicity.\nThe council of the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (Asas) noted that while the campaign is intended to be \u201clight-hearted\u201d, it is not in line with the general principle of Singapore\u2019s advertising code on family values.\nAsas chairman Ang Peng Hwa said that as advertisements are public-facing, they should not \u201cencourage inconsiderate and disrespectful conduct\u201d or \u201cdiscredit mutual love, affection and support\u201d among family members."}
