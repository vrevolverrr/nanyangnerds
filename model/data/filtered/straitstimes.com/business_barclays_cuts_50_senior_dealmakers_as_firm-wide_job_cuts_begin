This amounts to about 3 per cent of total headcount in the unit, which also includes Barclays\u2019 trading operations.\nA spokesperson for Barclays declined to comment.\nBarclays and its rivals have been contending with a prolonged slump in dealmaking and capital markets activity as corporate chiefs remain on the sidelines amid higher interest rates around the world. For its part, Barclays\u2019 investment banking fees dropped 15 per cent in the second quarter.\nWall Street firms routinely conduct annual cuts based on performance to maintain their competitiveness and adjust businesses to shifting markets.\nGoldman Sachs Group has been planning to begin its annual cut of underperforming workers. Citigroup has also dismissed hundreds of people across both its investment banking and trading divisions in 2023, including dozens of workers in September.\n\u201cWe always continually modulate and modify that workforce,\u201d Barclays chief executive officer C.S. Venkatakrishnan said. \u201cWhat you see at Barclays is no different from what you see anywhere else.\u201d\nThe company has been investing in the banking division after naming two new global co-heads of the business earlier in 2023. As part of that, Barclays has also hired more than 30 managing directors and directors for the unit. BLOOMBERG"}
