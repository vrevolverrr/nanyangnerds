Portions of the waterway, where US$3 trillion (S$3.9 trillion) worth of trade passes annually, are believed to be rich in oil and natural gas deposits, as well as fish stocks.\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 found China\u2019s sweeping claims had no legal basis, a ruling Beijing rejects.\nMr Liu Dejun, a spokesman for China\u2019s coast guard, called on the Philippines in a statement to withdraw immediately from the shoal.\n\u201cThe Chinese coast guard will take the measures required to resolutely thwart all acts of provocation, nuisance and infringement and resolutely safeguard the country\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,\u201d Mr Liu said.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard\u2019s spokesman, Commodore Jay Tarriela, told reporters the China Coast Guard ignored collision regulations and carried out dangerous manoeuvres, resulting in damage but that no injuries were reported.\nSabina Shoal is located 140km west of the Philippine island of Palawan and about 1,200km from Hainan island, the nearest major Chinese landmass.\nPhilippine and Chinese vessels have collided at least twice in August near Sabina, which analysts say Beijing is seeking to further encroach upon, moving deeper into Manila\u2019s exclusive economic zone and normalising Chinese control of the area.\nThe discovery of piles of crushed coral at the shoal ignited suspicion in Manila that Beijing was planning to build another permanent base there, which would be its closest outpost to the Philippine archipelago.\nRecent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have also taken place around Second Thomas Shoal.\nA Filipino sailor lost a thumb in a clash there in June when Chinese coast guard members wielding knives, sticks and an axe foiled a Philippine Navy attempt to resupply a small garrison.\nSabina Shoal is also the rendezvous point for Philippine resupply missions to the garrison on Second Thomas Shoal.\nThe repeated confrontations prompted Manila to brand Beijing the \u201cbiggest disruptor\u201d to peace in South-east Asia at a defence conference in August.
