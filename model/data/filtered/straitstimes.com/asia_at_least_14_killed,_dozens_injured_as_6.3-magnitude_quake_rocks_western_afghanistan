Suddenly, the building started shaking, and wall plasters started to fall down, and the walls got cracks. Some walls and parts of the building collapsed,\u201d 45-year-old Bashir Ahmad told AFP.\n\u201cI am not able to contact my family. Network connections are disconnected. I am too worried and scared. It was horrifying,\u201d he said.\nCrowds of women and children stood out in the wide streets of Herat, away from tall buildings, in the moments after the first quake and aftershocks which continued for roughly one hour.\nPublic health director of Herat province Mohammad Taleb Shahid told AFP 14 people were killed and 78 injured, but said he feared the tally would rise.\n\u201cThese are the numbers that have been brought to the central hospital so far, but this is not the final figure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have information that people are buried under rubble.\u201d\nHundreds of fatalities were possible, according to a USGS preliminary report.\n\u201cSignificant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response,\u201d it said.\nUSGS earlier reported the first quake\u2019s magnitude as 6.2. It had a shallow depth of just 14km, it said.\nHerat \u2013 120km east of the border with Iran \u2013 is considered the cultural capital of Afghanistan.\nIt is the capital of Herat province, which is home to an estimated population of 1.9 million, according to 2019 World Bank data.\nIn June 2022, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands made homeless after a 5.9-magnitude quake \u2013 the deadliest in Afghanistan in nearly a quarter of a century \u2013 struck the impoverished province of Paktika.\nIn March 2023, 13 people were killed in Afghanistan and Pakistan by a 6.5-magnitude quake, which hit near Jurm in north-eastern Afghanistan.\nAfghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, which lies near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.\nAfghanistan is already in the grip of a grinding humanitarian crisis, with the widespread withdrawal of foreign aid since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
