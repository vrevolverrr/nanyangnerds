It did not elaborate on the circumstances of their killing, or from where in Gaza they were recovered.\nIsraeli media reported that Toledano was taken by Hamas from an outdoor music festival that had turned into a massacre.\nIsrael said 240 people were taken hostage when Hamas gunmen breached the separation barrier into Israel on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people.\nPalestinian authorities say Israel's intense bombardment and ground operation in Gaza in the weeks since have killed nearly 19,000 Palestinians, wounded tens of thousands more and displaced half of the strip's 2.3 million population.\nDuring a week-long truce in late November, Hamas released more than 100 women, children and foreigners it was holding in Gaza in exchange for the release of 240 women and teenagers Israel had imprisoned, many without charge.\nMore than 130 hostages remain in Gaza. Some have been declared dead in absentia by Israeli authorities.\nThe Palestinian Prisoners Association said Israel has detained more than 4,400 Palestinians since Oct. 7 and is holding around half without charge.
