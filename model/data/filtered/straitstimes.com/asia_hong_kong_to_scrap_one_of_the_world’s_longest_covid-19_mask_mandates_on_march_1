It is a clear message to show Hong Kong is resuming normalcy,\u201d Mr Lee said.\nIn high-risk places such as hospitals, administrators can decide whether to require staff and visitors to wear masks, he added.\nNeighbouring special administrative region Macau said on Sunday that it would drop pandemic-related mask requirements for most locations, except when using public transportation, and visiting hospitals and a handful of other areas.\nIn mainland China, residents are not required to wear masks outdoors, although the authorities encourage them to do so in public indoor areas such as airports and train stations.\nHong Kong\u2019s move to scrap masks comes after its government in February launched a promotional campaign called \u201cHello Hong Kong\u201d to bring back tourists and businesses that have steered clear of the former British colony since 2020.\nThe city had stuck rigidly to its mask rule, even in schools where children as young as two years old were mandated to wear them outside their homes.\nMany students and teachers have been concerned about the impact on learning and child development."}
