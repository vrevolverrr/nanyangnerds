OpenAI decided against a wider roll-out of the feature, which it briefed reporters on earlier in March.\nA spokesperson for OpenAI said the company decided to scale back the release after receiving feedback from stakeholders such as policymakers, industry experts, educators and creatives. The company had initially planned to release the tool to as many as 100 developers through an application process, according to the earlier press briefing.\n\u201cWe recognise that generating speech that resembles people\u2019s voices has serious risks, which are especially top of mind in an election year,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post on March 29. \u201cWe are engaging with US and international partners from across government, media, entertainment, education, civil society and beyond to ensure we are incorporating their feedback as we build.\u201d\nOther AI technology has already been used to fake voices in some contexts. In January, a bogus but realistic-sounding phone call purporting to be from United States President Joe Biden encouraged people in New Hampshire not to vote in the primaries \u2013 an event that stoked AI fears ahead of critical global elections.\nUnlike OpenAI\u2019s previous efforts at generating audio content, Voice Engine can create speech that sounds like individual people, complete with their specific cadence and intonations. All the software needs is 15 seconds of recorded audio of a person speaking to recreate their voice.\nDuring a demonstration of the tool, Bloomberg listened to a clip of OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman briefly explaining the technology in a voice that sounded indistinguishable from his actual speech, but was entirely AI-generated.\n\u201cIf you have the right audio set-up, it\u2019s basically a human-calibre voice,\u201d said Mr Jeff Harris, a product lead at OpenAI. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty impressive technical quality.\u201d However, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s obviously a lot of safety delicacy around the ability to really accurately mimic human speech\u201d.\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s current developer partners using the tool, the Norman Prince Neurosciences Institute at the not-for-profit health system Lifespan, is using the technology to help patients recover their voice. For example, the tool was used to restore the voice of a young patient who lost her ability to speak clearly due to a brain tumour by replicating her speech from an earlier recording for a school project, the company blog post said.\nOpenAI\u2019s custom speech model can also translate the audio it generates into different languages. That makes it useful for companies in the audio business, like Spotify Technology. Spotify has already used the technology in its own pilot programme to translate the podcasts of popular hosts like Lex Fridman. OpenAI also touted other beneficial applications of the technology, such as creating a wider range of voices for educational content for children.\nIn the testing programme, OpenAI is requiring its partners to agree to its usage policies, obtain consent from the original speaker before using their voice, and disclose to listeners that the voices they are hearing are AI-generated. The company is also installing an inaudible audio watermark to allow it to distinguish whether a piece of audio was created by its tool.\nBefore deciding whether to release the feature more broadly, OpenAI said it is soliciting feedback from outside experts. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people around the world understand where this technology is headed, whether we ultimately deploy it widely ourselves or not,\u201d the company said in the blog post.\nOpenAI also wrote that it hopes the preview of its software \u201cmotivates the need to bolster societal resilience\u201d against the challenges brought about by more advanced AI technologies.\nFor example, the company called on banks to phase out voice authentication as a security measure for accessing bank accounts and sensitive information.\nIt is also seeking public education about deceptive AI content and more development of techniques for detecting whether audio content is real or AI-generated.
