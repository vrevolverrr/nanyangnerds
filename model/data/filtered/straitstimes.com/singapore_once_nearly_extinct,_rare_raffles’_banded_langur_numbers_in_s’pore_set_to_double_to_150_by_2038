She said it remains one of the most threatened primates in the world.\nDespite the optimistic projections in the latest study, the researchers said even a small uptick in deaths can be damaging for the population of Raffles\u2019 banded langurs in Singapore.\nIn the statement, Ms Amy Woolloff, the lead author of the paper, said: \u201cAlthough our model shows the population is likely to continue growing in the next 50 years, they remain vulnerable to not only deaths from roadkill, but also unpredictable events such as diseases and extreme weather.\u201d\nBetween 2017 and 2023, four langurs or about 5 per cent of the total population in Singapore, died in road accidents.\nMs Woolloff said: \u201cTo ensure the long-term survival of this species in Singapore, there remains an urgent need to identify more suitable habitats for the Raffles\u2019 banded langurs, to enhance habitat connectivity to prevent deaths occurring from road crossings, and to increase population genetic diversity with conservation translocation\u201d.\nResearchers found that the loss of unprotected habitat is the greatest threat now, while the most effective short-term management strategy was to improve links between patches of forest areas in their current range.\nSpeaking to The Straits Times, Dr Ang said one high priority site is the forest opposite Thomson Nature Park, close to the spot where two Raffles\u2019 banded langurs were killed on the Seletar Expressway in late 2022.\nThe site is slated for residential development, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority\u2019s 2019 masterplan.\nMr Lim Liang Jim, who is the National Parks Board (NParks) group director of conservation, said the board has been taking steps to protect and shore up key habitats for the langur.\nThese include planting trees that have spreading canopies, and installing rope bridges to allow the animals to cross safely.\nMr Lim said: \u201cIn assessing where to situate the rope bridges, NParks worked closely with the Raffles\u2019 Banded Langur Working Group to locate them where the langurs have been observed to habitually cross. NParks will continue to work with the community to come up with strategies to strengthen the survival of our native langurs and other wildlife.\u201d\nThe Raffles\u2019 Banded Langur Working Group is managed and funded by Mandai Nature, and its members include representatives from NParks, Singapore universities, nature groups, agencies from Malaysia and the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore)."}
