Paying in roubles was getting harder.\nTwo weeks into the conflict, Mr Ladau decided that Paulig would leave and two months later, it did what usually takes as long as a year - find a suitable buyer and seal a deal. In May, Paulig sold its Russian business to private Indian investor Vikas Soi.\nMore than a thousand Western companies have joined a corporate exodus from Russia - unprecedented in its scale and speed - as they scramble to comply with sanctions and amid threats of retaliation from the Kremlin.\nBut Paulig is one of a relatively small number of firms that have sold assets or handed over the keys to local managers. A Reuters tally shows fewer than 40, including McDonald's, Societe Generale (SocGen) and Renault, have announced deals.\nInterviews with half a dozen executives at companies that have divested assets show the complexity and uncertainty of selling at speed and hefty discounts - and why it may be taking many so long.\nThe obstacles are huge. Confusion has swirled over what the Kremlin would allow foreign companies to do; employees are nervous after government threats of retaliation; sanctions have limited the pool of buyers and there is little time to check them out; sale prices have been steeply discounted; and negotiations are being done virtually because fears of reprisals make it too risky to visit Russia in person.\nWith Moscow preparing a new law that is expected to come into force soon, allowing it to take control of the local businesses of Western companies that decide to leave, the stakes are getting higher.\n\"If you have not started the process already or if you still have doubts about it, then it is going to get harder,\" Mr Ladau told Reuters, speaking before Mr Putin's swoop on the Sakhalin oil and gas project.\n\"Russia has no interest in letting foreign companies out of the market easily.\"\nMany have given the keys to local managers. Almost all have booked hefty write-downs totalling tens of billions of dollars.\nMr Ladau decided against a buy-back clause.\n\"The moral-ethical issues are so serious that we have no room to return to Russia,\" he said.\nExperts say it will be tough for new owners in an increasingly isolated Russia without access to Western goods. The cost of everything from food to energy is soaring and the economy has plunged into recession.\nStill, the departures have provided an unexpected windfall to firms and entrepreneurs in Russia and countries outside of sanctions as they snap up prized assets for a bargain.\nNo bankers\nOne aspect of the exodus highlights its unusual nature: the absence of bankers who would normally play a key role in deals.\nSources say banks have steered clear due to concerns about breaking sanctions.\nInstead, companies are relying on lawyers in Russia and international consultants with knowledge of the country to find and vet suitors - making sure they are legitimate, not on sanctions lists and have the financial credentials."}
