That he will get through this,\u201d she said.\nNow that he has been moved to the harsher cell, she will only be allowed \u201cshort (visits), once or twice a year\u201d.\nVladimir Kara-Murza, a dual Russian and UK national serving 25 years on treason charges, has also been moved to the PKT cell in his Siberian prison.\nHis exiled lawyer, Mr Vadim Prokhorov, said on Facebook on June 19 that the prison administration had decided to place Kara-Murza there for \u201csix months\u201d.\nHe said the \u201cformal reason\u201d for the decision was that he \u201cfor a few seconds held his hand not behind his back.\u201d\nIn the months before his death, Navalny was in and out of isolation cells.
