The airspace for the training area is more than 20 times the size of Singapore.\nAbout 1,100 people from the SAF and defence technology community are involved.\nAs part of the exercise, a new unmanned ground vehicle, as well as drones that can function autonomously are making their debut, alongside 10 F-16 fighter jets, some of which have been upgraded.\nFor the first time, the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft will showcase its automatic air-to-air refuelling capabilities when it comes to extending the endurance of fighter jets.\nOther assets involved include 12 of the Republic of Singapore Air Force\u2019s F-15SG fighters, three Heron 1 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), six High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, as well as four AH-64D Apache helicopters.\nThese are joined by commando lasing and strike observers missions teams, who provide intelligence on targets from the ground.\nThe exercise has three aims, said the exercise director for air, Brigadier-General Lim Kok Hong, including bringing the SAF\u2019s four services together to \u201csense-make, decide and direct operations\u201d, which allows them to hash out processes for the force to operate as a singular entity.\nThe 47-year-old said it also aims to develop smarter warfighting systems, as well as function as a test bed for experimentation.\n\u201cToday, conflicts are a lot more uncertain, and it is a lot more challenging to find the targets and prosecute them.\n\u201cSo we test the end-to-end process to allow people to identify the target, sense-make, quickly pass the information accurately to the shooter so that they can strike the target,\u201d said BG Lim.\n\u201cThis entire cycle is exercised over and over again with different scenarios so that we make sure we are ready for such uncertainties.\u201d"}
