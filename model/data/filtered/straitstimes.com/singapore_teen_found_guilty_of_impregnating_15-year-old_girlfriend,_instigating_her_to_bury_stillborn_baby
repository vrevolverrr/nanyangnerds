The boy then bought a pregnancy test kit online for her.\nAfter finding out about the pregnancy, the couple tried to abort the foetus on their own, but their various attempts failed.\nOn June 10, 2021, the girl experienced labour pains and gave birth to their stillborn son alone in her bedroom, with her boyfriend on video call.\nShe cut the umbilical cord with a pair of scissors. The accused then told her to cut the placenta into small pieces, flush them away and bury the body.\nThe girl wrapped the body in newspaper and hid it in her cabinet, but her boyfriend told her that it was inappropriate and risky to keep it in the house.\nTwo days later, she buried the body in the garden of her home and would sit there to grieve from time to time.\nThe couple ended their relationship in March 2022.\nA month later, the girl\u2019s mother found that she was exceptionally quiet and asked if anything was wrong.\nThe girl told her mother what happened and made a police report.\nDPP Gan said he does not object to the calling of either a probation suitability report or a reformative training report for the accused.\nDefence lawyer Choo Si Sen urged the court to assess his client\u2019s suitability for reformative training only if he is found unsuitable for probation.\nHe added that his client would begin his national service in January.\nReformative training is a more severe punishment than probation and results in a criminal record. It involves being detained in a reformative training centre for six to 12 months to attend rehabilitative programmes and counselling.\nA probation order may include attending the programmes recommended by a probation officer and abiding by a curfew.\nIn his written mitigation plea, Mr Choo said his client committed the offences because of his immature age and on the spur of the moment.\nHe added that the teen achieved good academic results and wants to move on with his life."}
