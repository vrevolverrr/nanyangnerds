So through HT Cares, we help them deal with the issues that could have led to the violence.\"\nThe scheme, which was first piloted in Bedok Police Division in January 2019, has engaged more than 300 offenders.\nThe task force also recommended setting up a 24-hour emergency social service response for family violence cases.\nNow, an emergency social service response team from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) responds during after office hours but only to cases of child abuse or vulnerable adult abuse, such as that of elderly family members.\nThe response team will then try to de-escalate tensions and put together an immediate safety plan, such as requiring an adult, for instance, a grandparent, to be present in the household in the case of child abuse or requiring the vulnerable adult to temporarily move to a relative's home.\nFamilies are later referred to agencies, including family service centres and family violence specialist centres, for intervention like counselling or treatment to address the issues related to the violence.\nDuring a press briefing on Wednesday, Minister of State for Social and Family Development and Education Sun Xueling said the enhanced emergency response will require \"close collaboration between social workers and police enforcement officers\".\nWhere a clear grievous offence has occurred and it is arrestable, the police will take action, she said.\nThe Government is considering time-limited protection notices in high-risk cases to protect victims and keep them temporarily separated from the perpetrators, Ms Sun said.\nFor example, these temporary protection notices can help protect the victims while they take further action, such as applying for a personal protection order (PPO) to ensure their own safety in the long term.\nThe task force report also recommended expanding the National Anti-Violence Helpline scheme to include Internet live chats or mobile and messaging applications to make it accessible to victims who may not be able to call for help.\nThe 24-hour helpline received 5,300 calls on family violence between its launch at the start of the year and Aug 31.\nMSF said the second phase of the helpline scheme, which may include other channels like mobile apps, will be ready by the second half of 2022.\nThe Government is also considering giving more teeth to laws ensuring protection for victims, such as harsher penalties for the breach of a PPO and empowering the authorities to apply for PPOs for family violence victims as a third party.\nA PPO is a court order restraining a person from committing violence against a family member.\nGiven that the penalties for breaching a PPO have not changed since 1996, the task force recommended that these be brought in line with penalties for breach of the Protection from Harassment Act (Poha).\nUnder the current law, those who breach a PPO may be fined $2,000 or jailed for up to six months if the order does not relate to a vulnerable adult.\nThose who breach an order under Poha against an intimate partner may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to 12 months, or both.\nThe task force also suggested amending the Women's Charter to introduce new types of orders to ensure victims' safety. These include orders prohibiting the perpetrator from visiting or communicating with the victim or entering an area outside the victim's residence.\nA total of 312 PPOs were granted between June and August last year right after the circuit breaker period, up from the 229 PPOs issued from January to March 2020.\nUnder the proposed recommendations, the director-general of social welfare and appointed protectors, such as specially appointed staff from MSF, can apply for PPOs for victims of family violence even without their consent in high-risk circumstances, if they do not file one themselves due to fear or undue influence of the perpetrator.\nDr Sudha Nair, executive director of the Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence, said this recommendation was useful when engaging victims whose lives were at risk.\nShe said: \"I think one of the major issues that we see with a small number of families is where you have situations of Stockholm syndrome, where the victim is not in a position to make decisions because of the undue influence of the perpetrator.\"\nStockholm syndrome refers to an emotional response that happens to some abuse victims when they have positive feelings or sympathy towards an abuser.\n\"In a situation like that, we would want to ensure the person's life and therefore, that would be an instance where this kind of PPO would be very useful,\" Dr Nair added.\nHowever, the task force added that third-party PPO applications should be made only in exceptional situations where the survivor's safety is seriously threatened."}
