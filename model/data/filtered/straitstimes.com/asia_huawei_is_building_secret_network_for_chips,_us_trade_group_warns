The company denies being a security risk.\nIf Huawei is constructing facilities under the names of other companies as the Semiconductor Industry Association says, then it might be able to circumvent US government restrictions to indirectly purchase American chipmaking equipment, according to the Bloomberg report.\nHuawei and the Semiconductor Industry Association did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.\nHuawei has been placed on a trade blacklist in the United States, restricting most suppliers from shipping goods and technology to the company unless they are granted licences. Officials have continued to tighten controls to cut off the company\u2019s ability to buy or design the semiconductor chips that power most of its products. REUTERS"}
