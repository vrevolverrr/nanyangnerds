Among the most-cited concerns are its possible use as spyware by the Chinese government, misinformation and its social impact on young people.\nAs at June, federal employees and state employees in 34 out of 50 states were prohibited from using it on government devices.\nBut in some cases, the courts have stalled these efforts. On Nov 30, a federal judge blocked a law in Montana that sought to ban TikTok across the state from Jan 1, 2024, saying the ban \u201coversteps state power\u201d.\nUS District Judge Donald Molloy said there was also \u201clittle doubt that Montana\u2019s legislature and Attorney-General were more interested in targeting China\u2019s ostensible role in TikTok than with protecting consumers in Montana\u201d.\nA day earlier, a judge in Indiana similarly rejected an attempt by the state to ban TikTok on grounds that it constitutes a \u201cmalicious and menacing threat unleashed on unsuspecting Indiana consumers by a Chinese company that knows full well the harms it inflicts on users\u201d.\nMeanwhile, politicians are facing a deepening dilemma ahead of the presidential election in 2024. Given that more young voters are turning to the app not just for entertainment but also for news, should they, too, be on it even if they may loathe it?\nOne contender for the White House, the fast-talking millennial Vivek Ramsawamy, 38, a wild card for the Republican nomination, has embraced it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this to reach young people, to energise young people, and to do that, we can\u2019t just hide,\u201d he said in his first post in September. \u201cYou can\u2019t play in the game, and then not play in the game.\u201d\nBut since June, US government agencies and employees have been prohibited from being on the platform, and that could well be hampering President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to get his messaging, especially on the economy, out to a cohort that traditionally leans towards Democrats \u2013 young voters.\nThe presumptive Republican nominee, former president Donald Trump, is also not on TikTok. But the right wing, analysts say, is finding fertile ground on the anarchical platform where conspiracy competes with fact.\n\u201cThere is plenty of research that shows that people who lean right politically are drawn more frequently to misinformation and to news sources that traffic in misinformation,\u201d says Mr Paul Barrett, adjunct professor at New York University\u2019s School of Law and deputy director at its Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights.\nThe Biden administration has handcuffed itself, the adjunct professor said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that... teenagers and people in their early 20s prefer TikTok over the older, more familiar platforms, and there\u2019s no doubt that political forces of all sorts have discovered TikTok as a medium,\u201d he told The Straits Times.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the election is going to turn on who can perform best on TikTok, but at the margin with a crucial segment of the electorate, which is to say younger voters, it could be a factor.\u201d\nVoters between the ages of 18 and 24 are estimated to comprise about 28 per cent of the electorate \u2013 and achieving turnout is always a challenge.\nCertainly, the bans do not prevent political messaging through influencers like Mr Harry Sisson, who filmed a TikTok video in November 2022 with former president Barack Obama. Mr Sisson, who goes by the TikTok handle harryjsisson, has 746,800 followers and a cumulative 87.5 million \u201clikes\u201d.\nBut how the platform may influence voting behaviour is a question in search of an answer, partly because the social impact of video messaging is much harder to measure than that of text.\nIts effect, though, was dramatically illustrated in November when a long-forgotten \u201cLetter to America\u201d by Osama bin Laden \u2013 the mastermind behind the Sept 11, 2001, attacks that killed 2,977 people \u2013 surfaced on the platform and, according to researchers, garnered more than 6.9 million views. It subsequently went viral on other platforms as well.\nThe letter stated, among other things, that the Sept 11 attacks were blowback for America\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine territory.\nOsama was killed by US forces in an operation in Pakistan in 2011.\nAlso in November, Pew Research said its polling showed that a small but growing share of US adults regularly get news on TikTok.\n\u201cIn just three years, the share of US adults who say they regularly get news from TikTok has more than quadrupled, from 3 per cent in 2020 to 14 per cent in 2023,\u201d Pew Research said on Nov 15.\nA separate NBC News poll reported on Nov 22 found that one in five voters uses the app at least once a day \u2013 and that a higher share of young voters say they regularly use TikTok.\nThis has triggered more scrutiny for the app, whose Singaporean chief executive Chew Shou Zi was cross-questioned for more than four hours in Congress in March.\nThe US House China Select Committee chairman Mike Gallagher has labelled the app \u201cdigital fentanyl\u201d, referring to its addictive qualities.\nIn his opening remarks at a Nov 30 hearing in Congress on China\u2019s strategy to shape the global information space, the Republican from Wisconsin said: \u201cIn the best-case scenario, TikTok is CCP (Chinese Communist Party) spyware... In the worst-case scenario, TikTok is perhaps the largest-scale malign influence operation ever conducted.\u201d\nDr Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, who focuses on domestic and transnational terrorism, international security and geopolitics, told ST the Osama letter going viral on TikTok was fundamentally a failure of the US education system.\n\u201cThe US authorities have mostly been focused on the impact of radicalisation, but what we saw with the bin Laden letter, although less dangerous, is potentially more corrosive over the long term,\u201d Dr Clarke wrote in an e-mail.\n\u201cMoreover, there is no bipartisan agreement for what to do about TikTok, and politicians seem concerned about restricting the app during an election year, for fear of alienating Gen Z and younger demographics that are now of voting age or will be soon.\u201d\nTikTok is \u201cvery sinister\u201d, said war historian and strategist Edward Luttwak, who views the app as a Trojan horse. Congressman Gallagher understands this, he said.\n\u201cThe remedy here is not to use TikTok,\u201d Dr Luttwak told ST. \u201cThe remedy is to shut it down as a Chinese-operated political warfare machine.\u201d\nBut attempts to shut it down have also met with resistance from an army of powerful lobbyists, he noted.\nIn July, the journal Open Secrets, which follows money trails, reported that after ByteDance spent a record US$5.3 million (S$7.1 million) on federal lobbying in 2022, it poured another US$4.28 million into federal lobbying during the first half of 2023.\nIn total, ByteDance has spent more than US$17.7 million on lobbying since it first reported payments to federal lobbyists in 2019.\nFormer members of Congress are among the lobbyists; they include former senators Trent Lott of Mississippi and John Breaux of Louisiana, as well as former congressmen Jeff Denham of California and Bart Gordon of Tennessee.\nConcerns over TikTok handing user data to China have been partially addressed by ByteDance \u2013 though lawmakers are not convinced."}
