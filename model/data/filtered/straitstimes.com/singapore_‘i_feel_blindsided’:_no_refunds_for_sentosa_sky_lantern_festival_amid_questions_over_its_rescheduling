I thought the event would be reliable because it was publicised on multiple news sites, and it was hosted on Sentosa.\u201d\nChecks by ST found that Ms Bautista\u2019s phone number is linked to a cancelled sky lantern festival in Dubai that was meant to take place in 2023. The event, which appeared to have been postponed due to last-minute issues, had also hawked tickets for about $50 each."}
