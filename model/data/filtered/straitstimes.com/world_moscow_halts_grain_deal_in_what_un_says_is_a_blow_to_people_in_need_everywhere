They said that they are ready, if Ukraine lets them go, and Turkey continues to let them through, then everyone is ready to continue supplying grain.\u201d\nRussian offensive\nKyiv has been striking Russian supply lines as it pursues a counteroffensive to drive Russian forces out of its south and east. On Monday it reported two more civilians killed by Russian forces, which it said had begun a major push in the northeast.\n\u201cFor two days running, the enemy has been actively on the offensive in the Kupiansk sector in Kharkiv region. We are defending. Heavy fighting is going on and the positions of both sides change dynamically several times a day,\u201d Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar, wrote on Telegram.\nThe armed forces said Russia had amassed a huge array of forces.\n\u201cIn the Lyman-Kupiansk sector the enemy has concentrated a very powerful grouping. More than 100,000 personnel, more than 900 tanks, more than 555 artillery systems, and 370 multiple launch rocket systems,\u201d Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Armed Forces East group, said on national TV.\nReuters was not able to verify the accounts and there was no immediate comment from Russia.\nUkrainian ground forces Commander General Oleksander Syrskyi said: \u201cIn these complicated circumstances, I met fighting brigades from our group of forces (in the northeastern Kupiansk region) to correct our plans and resolve issues on site.\n\u201cWe are continuing to move forward, step by step to liberate our land.\u201d\nThe blast on the road bridge to Crimea could limit Moscow\u2019s ability to supply its troops in southern Ukraine, although Russian President Vladimir Putin said the bridge had not been used for military transports for a long time.\nImages showed a section of the road bridge had come down and traffic was halted in both directions, although a parallel railway bridge was still operational. Blasts were reported before dawn on the 19-km (12-mile) bridge, which Putin ordered built after seizing and annexing the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.\nPutin told officials repair work should start quickly and that Russia would respond to the \u201csenseless\u201d attack.\nUkrainian media quoted unidentified officials as saying Ukraine\u2019s Security Service (SBU) had deployed maritime drones against the bridge. SBU spokesperson Artem Dekhtyarenko alluded to the idea that the agency would reveal details after Ukraine won the war, without directly claiming responsibility.\nUkraine says the bridge is illegal. It was hit by a massive explosion and fire in October.\nWithout Russia?\nThe grain deal was hailed as preventing a global food emergency when it was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey last year.\nGlobal commodity food prices rose on Monday, though the increase was limited, suggesting traders did not yet anticipate a severe supply crisis.\nWestern countries say Russia is trying to use its leverage over the grain deal to weaken financial sanctions, which do not apply to Russia\u2019s agricultural exports.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would continue to try to secure food for poor countries."}
