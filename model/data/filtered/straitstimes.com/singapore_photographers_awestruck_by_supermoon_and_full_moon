I was quite surprised to see it so bright and clear,\" said Mr Kuick, who stays in a five-room flat with his family of five on the top floor of Block 661 Yishun Avenue 4. He has two other sons, aged 12 and 14.\nMr Kuick was one of many readers who sent in their pictures of Thursday's (Aug 11) supermoon and Friday's full moon to The Straits Times.\nA supermoon occurs when the moon's orbit is closest to the earth. This makes the moon look brighter and larger than the usual full moon.\nThursday's supermoon was the final one of the year, and is called the Sturgeon Moon."}
