The region accounts for about a third of global supply, and traders are concerned the latest escalation could hit flows if energy facilities are attacked or supply routes blocked.\nA major strike by Israel on Iran\u2019s oil-exporting capacity could take 1.5 million barrels of daily supplies off the market, according to Citigroup. If Israel struck minor infrastructure, such as downstream assets and storage facilities, between 300,000 and 450,000 barrels of output could be lost, analysts including Mr Francesco Martoccia said in a note.\n\u201cTraders unwinding short bets could push crude prices higher on a wider war-risk premium,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Henik Fung said in a note, referring to investors ditching wagers that prices would fall.\n\u201cWTI could retest US$80 in the short term.\u201d\nBeyond the crisis, there are signs of ample supplies. Opec+ \u2013 the oil cartel and its allies \u2013 plans to restore some of its shuttered capacity, with increases set to start from December after a two-month delay. In the United States, official data showed crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 3.9 million barrels last week, their biggest increase in about five months. BLOOMBERG"}
