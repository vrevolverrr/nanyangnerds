Air raid alerts blared for several hours overnight into early Sunday over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine, extending from Kyiv and regions to the west of the capital through to the entire east and south.\nOfficials in the capital Kyiv and the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region also reported shooting down a reconnaissance and attack drone in the early hours.\nThe overnight strikes coincided with Ukrainian and Russian media reports of multiple explosions across Russian-occupied Crimea.\nUkraine launched more than 10 drones overnight on the peninsula, including three on the port of Sevastopol, a Russian-installed official said early on Sunday, adding that air defence systems repelled all the attacks on Sevastopol.\n\u201cNo objects (in Sevastopol) were damaged,\u201d Mr Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, said on the Telegram messaging app.\nThere were no immediate details of any damage from the strikes elsewhere on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\nBaza, a Telegram channel with links to Russia\u2019s law enforcement agencies, reported earlier on Sunday that according to the channel\u2019s preliminary information, there were no casualties in what it said was a series of attacks on Crimea.\nAccording to Ukrainian monitoring of Telegram channels, explosions took place in Sevastopol and Saki \u2013 where Russia has an airbase \u2013 as well as a few other places.\nStrikes on Russian-held targets have intensified in the past two weeks, especially in Crimea.\nUkraine, without confirming any role in those attacks, says destroying infrastructure is preparation for its planned ground assault.
