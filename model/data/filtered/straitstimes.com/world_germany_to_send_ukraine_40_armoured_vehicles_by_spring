Western nations have been reluctant, citing fears of becoming drawn into the war or provoking Russia.\nBut the Ukrainians have built momentum and Western nations have been expanding the range of weapons being provided.\nThe US-German announcement came a day after France promised to deliver AMX-10 RC light tanks \u2013 a vehicle that is wheeled rather than tracked but which shares the much heavier cannon typical on a tank.\nGermany also said it will follow the United States in sending a state-of-the-art Patriot missile air defence system to Ukraine.\nThe Russian embassy in Berlin on Friday condemned the planned new deliveries as \u201ca further step towards the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine\u201d.\n\u201cIt is particularly cynical that this decision was taken shortly before the Orthodox Christmas... against the backdrop of the ceasefire declared unilaterally by the Russian President (Vladimir Putin),\u201d it said.\nMr Putin\u2019s order given to stop fighting for 36 hours has been slammed by Western allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said it \u201ccannot and should not be taken seriously\u201d.
