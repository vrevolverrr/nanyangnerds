A month ago, Ukrainian troops launched their first major assault on Russian territory, capturing a swath of the Kursk region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading for Western nations to supply more long-range missiles and lift restrictions on using them to hit targets such as airfields inside Russia.\nBlinken's visit to London also comes a week after Britain suspended some arms export licenses with Israel over equipment that could be used in the war in Gaza.\nThe administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running to succeed him, is under pressure from critics of the war to suspend some arms deliveries to Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally.\nWhile Blinken is in London, he and Lammy will open talks on a UK-US Strategic Dialogue to strengthen ties which deliver growth and security, the British government said.\nThis will cover key elements of the UK-US relationship, including defence and security, Europe, Ukraine, the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific, and other global priorities, it added.\n\"In a more volatile and insecure world, it is even more important that we are highly aligned nations,\" Lammy said in a statement ahead of the meeting.
