That is why we recognise these incidents to be exceptions,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the Government will continue to push for better working conditions, training opportunities and career progression for all early childhood educators.\nHighlighting the important role of leaders in the sector, Mr Masagos said that a revised advanced diploma for aspiring early childhood education leaders was rolled out in April. It was updated to cover content related to leadership skills in the areas of curriculum, child safety and management, among others.\n\u201cThe quality of early childhood education in pre-schools hinges on the quality of leadership,\u201d he said.\nNearly 300 aspiring and in-service educators received the ECDA Training Award on Friday. The award fully sponsors students pursuing full-time professional early childhood education courses, and provides them with other grants and allowances.\nEight educators also received ECDA Scholarships to pursue further studies.\nOne of them, Ms Celeste Ng, 24, a senior teacher in Superland Preschool, is pursuing her bachelor\u2019s degree in early childhood education with a minor in special education at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\nShe had previously taken up the ECDA Training Award to read a diploma in child psychology and early education in Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2016.\nMs Ng hopes to do more for children with special needs. While society is more aware of the need to be inclusive, she said that parents are often not comfortable hearing from teachers that their children display signs of special needs."}
