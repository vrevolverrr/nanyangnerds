The United States has said it has seen no sign of Ukrainian involvement in the Crocus City Hall attack.\n\u2018A difficult morning\u2019\nWhile Ukraine has struggled to find weapons and soldiers for its war, it has kept up drone attacks on Russia, which has also launched increasing air assaults.\nMultiple air attacks on the Russian border region of Belgorod adjoining Ukraine killed two people and injured at least seven, the regional governor said.\nFurther east, a drone attack on the Samara region caused a fire at a major oil refinery, the latest in a series of strikes against Russia\u2019s energy industry.\nBelgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region as well as the regional capital, Belgorod, had been hit in drone and air attacks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shaping up to be a difficult morning,\u201d Gladkov said.\n\u201cAs a result of an air attack by Ukrainian armed forces on Belgorod, three balconies collapsed in an apartment building. One of these apartments was occupied by a married couple. To much grief, the man died from his injuries on the spot,\u201d he said.\nRussia said later March 23 that it had repulsed a barrage of Ukrainian missiles fired at the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.\nBut Sevastopol\u2019s governor Mikhail Razvozhayev later announced that rocket fragments had killed a 65-year-old resident and four other people had been injured.\n\u201cIt was the biggest attack in recent times,\u201d he said.\nEuropean tensions\nUkraine said 34 Russian drone strikes had targeted its territory, but 31 had been shot down.\nIn the major city of Kharkiv, near the war frontlines, four people were hit by a Shahed drone.\nKharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second city, was plunged into darkness on March 22 after mass attacks on Ukraine\u2019s electricity supply and some 275,000 people in the city were still without power on March 23, according to its governor Oleg Synegubov.\nMeanwhile disagreements between European partners over the possibility of ground operations have threatened to undermine crucial cooperation.\nLast month, French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out putting troops on the ground in Ukraine \u2013 a position he has not recanted from, despite a stern response from Berlin and other European partners.\nOn March 23, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, said Macron was endangering Europe, calling him a \u201cwarmonger\u201d.\n\u201cI think that President Macron, with his words, represents a danger for our country and our continent,\u201d Salvini told a gathering in Rome of right-wing and nationalist European leaders.
