The kangaroo court requires me to wear a mask... I do not respect the judge.\u201d\nShe also shouted at the security officer and refused to leave the courtroom, but was escorted out around 10 minutes later.\nAs part of subsequent police investigations into this incident, Tan was ordered to turn up for an interview at Central Police Divisional Headquarters on Aug 10, 2022.\nHowever, she did not do so and was also a no-show at the State Courts the following month.\nA group of police officers went to her Bukit Batok home after a warrant of arrest was issued against her on Nov 10, 2022.\nTan was in a police car when she spat at two of the officers\u2019 faces.\nBesides receiving an eight-week jail sentence in July 2023 for these offences, Tan was ordered to pay a fine of $4,200, failing which she will have to spend an additional 21 days behind bars.\nOn Friday, DPP Hidayat said that a doctor from the Institute of Mental Health found that Tan has residual symptoms of schizophrenia.\nThe doctor also stated in his report that her sovereign ideas are not part of a delusion.\nOn Friday, the DPP asked for her to be given between six and eight weeks\u2019 jail, saying: \u201cIt is egregious that the victim in question is a district judge... Judicial officers are unique in their roles in going beyond merely enforcing the law to being guardians of the rule of law and arbiters of justice.\n\u201cIt follows that they reasonably do and ought to command the highest levels of respect from the ordinary members of public, let alone those physically present in court proceedings.\u201d\nTan, who was not represented by a lawyer, said she had apologised to the judge.\nShe added: \u201cI have a right to free speech... There was no injury... My intention was not to cause hurt... There was no contract for me to wear a mask, or vaccinate, or keep quiet in court.\u201d\nTan also said that she believed that she was standing up for the people.\nSeparately, Glynn, then 40, was jailed for six weeks in 2021. He was later deported and barred from re-entering Singapore."}
