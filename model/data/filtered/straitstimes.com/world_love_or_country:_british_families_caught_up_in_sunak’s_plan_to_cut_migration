Immigration advice websites suggest it too could more than double, if the same calculation is applied as on income.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything that they\u2019re asking and... just as we\u2019re at the final hurdle, they changed the requirements,\u201d Ms Rebecca Kaya said on a visit to a family member\u2019s home in a small town outside Gloucester, England.\nBritain\u2019s Home Office, the interior ministry responsible for migration strategy, has said the new policies will not be applied retrospectively and until the immigration rules are amended the minimum income threshold will remain the same.\n\u201cWe are establishing the specifics of the policy, including how it will apply to those renewing visas, and will confirm more details in due course,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nIn their case, Mr Tom, earning \u00a332,000 as a self-employed carpenter, is the main provider while Ms Paige cares for their two-year-old daughter.\nHe will be eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain in April as his second spousal visa expires, but she fears he may have to leave if they do not meet the \u00a338,700 requirement.\n\u201c(This) is totally unfair on my child,\u201d she told Reuters in her home in Enfield, London. \u201cShe has a right to have both her parents here.\u201d\nThere is support for Mr Sunak\u2019s migration policies among parts of his party and the public.\nBut any heavy-handed move to tighten numbers also draws criticism from businesses who say it will harm the economy, and from those who accuse the government of dictating who they can and cannot love.\nOn its own, a tightening of spousal rules is unlikely to hit the economy.\nBut critics have warned that some of those on the spousal system first came to Britain for postgraduate degrees, the type of skilled worker the government should want to retain."}
