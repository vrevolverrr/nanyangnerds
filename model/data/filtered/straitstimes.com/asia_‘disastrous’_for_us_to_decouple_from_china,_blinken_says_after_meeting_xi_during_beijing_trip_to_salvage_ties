But the US must also respect China and not harm its legitimate rights and interests, he added.\n\u201cNeither party should try to shape the other by its own will, still less deprive the other of its legitimate right to development,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nIn a press conference held after his meeting with Mr Xi, Mr Blinken gave the assurance that the US does not seek to decouple from China, but is looking to \u201cde-risk and diversify\u201d. With nearly US$700 billion (S$938 billion) in trade last year, it would be \u201cdisastrous for us to decouple and stop all trade investment\u201d, he said.\nBut the US needs to protect its own critical technologies, \u201cso they aren\u2019t used against us\u201d. \u201cI made clear that we will continue to take targeted actions that are necessary to protect US national security,\u201d said Mr Blinken about his meetings with Chinese leaders.\nHe told reporters he had raised with them issues such as human rights, more people-to-people exchanges, and anti-narcotics cooperation, among others.\nHe stressed the importance of maintaining open lines of communication, but said military-to-military talks have not resumed. Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu had refused a meeting with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore recently, citing US sanctions against him.\nIn a briefing on Monday night, Mr Yang Tao, director-general of the North American and Oceanian Affairs Department at the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said defence talks cannot be reinstated until sanctions are removed on senior Chinese officials, including General Li.\nHe also dismissed the US\u2019 framing of \u201cde-risking\u201d as a defensive move. \u201cOur question is whether de-risking is just a repackaging of decoupling,\u201d said the official, who had been part of the various meetings in the past two days. \u201cIf, fundamentally, de-risking is about shutting China out, then it is turning away from cooperation, stability and development. It won\u2019t solve the US\u2019 problem and will boomerang, putting a drag on the whole world.\u201d"}
