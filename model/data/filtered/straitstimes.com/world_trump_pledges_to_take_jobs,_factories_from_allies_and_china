Ms Harris has blunted Trump\u2019s advantage on economic issues, based on a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Sept 24.\nAsked which candidate had the better approach to the \u201ceconomy, unemployment and jobs\u201d, some 43 per cent of voters picked Trump and 41 per cent selected Ms Harris. Trump held an 11-point lead over Ms Harris on the economy in late July.\nMs Harris is set to make a major economic speech in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Sept 25. Some of her proposals will also be broadly aimed at helping Americans build and maintain wealth, Reuters reported.\n\u2018Substantial tariff\u2019\nTrump said during his speech that his planned incentives would be offered only to foreign companies that relocated manufacturing to the US and hired American workers.\n\u201cI want German car companies to become American car companies. I want them to build their plants here,\u201d Trump said.\nCompanies that did not make their goods in the US, however, would face \u201ca very substantial tariff\u201d when sending their products into the US, he added.\nOn Sept 23, Trump said he would slap a 200 per cent tariff on John Deere\u2019s imports into the US if the agricultural equipment company moved production to Mexico as planned.\nPreserving and creating American manufacturing jobs by imposing expansive tariffs on friends and foes alike has become a central theme of Trump\u2019s economic message.\nWhile Trump and his allies say trade barriers are necessary to protect US industry, many economists say his proposals would boost inflation.\nTrump stated he would reward US-based manufacturers with tax breaks for research and development costs and the ability to write off the costs of heavy machinery in the first year.\nHe repeated his promise to slash the corporate tax rate from 21 per cent to 15 per cent for companies that make their products in the US.\nTrump also pledged to appoint a global manufacturing ambassador to convince foreign companies to move to the US. He also said he would create special low tax, low regulatory zones on federal lands for American-based manufacturers.\nIt is unclear what federal lands would be offered to foreign companies under Trump\u2019s plan, or how such an arrangement would work. If land remains in federal hands while foreign companies operate on it, those companies could in theory be exempt from property tax.\nTrump has been announcing new economic policies in recent months that his team believes are attractive to working and middle-class voters, including ending the federal taxation of tips and overtime.\nMany economists warn that ending such taxes will lower government revenues and explode the federal deficit.
