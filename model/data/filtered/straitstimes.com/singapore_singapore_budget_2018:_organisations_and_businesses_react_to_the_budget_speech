Pricing carbon is the most efficient, fair and cost-effective way to meet this commitment,\" she said.\nExecutive director Jen Teo said climate change is \"arguably the most important issue facing Singapore\". She added that consumers should play a role in reducing their carbon footprint.\nGrab\nLocal ride-hailing firm Grab noted that the Government is providing more support to encourage innovation here. It said companies should actively grow their tech ecosystems to enable Singaporeans to benefit from the digital economy.\nFew people in Singapore are experts in new technologies, such as data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the priority should be to arm local young talent with these skills that are highly sought after.\nDescribing South-east Asia as a region \"on the cusp of a digital transformation\", Grab said the Republic can compete with global firms by investing in capability development as well as creating digital innovations tailored to the region.\nErnst & Young Solutions\nMr Panneer Selvam, partner with the people advisory services, described the SG bonus as a pleasant surprise.\nHe noted that in last year's Budget, a personal income tax rebate of 20 per cent of tax payable, capped at $500, was accorded to both resident local and foreign taxpayers.\nThe tax rebate - a direct offset against a taxpayer's tax payable - had largely benefited those with above-average incomes.\nHe said some people may be disappointed that no rebates were announced this year.\nBut he added that the SG Bonus would be well received by lower income families regardless of their tax paying circumstances.\nDBS Bank\nDBS senior economist Irvin Seah said the Budget focused on long-term issues, such as economic transformation, innovation incentives, the social safety net, and fiscal sustainability.\nBut the short-term measures have revealed the Government's prudent approach towards managing prevailing macroeconomic dynamics, he noted.\nSuch measures include the increase in stamp duty for property purchases and the enhancement of corporate income tax rebates.\nOn the budgeted deficit of $600 million expected for the 2018 financial year, he said that \"we believe the outcome would surprise on the upside, given the sanguine economic climate\".\nMilestone Systems\nMr Benjamin Low, Asia-Pacific vice-president of video management system provider Milestone Systems, said security challenges have evolved rapidly over the years, increasing the demand for such services and driving the development of new technologies.\n\"Advanced technology such as facial recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, is increasingly embedded in the systems which keep us safe,\" he said.\nHe noted that there is a growing need for people with skills to run such technology, and lauded the Government's investment in initiatives such as TeSA.\nBaker Tilly TFW\nTax partner Boey Yoke Ping said the GST increase to 9 per cent was expected, though she said it is good news that it will not be immediate.\n\"Although likely to be implemented sooner rather than later between 2021 and 2025, we expect that the implementation will be stepped by one percentage point at each stage,\" she said.\nDeloitte Singapore\nRegional managing partner for tax Low Hwee Chua said that beyond the headline tax changes, there are welcome boosts for the environment, healthcare, infrastructure, charities and social services.\n\"It's another steady Budget from a Government that prides itself on providing financial and fiscal stability to attract investors and this approach will help position Singapore for the challenges of the new decade,\" he said.\nTableau Software\nData visualisation company Tableau Software senior vice-president of Asia-Pacific JY Pook called the new measures to up-skill Singapore's workforce encouraging.\nThis will bridge the gap between the demand and supply for talent with digital skills, as new and emerging technology is increasingly changing the way people work, he said.\nThough businesses have started to harness insights from data in their work, he said their decisions need to be quick to keep up with the change of pace today.\nPSB Academy\nChief executive officer Derrick Chang said the continued investment in innovation and new technologies is reassuring, and the move is an indication of the country's unwavering drive towards nurturing a future-ready core.\nHe stressed the need for a collaborative effort between the public and private sectors for innovation to grow.\nSingapore's appointment as Asean chair for 2018 also charts a path for the exchange of cross-border knowledge and ideas, he said.\nHe added that the country stands to benefit from a network of talented international alumni around the world, as more students here are studying in universities overseas, including at PSB Academy's satellite campuses across Asia."}
