Groups of five allowed to dine in\nThe cap on groups allowed to dine in at food and beverage (F&B) establishments will be raised from two currently to five next Monday.\nThis is in line with the current five-person cap on social gatherings.\nMOH said dining in remains an activity that carries a higher risk because many people are unmasked and in close proximity with one another while doing so.\nEntertainment at F&B establishments, such as live performances, recorded music and screening of videos, will continue to be prohibited to reduce the risk of transmission from patrons having to raise their voices to be heard while talking.\nOther prevailing measures, such as social distancing between groups of diners and the need to keep masks on at all times except when eating or drinking, will remain in place.\nREAD FULL STORY: S'pore to allow up to 5 to dine in from July 12, gathering size may go up to 8 end-July with 50% vaccinated\n2. Resumption of wedding receptions\nWedding receptions may resume from next Monday, with no more than 250 attendees allowed with pre-event testing.\nFor wedding receptions with 50 attendees or fewer, pre-event testing will be required for the wedding party only. The wedding party typically includes the couple and their bridesmaids or groomsmen.\nWedding receptions are considered higher-risk activities as attendees tend to socialise more and over a longer period of time, MOH said.\nThe ministry said attendees must continue to adhere to all other prevailing safe management measures to reduce the risk of transmission.\n3. Cap on group sizes for indoor activities such as gyms raised to five\nGyms and fitness studios may conduct indoor sports and exercise activities in group sizes of up to five from next Monday, up from the current cap of two.\nThe cap on class sizes for both indoor and outdoor classes will also be raised to 50, including the instructor, or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower.\nParticipants will continue to be limited to groups of five each. The current cap on class sizes is 30 people in groups of up to five.\nMOH said SportSG will release more details on such activities soon.\nREAD FULL STORY: Gyms, fitness studios to allow five people from July 12; class sizes to go up to 50\n4. Social gatherings at the workplace can resume\nWhile working from home continues to remain the default arrangement, social and recreational gatherings at the workplace will be allowed from next Monday.\nBut they must be limited to a total size of no more than five people, in line with the broader community rules.\nOther workplace measures remain in place. MOH said employers should implement flexible working hours and ensure employees who need to go to the workplace stagger their start times.\nCross-deployment of workers to different work sites is not allowed.\n5. Jobs Support Scheme to be tapered to 10% for two weeks\nAs previously announced, financial support will continue to be extended to affected sectors for another two weeks, from July 12 to 25.\nBusinesses that will continue to receive 10 per cent wage support during this period include F&B establishments, gyms and fitness studios, retailers, cinemas, museums and art galleries, as well as those involved in performing arts, arts education, historical sites and family entertainment.\nFrom July 15:\n6. Mandatory, routine fast and easy tests for staff in higher-risk settings to start on July 15\n\"Fast and easy\" Covid-19 tests using kits such as antigen rapid test (ART) kits have been progressively rolled out for staff in higher-risk settings over the past few weeks.\nFrom next Thursday, this will be mandatory as a form of rostered routine testing for staff in establishments offering dining in, personal care services such as facial and nail services, or make-up services. This also applies to spas and saunas, massage establishments and hairdressing salons, as well as gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked.\nThe swab tests can be self-administered under employer supervision, or carried out at designated quick-test centres.\nFrom July 16:\n7. ART kits to be sold at supermarkets, convenience stores from July 16\nART kits have been available at designated pharmacies since June 16.\nFrom next Friday, they will also be sold at more general retailers, like supermarkets and convenience stores.\nThe cap of 10 test kits per individual will also be lifted, allowing members of the public to buy as many as they need.\nFrom July 21:\n8. TraceTogether, SafeEntry requirements to be reintroduced in supermarkets\nThe requirement for all supermarkets to enforce TraceTogether-only SafeEntry and deploy SafeEntry Gateways to allow visitors to easily check in and out will be reintroduced from July 21.\nSince May 17, check-ins have not been required at supermarkets located within malls or buildings with the same operating hours, as checking in is already enforced at the entrance to the building.\nBut MOH said the high volume of patrons in supermarkets increases the risk of transmission.\nThe reintroduction of the rule requirement will facilitate more targeted contact tracing for those who visited indoor buildings at the same time as an infected person, the ministry said.\nOther standalone supermarkets that have been enforcing check-ins will continue to do so.\nREAD FULL STORY: TraceTogether check-in will be back in supermarkets from July 21\nEnd-July:\n9. Further changes to come once half of population is fully vaccinated\nDifferentiated measures for people vaccinated under the national vaccination programme will be introduced when at least half of the population has been fully vaccinated.\nSingapore is expected to cross this milestone around the end of July.\nMOH said this will allow vaccinated people to participate in more activities. Some of the measures the ministry said it is considering include:\n- Raising the caps on social gatherings and dining in to eight people;\n- Raising the cap for large activities or venues like concerts and weddings to 500 people;\n- Allowing more workers to return to the workplace, depending on the company's total percentage of vaccinated workers."}
