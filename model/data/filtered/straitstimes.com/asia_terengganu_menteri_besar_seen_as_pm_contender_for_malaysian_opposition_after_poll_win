He holds a PhD in aeroengine ignition and combustion from Leeds University in Britain and was a lecturer at Universiti Putra Malaysia before becoming political secretary to PAS president Hadi Awang in 2008.\nThe calm and soft-spoken technocrat is seen as being able to attract support from the broader public compared with other leaders from the religiously conservative PAS.\nTan Sri Muhyiddin said that by fielding Dr Samsuri in the by-election on Dec 2, \u201cthe public will see that we have many wise, capable, tested and moderate leaders\u201d.\n\u201cThere will be a time when PN will form the government,\u201d Mr Muhyiddin was quoted as saying by the Malay-language Sinar Daily news site.\nTun Dr Mahathir, who began backing the opposition front ahead of the August 2023 state elections, said on Dec 1 that Dr Samsuri has proven his capabilities in governing Terengganu effectively.\n\u201cIn Kemaman, we have a candidate who is truly qualified to be the prime minister,\u201d Dr Mahathir was quoted as saying by the Malaysiakini online news site.\nFormer health minister Khairy Jamaluddin turned political commentator said on his podcast: \u201cWe can see in Kemaman the chess move by PAS to put up Dr Samsuri in Parliament. That move is not to win the parliamentary seat of Kemaman \u2013 that is a chess move to place a prime minister from PAS.\u201d\nPAS has over the years pivoted to attract more professionals, including doctors, lawyers and lecturers, to shed its rural religious state government image and rebrand itself as a capable party that can administer at the federal level.\nIn the interview posted on social media, Dr Samsuri said PAS wants to be \u201can extremely dominant party\u201d in the next 10 years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about just Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Perlis anymore, but we\u2019re talking about our country, where the people are diverse and there are various ethnicities and religions,\u201d he said, referring to the four state legislative assemblies controlled by PN.\n\u201cPAS is not just for Malays and Muslims but it must be for every citizen regardless of race or religion. This requires effort and planning.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf we want PAS to progress in the next 10 years, we can\u2019t just appeal to the Malays but also many groups in Malaysia. Only then can PAS become strong and relevant in Malaysia.\u201d"}
