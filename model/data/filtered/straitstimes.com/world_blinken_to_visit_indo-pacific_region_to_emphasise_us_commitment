They are due to expire in 2023 in the case of the first two states and in 2024 in the case of Palau.\nUS Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell has said that the Pacific could be the part of the world most likely to see \"strategic surprise\" - comments apparently referring to possible Chinese ambitions to establish Pacific-island bases.\nWashington had not done enough to assist the region, Campbell said, and there was a very short amount of time to work with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and fellow Pacific power France, \"to step up our game across the board.\""}
