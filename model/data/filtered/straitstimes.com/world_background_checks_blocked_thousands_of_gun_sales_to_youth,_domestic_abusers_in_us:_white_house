Background checks for those convicted of domestic violence crimes have blocked more than 4,600 sales so far in 2024.\nDr Stefanie Feldman, who heads the new office, said the progress reflected a wide range of efforts. This included dozens of executive actions since Mr Biden took office, increased collaboration among federal agencies, closer work with state and local governments, and increased funding for enforcement of existing laws and mental health programmes.\nShe told Reuters that Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in the Nov 5 presidential election, would announce additional executive action soon.\nDr Feldman declined to provide any details, but said the action involved some \u201cwholly new ideas\u201d and would take hard work to complete before Mr Biden leaves office in January.\nGun safety has been a big focus for Mr Biden and Ms Harris \u2013 both of whom are gun owners \u2013 since they took office in 2021.\nThe US surgeon-general declared gun violence a public health crisis in June, calling for more research funding, better mental health access, and other steps such as secure storage.\nDemocrats largely favour stricter gun laws as a way to reduce deaths from gun violence, while Republicans generally oppose stricter laws, citing the right to bear arms established in the US Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment.\nDespite partisan divisions, Dr Feldman said her office had worked well with Republican state and local elected officials, and 17 states had passed legislation to address gun violence.\nThe office was also working with non-elected officials, including healthcare providers and executives, law enforcement and community leaders, some of whom might identify as Republican but shared a commitment to reduce gun violence.\n\u201cThe farther away you get from Washington, the less political this issue actually is,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone wants their kid to come home from school safely. Everyone wants their kid to be able to go play in the neighbourhood and be safe.\u201d REUTERS"}
