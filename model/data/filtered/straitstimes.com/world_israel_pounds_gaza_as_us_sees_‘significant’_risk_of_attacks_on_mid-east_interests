In fact, what we\u2019re seeing... is the prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region.\n\u201cIf any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation... our advice is: don\u2019t,\u201d he added.\nWashington has already deployed a significant amount of naval power to the Middle East in recent weeks, including two aircraft carriers, support ships and about 2,000 marines, to help deter attacks by Iran-affiliated forces that could inflame the wider region.\nMr Austin said a terminal high-altitude area defence (Thaad) system and additional Patriot air defence missile system battalions will be sent to the region, and more troops will be put on standby.\nIranian security officials told Reuters that Iran\u2019s strategy was for Middle East proxies like Hezbollah to pursue limited strikes on Israeli and US targets but avoid a major escalation that would draw in Teheran, a high-wire act for the Islamic republic.\nIsrael unleashed an aerial blitz on Gaza, which lies to its south-west, after Hamas militants breached the border and carried out a shock rampage through nearby communities, killing 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and taking 212 hostages back to Gaza.\nGaza\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday that Israel\u2019s air and missile strikes in retaliation had killed at least 4,741 and wounded 15,898, with more than a million of the tiny territory\u2019s 2.3 million people displaced.\nIsrael has amassed tanks and troops near the fenced border around Gaza for a planned ground invasion aiming to annihilate Hamas, after several inconclusive wars dating to its seizure of power there in 2007, after Israel ended a 38-year occupation.\nElaborating on Israel\u2019s strategy in remarks to Fox TV on Sunday, military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said it was \u201cto have a weakened, tired and dislocated Hamas in preparation for our next stage of military operations\u201d.\n\u201cOur working assumption,\u201d he said, \u201cis that Hamas has prepared the battlefield, that there are various dimensions of warfare ready for us \u2013 specifically tunnels \u2013 and that Hamas, at least in the first and the intermediate stages, will fight and will inflict heavy casualties on (Israeli forces).\u201d\nHamas\u2019 armed wing said it had fired rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday. There was no immediate word of damage or casualties.\nWith Israel keeping up daily bombardments that have laid waste to swathes of the densely populated enclave, Palestinians said they received renewed Israeli military warnings to move from Gaza\u2019s north to the south to avoid the deadliest theatre of the war.\nThey said military leaflets dropped on the narrow territory, just 45km long, contained the added warning that they could be identified as sympathisers with a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d if they stayed put.\n\u201cFor your own safety, move southward. We will continue to attack in the area of Gaza City and increase attacks,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said."}
