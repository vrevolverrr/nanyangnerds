Sentosa Cove residents have volunteered to help with cleanup efforts.\n\u201cDuring this period, guests can continue to use our beaches, but swimming and sea activities on the beaches will not be allowed,\u201d said the statement. \u201cWe will provide subsequent updates on the Sentosa website in due course.\u201d\nSentosa Cove resident Chris Wright, 52, said he awoke to a \u201cstrong smell of oil\u201d on June 15.\nHe said: \u201cWe got up and looked over our balcony, and saw a long slick of oil visible from the coast of Sentosa, all the way to Lazarus and St John\u2019s Island.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wildlife around here, such as monitor lizards, and there were some photos circulating in resident WhatsApp groups of them covered in oil.\u201d\nWhatsApp groups are also being formed to round up volunteers to help with the cleanup, said Mr Wright, a writer and consultant.\nA message circulating in a Sentosa resident WhatsApp group seen by The Straits Times said volunteers are being recruited to help fill bags with sand stained by oil, and that \u201cany help is welcome\u201d.\nMr Wright said: \u201cThe situation is not pleasant for residents, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. I\u2019m more worried about the wildlife, because they are getting doused in oil.\u201d\nMs Sue Ye, founder of conservation group Marine Stewards, said the oil slick had reached Keppel Bay and Lazarus Island as well. She said the group expects to see many dead fish surfacing in the water in the coming days.\n\u201cThe oil might smoulder and suffocate birds and fish, marine animals that have to surface for air like turtles and dolphins, and even otters that use our waterways,\u201d she added. The group posted photos on Facebook of a kingfisher bird at Lazarus covered in oil.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t try to rescue it, as our boats cannot go out,\u201d Ms Ye said.\nMs Ye, who also works in boat and yacht chartering, said 10 chartered trips scheduled for this coming week have been cancelled and customers are asking for a refund.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of forgone income for the chartering companies. We don\u2019t know if we are going to come together to file a claim.\u201d\nShe added that her customers will have the option to reschedule their trips with an open ticket, which they can redeem in the next six months.\nA cyclist who lives about 1km from East Coast Park also said he could smell fumes the moment he woke up.\n\u201cI went to the park at around 10am, and I noticed the smell had become more pungent,\u201d said the cyclist, who works in the marine industry and did not want to be named.\nHe then spotted a large mass of oil in the waters near the Amber Beacon Tower, an observation tower in the park.\n\u201cI saw a few kids still playing there, so I told the parents to pack up and leave. There should be a prompt public announcement for the public to stay away.\u201d\nWhen The Straits Times visited the park at about 2pm, there was a strong smell of oil in the air. Black debris can be seen lining the shore.\nRetired consultant David Loh, 67, was driving past the beach when he decided to make a quick stop for some fresh air. Expecting the sea breeze, he became concerned when the smell of oil hit him instead.\nHe said: \u201cAs I walked closer to the shore, I could see the black oil washing up. The smell was very strong.\u201d\nHe decided to go home. \u201cI don\u2019t think smelling this is healthy \u2013 I think people should go home.\u201d\nAssistant engineer Zulfadhli Sulaiman, 39, and his brother\u2019s children were playing in the sand when they noticed people leaving the water. \u201cThe oil had started to reach us, and everyone was getting out of the water.\u201d\n\u201cMy kids had planned to take a dip in the water too, but in the end they couldn\u2019t. I know they\u2019re a bit disappointed.\u201d\nArmed with brooms, shovels and plastic bags, workers from Re Sustainability Cleantech began the cleanup at East Coast Park around 3.30pm, removing debris on the beach further from the waterline to prevent contamination from the rising tide.\nHowever, one worker said they would not be able to clean up the debris contaminated by the oil until Sunday morning, when the tide is low.\nSixteen signboards will be put up across the park to warn visitors to avoid the shoreline.\nIn a Facebook post on June 15, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said he went to Labrador Nature Reserve, where the National Parks Board has deployed booms to protect the rocky shores from the oil.\nHe also visited West Coast Park, which the slick had not hit yet, as well as East Coast Park.\nOil booms are floating barriers that help to control the spread of oil.\nThe public is advised to stay away due to the strong fumes, said Mr Lee.\n\u201cMany people want to help, and we\u2019ve received many messages of concern. We will put out points of contact shortly so you can contact them, and they will coordinate.\u201d\nMr Lee, who is an MP for West Coast GRC, said while the oil had not reached the West Coast Park area yet, the authorities were keeping a close watch on this.\n\u201cBooms have been emplaced in the canals that feed the mangrove as a precautionary measure,\u201d he added.\nOne\u00b015 Marina in Sentosa Cove and Marina at Keppel Bay have notified patrons that they have temporarily closed their entrances to install an oil boom.\nOne\u00b015 Marina declined to comment, and The Straits Times has asked Marina at Keppel Bay for more details.\nMr Quek Wee Teck, president of the Association of Boat Charter Singapore, said the association is considering a class action lawsuit against the firms that own the vessels involved for loss of income due to trips cancelled and marina closures.\nThe association has about 30 charter firms as members, and they manage a total of about 50 charter boats.\nOn average, members make between 80 and 100 trips out to sea every weekend, said Mr Quek.\nEach trip usually brings in between $1,500 to $2,000 for the company.\n\u201cWe are monitoring the situation to see how long the marina closures will last and how that could translate into potential losses,\u201d he said.\nMr Quek added that past oil spill incidents in Singapore did not result in the closures of the marinas, and there had not been prolonged periods when boats could not go out other than during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cIf things drag longer, our damages will be much higher, and we\u2019ll consider the class action suit,\u201d he said.\nCleanup operations are carrying on at Pasir Panjang Terminal after a boat hit another vessel.\nThe incident involved the Netherlands-flagged dredging boat Vox Maxima and the Singapore-flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour, which was stationary."}
