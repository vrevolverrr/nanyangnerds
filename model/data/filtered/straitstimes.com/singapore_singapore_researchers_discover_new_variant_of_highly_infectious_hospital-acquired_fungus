Hence, we proceeded to further investigations to determine if the genome was unique,\u201d added Dr Ko.\nShe is also the genomics director of the Pathology Academic Clinical Programme under SingHealth and Duke-NUS Medical School.\nAfter finding out that the patient\u2019s C. auris belonged to a clade that was genetically different from the existing five, the team looked through the hospital\u2019s archive and found two other cases.\nOne was an Indonesian patient who had been shuttling between the healthcare systems of Singapore and Indonesia.\nThe other was a Bangladeshi patient who had since returned to his country.\nDr Ko added that no treatment was needed for the Singaporean patient as he had no known infection and was asymptomatic.\nTheir discovery was published in peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet Microbe in July 2024.\nC. auris is a fungus that is highly transmissible and hard to get rid of.\nIt affects mostly patients with severe underlying medical conditions.\nThose with invasive medical devices, such as breathing or feeding tubes and catheters, tend to be at higher risk of getting C. auris and developing a range of infections, from superficial to more severe, life-threatening ones."}
