It is a stark contrast to peers around the globe and one that\u2019s raising questions about the country\u2019s future as an industrial powerhouse.\nGermany had been singled out by forecasters as the world\u2019s only major developed nation that would fail to record economic expansion in 2023 \u2013 largely due to its manufacturing sector reeling from higher energy costs, surging interest rates and subdued foreign demand.\nWhile 2023 began with relief that the energy shock triggered by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine would be more manageable than initially feared, the economy lost steam and never regained traction. A recovery that had been expected in the second half of the year failed to materialise, with output faltering even as inflation retreated.\nThe disappointing performance sparked a debate over whether Germany is once again turning into the \u201csick man\u201d of Europe \u2013 a moniker it first earned after reunification in the 1990s weighed on the economy and brought stubbornly high unemployment.\nTop officials including Finance Minister Christian Lindner and Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel have dismissed such talk, insisting the country has proved it can adapt to a changing environment.\nThe central bank has nevertheless acknowledged challenges to a business model that was long based on Russian energy imports and a strong reliance on China \u2013 both for components and as a market for combustion-engine cars.\nWhile natural gas prices have fallen sharply from a peak reached after the Kremlin cut off supplies, they remain higher than before Covid-19 struck. The chemical industry is among the sectors most affected, with companies including BASF and Lanxess responding by shelving investments and laying off workers.\nContinued squabbling within Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party alliance has, meanwhile, highlighted the difficulty in agreeing on measures to tackle Germany\u2019s woes.\nThat has helped feed a surge in popularity for the far-right Alternative for Germany, which now leads polls in three eastern German provinces that hold elections in 2024. Most recently, dissatisfaction with the government has brought protests by farmers, who disrupted traffic nationwide last week and are holding their main rally in Berlin on Jan 15.\nThe Constitutional Court created further headwinds at the end of 2023 by disrupting the coalition\u2019s plans to finance investments via off-balance sheet funds, forcing savings in the current budget and fuelling fresh uncertainty among households and firms.\nOngoing concerns about Germany\u2019s prospects are reflected in forecasts for 2024. The OECD said in November that, at 0.6 per cent, growth will be the slowest among all Group of 20 members except Argentina. BLOOMBERG"}
