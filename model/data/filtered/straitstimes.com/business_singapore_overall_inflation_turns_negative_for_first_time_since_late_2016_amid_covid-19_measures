It had dropped to minus 0.2 per cent in March and minus 0.1 per cent in February.\nOverall or all-items inflation fell to minus 0.7 per cent in April from zero in March, driven mainly by a larger decline in the cost of private transport on top of the slide in core inflation, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a joint release on Tuesday.\nPrivate transport costs fell more steeply to minus 5.5 per cent in April, from minus 0.3 per cent in March, reflecting a sharp drop in car prices and a larger decline in petrol prices. The suspension of Electronic Road Pricing charges in April also lowered private transport costs.\nThe cost of retail and other goods saw a larger decline year on year to minus 1.6 per cent in April, from minus 0.9 per cent in March. This was due to a sharp drop in the price of telecommunication equipment, as well as a bigger fall in the prices of personal effects such as travel goods.\nAccommodation costs were unchanged at 0.5 per cent year on year in April as housing rents rose at a steady pace.\nThe cost of electricity and gas fell 5.2 per cent year on year in April, a slower pace of decline than the 6.2 per cent drop in March. The pace of decline in the cost of electricity and gas had eased as the Open Electricity Market had a smaller dampening effect on electricity prices due to a slowdown in new take-up rates.\nFood costs rose by 2.1 per cent year on year in April, from the 1.5 per cent increase in March, due to non-cooked food items recording larger price increases. Meanwhile, inflation in prepared meals remained broadly unchanged.\nServices inflation fell to minus 1.1 per cent year on year in April and was up from minus 0.7 per cent in March, due to steeper declines in holiday expenses and airfares, as well as a smaller increase in domestic household services costs."}
