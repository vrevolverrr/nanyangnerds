When she declined, he threatened to break her face. Later that night, he suddenly charged towards her and punched her hard in the face, causing her to fall backwards and hit a cupboard.\nShe suffered a fractured nose, broken blood vessels in her eye and a fractured finger, and was hospitalised for seven days. Following the incident, she obtained a personal protection order to restrain the man from committing family violence against her, as well as a domestic exclusion order, to restrict him from entering her home.\nAs a result, the man had to move out. With nowhere else to go, he turned to his mother.\nHis mother, who needed a walking stick to move around, agreed to let him stay with her in her rented one-room flat.\nOn the night of April 27, 2021, the man, who had consumed at least 20 cans of beer, suddenly placed his belt around his mother\u2019s neck and tightened it, but eventually released the strap. After the woman went to sleep, the man climbed onto her bed and removed her clothes by force.\nThe victim resisted and told him to stop, but to no avail.\nThe man molested his mother, grabbed her neck, and punched her when she continued to struggle.\nHe tried to sexually violate her but she pushed his hand away. The man became tired and fell asleep.\nThe next morning, while she was waiting for the lift to go to the market with a neighbour, her son told her that he would kill her if she told anyone about the incident.\nThe neighbour later noticed that the right side of the victim\u2019s mouth was swollen and called the woman\u2019s granddaughter. The granddaughter then called the police."}
