This was due to a bigger increase in the prices of non-cooked food items.\nOn the other hand, the pace of decline in the cost of electricity and gas eased, as new subscriptions under the Open Electricity Market slowed.\nAccommodation inflation was unchanged at 0.5 per cent year on year, as housing rents rose at a steady pace.\nExternal sources of inflation are likely to remain benign amid weak global demand conditions in the quarters ahead, the MAS and MTI said, with oil prices expected to stay low for an extended period.\n\"At the same time, supply chain disruptions associated with international measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak could continue to put some upward pressure on imported food prices.\"\nDomestically, subdued economic sentiment and weak labour market conditions will dampen consumer demand, capping price increases for discretionary goods and services, and cost pressures are likely to remain low.\nThe MAS core inflation and overall consumer price index are forecast to average between minus 1 and 0 per cent this year."}
