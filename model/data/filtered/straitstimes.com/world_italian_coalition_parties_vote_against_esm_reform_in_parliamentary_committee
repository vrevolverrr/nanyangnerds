A motion to oppose the reform was backed by Meloni's Brothers of Italy party and Matteo Salvini's League, while the more moderate Forza Italia party abstained.\nThe ESM vote came the day after EU member-states clinched a deal on more lenient fiscal rules, which Italy welcomed as positive after months of tough negotiation with its partners.\nThe Italian government indicated earlier this month that it would not approve the ESM treaty unless there was first an accord on the bloc's Stability and Growth pact.
