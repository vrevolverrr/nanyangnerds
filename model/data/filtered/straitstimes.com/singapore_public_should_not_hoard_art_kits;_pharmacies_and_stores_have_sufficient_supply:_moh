The rise in cases has led to increased demand for ART kits.\nChecks by The Straits Times on Dec 6 found that some pharmacies and stores had run out of ART kits, and not all had been restocked the day after.\nIn the week ending on Dec 2, 32,035 people were diagnosed with Covid-19, the highest number of infections recorded in 2023.\nIn the week of Nov 19 to 25, the estimated number of infections was 22,094, more than double the 10,726 in the week of Nov 12 to 18.\nMOH said in an earlier statement that the spike in cases could be due to many factors, including the year-end travelling season and waning population immunity."}
