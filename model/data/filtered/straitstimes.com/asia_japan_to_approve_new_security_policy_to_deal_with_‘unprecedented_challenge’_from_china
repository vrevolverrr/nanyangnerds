The missile has a range of more than 1,250km, meaning it could be used to hit naval bases on the east coasts of China and Russia.\nJapan also intends to obtain sufficient supplies of missiles, including those made on its own, over the coming decade with ranges long enough to strike military assets in its three nuclear-armed neighbours that have been a focus of Tokyo\u2019s concerns.\nStill no to nukes\nWith its new strategy in place, the government is also considering revising the defence guidelines governing its military cooperation with its only formal treaty ally, the United States, according to Kyodo News, which cited government sources.\nMr Kishida may raise the issue during a visit to the US that the government is seeking to organise for January, the agency said.\nJapan will retain its \u201cexclusively defensive\u201d posture, as well as its ban on nuclear weapons, according to the documents.\nNevertheless, China has made clear to Japan its objections to the wording in the new documents, saying Beijing was committed to maintaining peace and stability.\n\u201cThe Japanese side ignores facts,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a Wednesday news conference. \u201cHyping up the \u2018China threat\u2019 to find an excuse for its military build-up is doomed to fail.\u201d"}
