The company unveiled the next generation mixed reality headset Quest 3 earlier in 2023.\nFor China, Meta plans to use lenses in the headset that are cheaper than those in the Quest 3, according to WSJ. This version will also be sold in other markets.\nThe report added that Meta would take a bigger share of device sales, while Tencent would take more of the content and service revenue, with the cheaper headset also providing games and other apps published by the Chinese company.\nMeta and Tencent did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.
