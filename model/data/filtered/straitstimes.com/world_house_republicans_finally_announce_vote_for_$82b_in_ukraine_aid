And this is a pivotal moment\u201d, Mr Biden wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.\nMr Biden argued in the journal that the aid is needed to help Ukraine, which is running out of ammunition, and Israel in the wake of last weekend\u2019s mass Iranian drone attack.\nBut he said the assistance is just as important for US security.\n\u201cMr Putin wants to subjugate the people of Ukraine and absorb their nation into a new Russian empire. The government of Iran wants to destroy Israel forever \u2013 wiping the world\u2019s only Jewish state off the map,\u201d Mr Biden wrote.\n\u201cAmerica must never accept either outcome \u2013 not only because we stand up for our friends, but because our security is on the line, too.\u201d\nMr Biden said the money would not be \u201cblank cheques\u201d.\nThe weaponry for Ukraine would be built in US factories, he said, writing: \u201cWe\u2019d help our friends while helping ourselves.\u201d\nHe also sought to allay concerns within his own Democratic Party, where growing numbers of members oppose arming Israel during its devastating war against Hamas.
