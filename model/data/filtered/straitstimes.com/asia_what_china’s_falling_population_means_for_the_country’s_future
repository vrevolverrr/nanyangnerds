That\u2019s China\u2019s message for couples after decades of limiting most families to just one child. Why the turnabout?\nThe reason is that births have now fallen for six years in a row, leading to a population drop last year for the first time since the 1960s.\nEven before the historic overall decline, the working-age population had been shrinking for years, and projections show that one quarter of the population will be 60 or older by 2030.\nThis threatens economic growth, which has been predicated on a vast labour supply \u2013 not to mention there may not be enough able-bodied people to take care of all those seniors.\nThe upshot is that China\u2019s economy may struggle to overtake the US in size and the country could lose its status as the world\u2019s most populous to India this year.\n1. What\u2019s being done?\nThe Politburo decided in 2021 to allow all couples to have a third child, five years after changing its one-child policy to allow women to have two. (Family-planning policies were totally stricken from a new Civil Code, leaving room for the government to scrap birth limits altogether.)\nThe change to allow two kids worked at first: The number of newborns in 2016 was 17.9 million, a jump of more than 1 million from the year before.\nHowever, births dropped each year after that, to 9.56 million in 2022, the lowest since at least 1950.\nSome regions have started offering incentives for couples to have kids, from extending parental leave to offering subsidies and providing baby loans. Shenzhen, which neighbours Hong Kong, is working on plans to subsidize parents until their children turn three.\n2. How much did the population shrink\nThe fall in births and tick-up in deaths resulted in 850,000 fewer Chinese people living in mainland China in 2022 compared with 2021, according to official data released in January.\nThe head of the statistics bureau predicted the trend would continue, pointing to a \u201cdrop in people\u2019s willingness to have babies, the delay in marriage and pregnancy, as well as a fall in number of women of child-bearing age\u201d.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak that began sweeping across the country late last year will likely boost deaths in the short-term, which will come on top of the increase in deaths expected as the nation ages. In addition:\nThe share of the working-age population \u2013 those ages 15 to 59 \u2013 slumped to 62 per cent from more than 70 per cent a decade ago. Bloomberg Economics predicts the group will slump to about 650 million people in 2050, a drop of about 260 million from 2020.\nThe fertility rate, or average number of lifetime births per woman, fell to 1.3 in 2020, far below the 2.1 needed for a steady population, excluding migration.\nAs recently as 2019, the United Nations was forecasting that China\u2019s population would peak in 2031; by last year it had revised that estimate to 2022. It now expects China to lose 110 million people by 2050 and fall to about half its current size by the end of the century.\nThe UN projects that India will surpass China as the world\u2019s most populous country this year, four years ahead of an earlier estimate.\n3. What\u2019s the impact?\nIf the decline in the number of people of working age leads to a drop in how many people are actually working, that may raise the cost of labour in China, adding to the price of manufactured goods.\nWith fewer people starting families, there would also likely be hit to long-term demand for houses, which would have an impact on demand for commodities such as iron ore.\nThe government may also struggle to pay for its underfunded national pension system. All that could cut into the long-term growth potential of the economy unless government policies to promote having children become effective.\nThere could be ripple effects outside the country. For example, fewer children may reduce the number of Chinese students seeking education in the US, Australia and elsewhere.\nThe decline will be hard to reverse, even after the government ended its one-child policy. A traditional preference for sons caused many Chinese parents to abort female fetuses; the male-to-female ratio reached 120-to-100 in some provinces.\nThe sex ratio for births has stabilised at around 105 in recent years, but in some regions such as Guangdong and the tropical island of Hainan, the ratio remains elevated at above 110. One result is fewer women of child-bearing age.\n5. What\u2019s the solution?\nA change to the retirement age may address some of the issues. The country has kept it at 60 for men and 55 for women white-collar workers for more than four decades, even as life-expectancy has risen.\nThere\u2019s discussion again about raising the age, but as in other countries, such a move is very unpopular policy and there was a backlash when it was considered a decade ago.\nOn top of ending restrictions on the number of children, officials will need to build up support for families, including pre-schools and schools, as well as financial incentives or tax breaks. Time and financial concerns mean that many couples feel they can only afford to have one child \u2013 if any.\nThe central government has tried to relieve that burden, such as by wiping out the for-profit, after-school tutoring industry to lower education costs. It also issued a guideline to reduce abortions while providing more support to women to raise children.\nHowever, if the experience of Japan, South Korea and other developed nations is any guide, it\u2019s incredibly difficult if not impossible to radically raise birth rates, even with measures such as subsidies, free childcare and generous parental leave allowances. There\u2019s no reason to think the situation in China will be different. BLOOMBERG"}
