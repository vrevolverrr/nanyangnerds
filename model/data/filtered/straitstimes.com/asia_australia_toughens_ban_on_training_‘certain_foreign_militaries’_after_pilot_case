He faces extradition to the US on charges of training Chinese military pilots at a South African flying school.\nThe pilot, Australian citizen Daniel Duggan, remains in custody and denies any wrongdoing.\nThe Test Flying Academy of South Africa (TFASA) was placed on a US trade blacklist on the grounds of national security in June for \u201cproviding training to Chinese military pilots using Western and Nato sources\u201d.\nThe flight training division of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a Chinese state-owned aviation and defence company that was in partnership with TFASA, is also on the blacklist.\nThe Australian home of TFASA chief operating officer Keith Hartley was raided by the Australian Federal Police in November 2022. A court was told that Mr Hartley, a former British military pilot, was suspected of organising the training of Chinese military pilots delivered by the flight school. Mr Hartley has not been charged, and denies any wrongdoing.\nThe new law also forbids working for companies in which a foreign government holds 50 per cent of shares, or where directors are expected to act in accordance with the wishes of a foreign government.
