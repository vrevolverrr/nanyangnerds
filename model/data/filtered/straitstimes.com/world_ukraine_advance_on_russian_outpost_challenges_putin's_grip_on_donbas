Kyiv has said it won't be swayed by such threats and will press ahead with its plans to drive all Russian forces out of Ukraine.\nLyman has served for months as a logistics and transport hub anchoring Russian operations in Donetsk region's north and its capture would be Kyiv's biggest gain since a lightning counter-offensive retook swathes of Kharkiv region this month.\nThe window is narrowing for Ukraine to make major advances before winter sets in, slowing down operations and giving Russia, which has declared a partial mobilisation, more time to fortify its lines.\nKonrad Muzyka, director of the Rochan military consultancy in Poland, said Russian forces were trying to hold on in Lyman to buy time to prepare defensive lines and that the town would fall to Kyiv.\n\"The Russians are trying to delay the Ukrainian actions as much as possible so that they can create or upgrade their line of defence between Sievierodonetsk and the border with Russia,\" he said.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainians in his nightly speech on Tuesday that there was \"good news\" from the front, though he did not elaborate.\nLuhansk region's exiled governor said this week: \"When the situation around Lyman is resolved, then we can closely watch the actions of the Ukrainian army because Lyman is close to the river and on the other bank begins Luhansk region.\"\n\"The weather doesn't really play into our hands, but in general, I still think we'll get the result soon,\" he said.\nOn Thursday, a Russian proxy official in Donetsk region said it was \"pretty tense\" and \"difficult\" in Lyman and that Kyiv's forces were constantly trying to attack.\n\"Of course we understand that such attempts will continue, at the moment our units are able to repel all these attacks, \"the official was quoted as saying by Russia's Tass news agency."}
