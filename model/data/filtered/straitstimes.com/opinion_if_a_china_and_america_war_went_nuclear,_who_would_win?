It is grimmer still to think through a nuclear one. But somebody has to. And so Andrew Metrick, Philip Sheers and Stacie Pettyjohn, all of the Centre for a New American Security (CNAS), a think-tank in Washington, recently gathered a group of experts to play a tabletop exercise \u2013 a type of wargame \u2013 to explore how a Sino-American nuclear war could break out. The results were not encouraging.\nIn the exercise scenario, it is 2032 and a war over Taiwan has been raging for 45 days. China uses \u201ctheatre\u201d nuclear weapons \u2013 with a shorter range and smaller yield than the city-busting \u201cstrategic\u201d missiles \u2013 to shorten the war by coercing America into submission."}
