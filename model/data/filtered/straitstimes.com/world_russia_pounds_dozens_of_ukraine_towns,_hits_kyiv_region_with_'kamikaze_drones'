Shortly after Russia\u2019s invasion in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signalled he was willing to consider neutrality.\nBut hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed partially occupied regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as Russian land on Sept 30, Mr Zelensky made a fast-track bid to join.\nIn the past 24 hours Russian missiles hit more than 40 settlements, while Ukrainian air force carried out 32 strikes on 25 Russian targets, Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces General Staff said.\nThe southern port city of Mykolaiv came under massive bombardment, local officials said.\n\u201cIt is known that a number of civilian objects were hit,\u201d regional governor Vitaly Kim said in a social media post.\nHe said the top two floors of a five-storey residential building were completely destroyed and the rest were under rubble.\n'Kamikaze drones'\nRussia also targeted a settlement in the region of Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv, where three drone strikes hit critical infrastructure early on Thursday, the region\u2019s administration said on Telegram.\nGovernor of the Kyiv region, Mr Oleksiy Kuleba, said that based on preliminary information the strikes were caused by Iranian-made loitering munitions, often known as \u201ckamikaze drones\u201d.\nUkraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks with the Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin has not commented.\nMissiles struck about 30 multi-storey buildings and houses, gas pipelines and power lines in the city of Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region, leaving more than 2,000 families without electricity, regional governor Dnipropetrovsk Governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram.\nReuters was not able to immediately verify the reports.\nAs his forces suffered several setbacks since September, Mr Putin has ordered the call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaimed the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territory and repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia, including regions annexed last month.\nA senior Nato official said on Wednesday a Russian nuclear strike would almost certainly trigger a \u201cphysical response\u201d from Ukraine\u2019s allies and potentially Nato and on Thursday the US reaffirmed its commitment to its allies\u2019 defence.\n\u201cWe are committed to defending every inch of Nato\u2019s territory \u2013 if and when it comes to that,\u201d US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Brussels ahead of a meeting of defence ministers from the alliance, including close-door talks by its nuclear planning group.\nSeparately, 15 European Nato members announced plans for joint procurement of air defence systems, dubbed \u201cEuropean Sky Shield\u201d to better protect their territory.\nUN condemnation\nIn New York, three-quarters of the 193-member General Assembly \u2013 143 countries \u2013 backed on Wednesday a resolution condemning Russia\u2019s \u201cattempted illegal annexation\u201d of the four partially occupied regions in Ukraine.\nOnly Syria, Nicaragua, North Korea and Belarus joined Russia in voting against the resolution, while 35, including Moscow\u2019s strategic partner China, abstained, and the rest did not vote.\nIn Brussels, more than 50 Western countries met on Wednesday to pledge more military aid to Ukraine, especially air defence weapons, after heavy retaliatory strikes this week ordered by Mr Putin in response to an explosion on a bridge in Crimea.\nAmong the pledges were promises of air defence system deliveries from France and Britain, and Canada\u2019s commitment to provide artillery rounds among other supplies.\nAt the meeting, Mr Austin said Russia\u2019s latest attacks laid bare its \u201cmalice and cruelty\u201d. At least 26 people have been killed since Monday in Russian missile attacks across Ukraine.\nUkraine had shifted momentum since September with extraordinary gains, but would need more help, he said.\nSince Monday\u2019s attacks, Germany has sent the first of four IRIS-T SLM air defence systems, while Washington said it would speed up delivery of a promised NASAMS air defence system.\n\u201cThe more assistance Ukraine gets now, the sooner we\u2019ll come to an end to the Russian war,\u201d Mr Zelensky said by video to a forum during International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings in Washington.
