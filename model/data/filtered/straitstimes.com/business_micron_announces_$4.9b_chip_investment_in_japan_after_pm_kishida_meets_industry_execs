It described the tech as the \u201cmost sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing process in the world\u201d.\nMr Kishida told the chip executives that \u201cthe government will work towards further expansion of direct investment in Japan and support for the semiconductor industry\u201d, but there were no details on any financial support from Tokyo.\nBloomberg News earlier reported that the Japanese Premier is set to hand Micron US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion) in incentives.\nJapan has already agreed to pour half a billion dollars into a new project to develop and make next-generation chips domestically. The deal involves eight major companies, including Sony, SoftBank and Toyota, which are partnering each other in a new firm. The firm, called Rapidus, hopes to begin mass production by 2027.\nTSMC and Sony have also inked their own partnership for a US$7 billion plant in Japan.\nIn April, Europe, too, announced plans to ramp up local chip production, with a goal of doubling its current global market share to 20 per cent by 2030.\nChips are the lifeblood of the modern global economy, powering everything from cars to smartphones, and they are forecast to become a US$1 trillion industry globally by 2030.\nMuch of the world\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing is based in Taiwan. Fears have grown about the impact of any Chinese military action to seize the self-ruled island, which China claims as its territory.\nThe chip industry moves by Japan and Europe come as the United States and China lock horns over access to advanced semiconductors. Washington has in recent years sought to prevent advanced US chip tech from being exported to China, citing national security concerns.\nJapan and the Netherlands recently announced their own export restrictions on chip items, without naming China.\nStill, Beijing reacted angrily, and has called for a World Trade Organisation review of the measures.\nIn April, the Chinese authorities also announced an investigation into Micron, which they said was intended to \u201csafeguard national security\u201d.\nMr Kishida\u2019s meeting with chip firms came a day before he hosts Group of Seven (G-7) leaders for a summit in the city of Hiroshima.\nG-7 leaders are expected to call for \u201cde-risking\u201d of crucial supply chains, and to warn of the risks of \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d by China.
