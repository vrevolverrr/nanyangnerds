Instead, they thanked those who reported the sighting of the \u2018canine\u2019.\nThey went to Thorpe Park in Lincolnshire on March 3 after the organisation received \u201cmultiple consecutive reports\u201d of a dog stuck in a ditch.\nAs the volunteers headed to the site, located near Cleethorpes beach, another team simultaneously discussed its rescue plan with a local group specialising in lost pets.\n\u201cOn arrival, we were thankful to hear... It was a statue! A statue that had already been rescued by an on-site member of staff,\u201d Cleethorpes Wildlife Rescue said on its Facebook page.\nIt posted a picture of the life-like 60cm stone statue of a spaniel in the ditch, and another picture of the statue after its retrieval.\n\u201cThank you to those who reported with good intent, and thank you to our water rescue volunteers for their immediate response \u2013 on scene and ready to go in less than 20 minutes!\u201d the organisation added.\nThe public was full of praise for the group, which provides rehabilitation for injured wildlife.\n\u201cThank goodness, it looked so real in the original photo, well done to the person who reported it, they must\u2019ve been mortified,\u201d said Ms Sally Johnson, commenting on the post.\nMs Janey Bugg noted that it was \u201camazing\u201d that so many people \u201cscrambled\u201d to check out the report and \u201cin such a short space of time too\u201d.\nAnother commenter, with the handle PickWalks_GY, quipped: \u201cActually quite a cute statue.
