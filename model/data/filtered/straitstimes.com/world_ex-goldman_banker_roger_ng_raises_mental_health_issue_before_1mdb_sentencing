{"title": "Ex-Goldman banker Roger Ng raises mental health issue before 1MDB sentencing", "tags": "world", "timestamp": "2023-03-09", "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Roger Ng, the only Goldman Sachs Group banker tried and convicted in the global 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal, said he suffers a \u201csubstantial mental health condition\u201d and should not receive the 15-year prison term sought by prosecutors.\nNg, 51, faces sentencing on Thursday before United States District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn, New York. The former managing director, who was found guilty in April 2022, said in a letter to the judge on Wednesday that a court-appointed psychiatrist found he suffers from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nThat PTSD is \u201clikely going to be exacerbated by confinement and by any experiences that reactivate his trauma,\u201d his lawyer Mr Marc Agnifilo wrote. \u201cFurther incarceration would exacerbate this serious mental health condition.\u201d\nUS Attorney Mr Breon Peace\u2019s office has urged that Ng be given a lengthy sentence because he was a key player in the conspiracy to loot the Malaysian fund of billions of dollars. But Ng has asked Judge Brodie to sentence him to no jail time in the US, arguing that the six months he spent in a Malaysian prison before extradition to New York and four years of house arrest were punishment enough.\nMr Agnifilo on Wednesday also argued that Ng deserves leniency because the Malaysian government \u201chas been made whole\u201d as he relinquished claims to US$35.1 million that it seized from his accounts.\nBut prosecutors argue that Judge Brodie should ignore Ng\u2019s pleas for time served.\n\u201cRoger Ng played a critical role in a massive bribery and money laundering scheme that stole billions of dollars intended for infrastructure and economic projects to aid the Malaysian people,\u201d prosecutors said in court papers. They urged Judge Brodie to \u201csend a message to other professionals in the financial world who are tempted to gain an advantage or to win business through cheating and bribery\u201d.\nNg and his former Goldman boss, Tim Leissner, were accused of conspiring with Malaysian financier Jho Low, the scheme\u2019s alleged mastermind. Low paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to clinch bond deals arranged by Goldman, taking US$1.42 billion for himself. Low, who was indicted with Ng, is a fugitive.\nLeissner pleaded guilty and was the government\u2019s star witness at Ng\u2019s trial. He will be sentenced in September but will likely get less time due to his cooperation. Prosecutors say Leissner made US$73.4 million in the scheme.\nFormer Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak received US$756 million and Khadem al-Qubaisi, a former managing director of Abu Dhabi\u2019s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co, which guaranteed the 1MDB transactions, got US$472.8 million, a forensic accountant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified at Ng\u2019s trial.\nGoldman paid more than US$2.9 billion to US authorities and more than US$5 billion globally for its role in the scheme, with its Malaysian unit pleading guilty in the US to a single conspiracy charge. Goldman\u2019s US penalty was the largest-ever for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a fact which Mr Agnifilo highlighted on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe government already sent its message to the world about Goldman when it accepted its money for a deferred prosecution agreement,\u201d Mr Agnifilo wrote on Wednesday.\nMr Jeff Ifrah, a white-collar defence lawyer and expert on federal sentencing guidelines, said Ng would have a tough time convincing the judge to sentence him to time served. He noted that the size of the fraud is a factor when it came to sentencing and the scale of the looting at 1MDB suggested Ng could get as many as 30 years.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re above that range, it\u2019s equivalent to launching a nuclear weapon in Times Square,\u201d Mr Ifrah said. \u201cHow much is the judge going to reduce from that?\u201d BLOOMBERG"}
