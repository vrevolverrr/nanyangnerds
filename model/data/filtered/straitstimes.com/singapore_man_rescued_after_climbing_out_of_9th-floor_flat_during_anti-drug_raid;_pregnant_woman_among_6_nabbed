The raid escalated into a \u201clife and death situation\u201d when one of the men climbed out of a bedroom window and lost his footing, said the CNB.\nMultiple officers pulled the struggling suspect, 25, to safety before he was arrested for drug trafficking.\n\u201cA suspected drug offender had total disregard for his own safety and that of others while attempting to evade arrest,\u201d said CNB senior assistant director of intelligence operations William Tan.\n\u201cThis turned into a life and death situation when our officer, who was arresting the suspect, had to hold on to the suspect when the latter lost his footing.\n\u201cOur officers have to make split-second decisions during operations, even placing themselves in great danger to ensure the safe arrest of suspects.\u201d\nThe CNB officer suffered deep lacerations to his right arm and was taken to hospital for treatment.\nIn an earlier raid that day, CNB officers arrested a 28-year-old man and a 26-year-old pregnant woman in another Bedok North Road flat.\nThe woman, whose nine-month-old child was in the flat during the raid, was arrested for drug consumption. The child has been placed in the custody of a next of kin, the CNB said.\nThe man had evaded an earlier arrest attempt in the early hours of Monday morning and crashed his van near Kaki Bukit Avenue 3. Nearly 1kg of heroin was recovered from the van.\nIn total, about 437g of methamphetamine (or Ice), 1,322g of heroin, five Ecstasy tablets and 18 tablets suspected to contain other controlled drugs, with an estimated street value of $158,500, were seized from the two flats and the van."}
