We need to act and put in place measures now,\u201d Mr Ong and Mr Masagos said in their Facebook posts.\n\u201cThe starting point is screen time for the very young, 0-six years old. This shapes their habits in social media usage,\u201d they said, adding that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) oversee the key touch points for children up to six years old, through child and maternity care, and pre-schools.\nThe impact of screen time on child development is a key focus of Gusto \u2013 Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes \u2013 a local research effort, which has followed children conceived in 2009, the ministers said.\nThe Gusto study examines how conditions in pregnancy and early childhood influence the health and development of women and their children.\nOne finding from the study showed that pervasive screen time when the child is 12 months old altered brain activity before the child is two years old.\nIt also negatively affected executive function \u2013 a set of mental skills such as self-control and working memory \u2013 when the child reached nine years of age.\n\u201cAnother study found that screen time in infancy contributes to enduring individual differences in topological brain restructuring. Simply put, screen time exposure compromises the brain development of young children,\u201d said the ministers in their posts.\nAnother yet-to-be-published study explores how a child\u2019s mental wellness is affected by the linkage between brain development and executive function, they added.\nThe ministers said that the MOH and MSF have been discussing this issue of screen time over the past months, and share the concerns expressed by Dr Murthy. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has also said tackling the mental health challenge is a national priority.\nThey said: \u201cThe impact of social media on mental health is not an unintuitive concept. Today, young minds are exposed to information, interactions and behaviours they do not have the maturity for; it takes away time for physical play and interactions, all of which can affect them profoundly as they grow up.\u201d"}
