This leads to the death of brain tissue.\nEndovascular treatment, which \u201cunblocks\u201d the vessel and restores oxygen flow to brain tissue, is a highly time-sensitive treatment. Administering it to the patient as soon as possible is crucial for the best possible outcome.\nDr Leonard Yeo, senior consultant in the Division of Neurology at NUH\u2019s Department of Medicine, said: \u201cWith each minute of delay in opening a blocked artery, the patient could lose 1.9 million brain cells, hence \u2018time is brain\u2019. The earlier we unblock the artery, the better the patient outcome.\u201d\nAcute ischaemic stroke is the biggest cause of disability in Singapore and across the world. Before the use of AI, the process of identifying such stroke victims could take up to 20 minutes.\nNUH started using RapidAI in February 2023 on suspected stroke patients at the hospital\u2019s emergency department. Patients do not need to pay extra for its use.\nMore than 400 patients have been assessed with the tool and an estimated 30 to 35 of them received endovascular treatment.\nWhen a suspected stroke patient first enters the emergency department at NUH, he undergoes an emergency computerised tomography (CT) scan. The imaging data from the scan automatically flows into and is processed by the RapidAI platform. The tool then generates easy-to-interpret colour-coded images and sends the results via a secured e-mail to a medical team of stroke neurologists and interventional radiologists.\nThe entire process takes less than a minute, and includes valuable information about the proportion of the brain that has been damaged in the stroke, and the parts of the brain that can potentially be saved through medical intervention.\nThe information helps the team make a swift decision to carry out the most appropriate treatment.\nSaid Dr Yeo: \u201cNUH is using the power of AI to shave life-saving minutes off an emergency like a stroke. This can avoid the extent of brain damage that can cause paralysis and loss of speech and cognitive functions.\u201d\nIn the past, radiographers manually processed the CT scans. Doctors then logged in to their laptops or went to an imaging workstation to review the information.\nAdjunct Associate Professor Anil Gopinathan, head and senior consultant in the Division of Interventional Radiology at the Department of Diagnostic Imaging at NUH, said: \u201cBefore we adopted this AI platform, it was impossible to expect all this information to be made so promptly available for the senior clinicians to review and make a decision.\n\u201cAI has the potential to completely change the speed at which therapeutic decisions are made, thereby reducing the amount of brain cells lost and improving the likelihood of a stroke patient walking out of the hospital.\u201d"}
