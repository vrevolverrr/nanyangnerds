In times of difficulties, this is the nest we return to for comfort and succour.\nBuilding a resilient family can be challenging for individuals; hence, support from the relevant agencies, social institutions and also employers is imperative.\nAs Singaporeans want to spend more time with their families, employers are encouraged to adopt work-life-friendly practices which can lead to better job performance and morale.\nHowever, the growing numbers of the elderly left to live alone may pose economic, healthcare and social challenges.\nSome older people prefer to live alone or with their ageing spouse for reasons such as changes in family values, lifestyles, and their children\u2019s greater job mobility.\nWhatever the case may be, young families must stay in touch with ageing parents and also visit them regularly as no institution can replace the love and warmth of family members."}
