But Mr Tong said its business had grown by \u201cmore than 20 per cent in the last two years\u201d.\nHe does not have a target market share with the new EV policy, although he is confident it will outperform the insurer\u2019s current motor insurance market share.\nThere are more than 20 motor insurers in Singapore, but only eight are known to offer coverage for EVs. Out of the eight, only one other is known to address EV fire risks. Singlife\u2019s Prestige package pays 110 per cent of an EV\u2019s market value at the time of loss caused by \u201cfire or explosion during charging\u201d.\nAccording to the Singapore Civil Defence Force, there were two EV fires here in 2022, up from one in 2021. Although rare, they are not insignificant in relation to their small and young fleet here.\nCompared with their respective population here, EV fires averaged 2.45 per 10,000 vehicles, versus 0.42 for electric hybrids and 1.97 for pure internal combustion engine vehicles.\nAccording to global reinsurer MS Amlin, high voltages needed to charge EVs can pose an electrocution risk, especially when there is damage to cables and charging equipment caused by wear and tear or misuse.\nMr Tong noted that \u201cas the EV market gets bigger \u2013 as we expect it to \u2013 the number of mishaps would naturally be higher\u201d. The three additional areas of coverage would thus \u201cprovide peace of mind to consumers\u201d.\n\u201cThat is what insurance is about,\u201d he said."}
