That's why I am heartened to see PDP participants not only committed to the three-year journey, but also intent on applying acquired skills and competencies to your work,\" she added.\nMadam Noorlinda Buang, 55, who finished the PDP for leaders last year, said she enjoyed her overseas study trip to Taiwan in 2019 as part of the programme.\n\"I was very inspired by the leaders of the pre-schools there, which took in children with special needs,\" said the centre principal of a PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots centre in Jurong West.\n\"I felt more confident and inspired to support kids and their parents,\" she said. Her centre now has five children with special needs, and an assistant teacher who has mild intellectual disability.\nMadam Noorlinda joined the early childhood sector in 2004 after her warehouse supervisor husband was retrenched and she was looking for work. She had previously stopped working in the retail sector to take care of her four children.\nVolunteering with Mendaki was the first time she worked with young children.\n\"I was helping them with reading, preparing for Primary 1, knocking on doors to get children to go to school,\" she said.\nShe has since taken up several early childhood qualifications including two diplomas and a degree from private providers while working across several pre-schools in the last two decades.\nOne of her daughters, aged 24, is also working in PCF as an educarer.\n\"Being in this sector gives me a sense of satisfaction and pride, seeing the changes in the children,\" said Madam Noorlinda, who hopes to take up a course next year to learn more about children up to three years of age.\n\"It's also important to keep up with the times and be well-informed and resourceful. It makes you more worthwhile in the market and you can impart new things to the children.\""}
