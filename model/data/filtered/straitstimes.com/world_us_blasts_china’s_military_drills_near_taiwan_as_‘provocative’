Taiwan, however, rejects China\u2019s sovereignty claims.\nChina\u2019s military said on Sunday it conducted the drills in response to escalating \u201ccollusion and provocations\u201d from Taiwan and the US.\nLast week, US lawmakers agreed to a US$1.7 trillion (S$2.29 trillion) spending Bill that included US$2 billion in weapons funding for Taiwan.\nChina\u2019s Defence Ministry has blasted the US National Defence Authorisation Act, which permits up to US$10 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan, for playing up the China threat and interfering in the nation\u2019s internal affairs.
