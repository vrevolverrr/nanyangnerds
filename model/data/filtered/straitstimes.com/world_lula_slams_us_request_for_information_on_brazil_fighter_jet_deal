The case was tossed out by Brazil's Supreme Court in 2022.\nSaab said in its Thursday statement that Brazilian and Swedish investigations into the procurement process had been closed without indicating any wrongdoing by the firm.\nLula noted he initially intended to buy Dassault's Rafale fighter, but left the decision to Rousseff as he only had a few months left in his second term. He suggested the United States was unhappy with Brazil's \"sovereign\" choice.\n\"They didn't like it when I said I was going to buy the Rafale and certainly didn't like it when Dilma bought the Swedish aircraft, as they wanted us to buy the U.S. plane,\" the president said.\nThe agreement with Saab allowed Gripens to be produced in Brazil. Last year, Saab and Embraer launched a production line for the fighter at the Brazilian planemaker's Gaviao Peixoto plant.\nNEW PRESIDENTIAL PLANE\nLula also said he plans to buy a new presidential aircraft after his 20-year-old Airbus A319 jet faced an undisclosed technical problem this month during a flight from Mexico City to Brasilia.\nThe plane encountered issues after departing the Mexican capital and was forced to circle the area for hours to burn off fuel before landing safely at the airport it had just departed.\nLula said one of the engines had issues and passengers felt unusual vibrations.\n\"I have asked my defense minister to gather a proposal. We will buy a presidential airplane and also some other aircraft for ministers to travel on,\" he said. REUTERS"}
