US West Texas Intermediate futures were also up 0.7 per cent at US$74.21 a barrel, after surging more than 5 per cent on Oct 3. Both benchmarks were headed for weekly gains of about 9 per cent.\nCrude has soared this week as the escalation of tensions in the Middle East raised the possibility that supplies from the region, which accounts for about a third of the world\u2019s total, could be disrupted. Israel and Iran, as well as Tehran\u2019s proxies in Lebanon, Gaza and elsewhere, have been facing off for the past year, stoking concerns of an all-out conflict that could draw in the United States.\nIran is a member of the Opec oil cartel, producing around 3.2 million barrels per day, or 3 per cent of global output.\nIt fired a barrage of missiles into Israel earlier this week, after Israel stepped up its offensive against Tehran-backed Hezbollah, including sending its troops into southern Lebanon. On Oct 3, the US-led Group of Seven nations called on countries in the region \u201cto act responsibly and with restraint\u201d.\nCitigroup has estimated that a major strike by Israel on Iran\u2019s export capacity could take 1.5 million barrels of daily supply off the market. If Israel struck minor infrastructure, such as downstream assets, 300,000 to 450,000 barrels of output could be lost, it said.\nAnalysts have also expressed concern that Tehran could raise the stakes by targeting energy infrastructure in neighbouring states or supply routes, including the critical Strait of Hormuz.\nOil\u2019s jump \u2013 if sustained \u2013 may contribute to a resurgence in inflation just as many central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have started to ease interest rates after the pace of price gains ebbed. Costlier crude would over time feed through into higher petrol prices at the pump.\nBeyond the Middle East crisis, there are signs of ample supplies. Opec+ intends to restore some of its shuttered capacity, with increases set to start from December. Libya, meanwhile, has been restarting production, returning hundreds of thousands of barrels a day, after a political stand-off in the country eased. BLOOMBERG"}
