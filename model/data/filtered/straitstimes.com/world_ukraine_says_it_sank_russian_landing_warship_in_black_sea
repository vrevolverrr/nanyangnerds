The Kremlin declined to comment.\n\u201cThe Ukrainian armed forces, together with the Defence Ministry\u2019s intelligence unit, destroyed the Tsezar Kunikov large landing ship. It was in Ukraine\u2019s territorial waters near Alupka at the time of the hit,\u201d the military said on Telegram.\nThe Black Sea resort town of Alupka lies not far from Yalta on the southern edge of Crimea, which Russian forces seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\u201cToday, more security in the Black Sea and more motivation for our people were added. This is important. And step by step, we will clear the Black Sea of Russian terrorist objects,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.\nUkraine\u2019s GUR military intelligence agency said the warship appeared to have been loaded when it sank and, before the attack, it had spent some 10 days at a loading site used by the Russian military.\nIt published on Telegram grainy footage purporting to show several naval drones approaching a large vessel at night and at least one large explosion.\nReuters was able to verify the ship in the video as the Russian Black Sea Fleet\u2019s Caesar Kunikov based on its main mast, antenna, bridge and deck.\nThe location and date that the footage was filmed could not be independently verified.\nSome of the footage at the end appeared to show major damage, with the vessel listing heavily to one side.\n\u201cIn summary, Caesar Kunikov received a critical breach on the port side and started sinking,\u201d the GUR agency said in a statement.\nThe Project 775 warship, one of Russia\u2019s newest vessels, has a crew of 87 and took part in wars in Georgia, Syria and Ukraine, GUR said in its statement.\nA Ukrainian news outlet published several videos showing a column of smoke rising over the sea off the southern coast of Crimea with helicopters flying overhead.\nUkraine has used uncrewed navy drones packed with explosives to attack Russian warships to try to drive them out of parts of the Black Sea, making it possible for Ukraine to open a shipping corridor along a traditionally key export route.\nUkraine has no large naval ships left and deliberately scuttled its own flagship at the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion to prevent it from falling into Russian hands.\nNewly developed naval drones have been vital for Ukraine as it tries to narrow the vast gap in its naval capabilities with Russia, which has a powerful Black Sea Fleet that Kyiv has been trying to degrade.\nA senior US State Department official said the use of drones was \u201can asymmetrical way to rebalance the security picture in the Black Sea\u201d and was helping to grow Ukraine\u2019s economy to sustain the war effort.\n\u201cThe fact that the Russian navy cannot operate in the Black Sea at will, compared with how it could operate at the beginning of this war, is a fundamental shift in the strategic position in the Black Sea region,\u201d the official told reporters, requesting anonymity.\nA senior Ukrainian security official said in December that it had already destroyed 20 per cent of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.\nUkrainian Navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russia had five remaining large landing ships in the Black Sea.\nThe Ukrainian military said it has \u201cdestroyed\u201d 25 Russian military vessels and ships and one submarine during the war to date.\nIn January, Ukrainian cruise missiles struck another large Russian landing warship in Crimea.
