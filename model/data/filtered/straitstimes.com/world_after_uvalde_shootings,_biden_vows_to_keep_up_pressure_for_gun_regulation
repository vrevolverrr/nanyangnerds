That's my hope.\"\nA bipartisan group of US lawmakers has been working through the Memorial Day weekend to pursue possible areas of compromise.\nThey reportedly were focusing on laws to raise the age for gun purchases or to allow police to remove guns from people deemed at risk \u2013 but not on an outright ban on high-powered rifles like the weapon used last Tuesday in Uvalde, Texas or the one used 10 days earlier in Buffalo, New York.\nA day earlier, the President visited the Texas town of Uvalde, where grieving mourners were holding their first wakes for 19 children and two teachers killed by a teen gunman last week in a shooting at their elementary school.\nThe first funerals are set for Tuesday, with others scheduled through mid-June. The huge number of victims, many with horrific wounds, has left the town\u2019s two funeral homes turning to embalmers and morticians from across Texas for help.\nOne anonymous donor has pledged US$175,000 (S$240,000) to help cover funeral costs, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.\nAt one of the funeral homes \u2013 just across the street from Robb Elementary School where the shooting occurred \u2013 friends, family and strangers attended a closed-casket visitation for 10-year-old shooting victim Amerie Jo Garza. Pictures of the young girl decorated the space.\nMs Esther Rubio, who described the scene as \u201cvery sombre,\u201d came from nearby San Antonio with her husband.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say, because there\u2019s no words to describe (it),\u201d she said.\nThe massacre was the deadliest school attack since 20 children and six staff were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012.\nIt came less than two weeks after another mass shooting, in Buffalo, New York, where 10 people died in an attack targeting African Americans, allegedly by a self-described white supremacist.\nWhile mass shootings draw anguished attention and spur momentary demands for change, most US gun violence passes with scant notice.\nThe country\u2019s Memorial Day weekend \u2013 Monday is a national holiday \u2013 has been marked by yet more graphic violence.\nAt least 126 gun deaths and 317 injuries were recorded nationwide from Saturday to Monday afternoon, according to the Gun Violence Archive website.\nGun-control advocates hoped the shock over the Uvalde tragedy, coming even as people in Buffalo were burying victims of the attack there, might finally prompt politicians to act.\nCongress has repeatedly failed to agree on tighter gun regulations despite the grim recurrence of mass shootings, but the latest killings in the country's epidemic of gun violence have sparked a push for new measures.\nKey lawmakers expressed guarded optimism on Sunday for reform, in a country with a thriving gun culture where guns outnumber people.\nOpposition to gun control runs deep among Republicans and some Democrats representing rural states.\n\"There are more Republicans interested in talking about finding a path forward this time than I have seen since Sandy Hook,\" Democratic Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told local TV on Sunday, adding that \"serious negotiations\" were under way with members of both parties.\nMr Biden said Monday he is deliberately \"not negotiating with any of the Republicans yet\". \"I know what happened when we had rational action before\" on gun regulation. \"It did significantly cut down mass murders.\"\nMourners in Uvalde \u2013 a mostly Latino town of 15,000 about an hour\u2019s drive from the Mexican border \u2013 have echoed calls for change.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if this child cannot even sip a glass of wine because he\u2019s too young, then guess what? He\u2019s too young to purchase a firearm,\u201d said Ms Pamela Ellis, who travelled from Houston to pay her respects."}
