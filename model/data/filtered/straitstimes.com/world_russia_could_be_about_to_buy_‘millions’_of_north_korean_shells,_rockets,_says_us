That\u2019s what our information gives us \u2013 it could be on that scale.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any indication that the purchase has actually occurred yet so it\u2019s difficult to say what it\u2019s actually going to end up looking like,\u201d Kirby added.\nHe said it was \u201cjust another indication of how desperate Putin is becoming... It\u2019s an indication of how much his defence industrial establishment is suffering as a result of this war and the degree of desperation.\u201d\nUS officials said additional Russian purchases of North Korean military equipment were expected.\nUkraine recently launched counteroffensives in several locations. In preparation for those attacks, Ukrainian forces struck Russian supply areas, including those containing artillery and ammunition.\nOfficials have said Western sanctions are limiting Russia\u2019s ability to replace vehicles and weapons destroyed in Ukraine.\nNorth Korea\u2019s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNorth Korea experts said Pyongyang is keen to raise money from weapons sales to counter international sanctions, which Russia in the past has supported, over its nuclear and missile programmes.\nVedant said the Russian purchases would violate UN sanctions that prohibit UN member states from procuring arms from North Korea.\n\u201cParticularly concerning here is that a permanent member of the Security Council is flouting these measures,\u201d he said, referring to Russia.\nAlastair Morgan, Britain\u2019s ambassador to North Korea from 2015 to 2018 and who was also coordinator for the UN Panel of Experts that monitors enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, told a webinar he had no information to verify the report about Russian purchases, but added: \u201cIf it could, I\u2019m quite sure that (North Korea) would sell arms to whoever would take them.\u201d\nHe noted that Pyongyang had repeatedly expressed support for Russia in Ukraine and clearly wanted to remain on good terms with Russia, as well as China, so they would continue to block any further UN Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang."}
