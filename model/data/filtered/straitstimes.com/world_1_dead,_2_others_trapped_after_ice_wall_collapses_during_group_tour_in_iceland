The best time to visit is in winter, according to Adventures.is, an Icelandic tour operator.\nIcelandic online newspaper V\u00edsir reported that tourism companies that had signed a contract with the national park were authorised to organise ice cave trips and glacier walks year-round, and that the park \u201ctrusts companies to assess the conditions\u201d.
