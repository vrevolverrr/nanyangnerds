Poland and the European Union have accused Belarus and Russia of trying to spread chaos since 2021 by pushing migrants over the frontier in what Warsaw calls a \u201chybrid war\u201d. Minsk and Moscow have dismissed the accusations.\nThe numbers of people arriving have been rising recently, according to Polish government figures.\nAnd this week, what Poland sees as a war had a casualty when a soldier patrolling the border died after succumbing to his wounds from a confrontation with migrants on May 28.\nIn response, the centrist, pro-EU government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk has announced plans to re-introduce a no-go zone along the frontier.\n\u201cThis border is not safe, unfortunately. The purpose of this zone is to ensure that no one is exposed to the type of attack that Polish soldiers are exposed to,\u201d Deputy Defence Minister Pawel Zalewski told Reuters.\nBack at the fence on June 3, the group kept waiting. Mr Ahmed Lebek, 24, from Aleppo, Syria, said he had been there for more than a month. His brother had given up and gone back to Belarus, though he had had no news from him since.\n\u201cI come from the war to find a good life. But I found it very hard to cross this border,\u201d said Mr Ahmed, 35, an English teacher from Syria. He had tried four times to climb the fence.\nUnder current arrangements, migrants can apply for asylum in EU member Poland once they are on Polish soil.\nOne of them who made it across the fence a day later was Mr Noaman Al-Hemyari, a 24-year-old graphic designer from Yemen.\nIn the forest on the Polish side of the border, he told Reuters he and others had built a ladder from wood, fabric scraps and plastic bags, and used it to scale the barrier when darkness fell.\nHe had originally applied for a Polish student visa from Yemen, which was rejected, before travelling to Moscow, then Belarus and later the border area, where he had spent 22 days.\n\u201cWe had been caught by the Belarusians. They hit us... Then they said \u2018go\u2019,\u201d Mr Noaman said, visibly relieved and with leaves still in his hair.\n\u201cThey (smugglers) said it\u2019s so easy... They lied to us. If I had any idea it\u2019s like this, I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d"}
