Inouye Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies, said hosting Mr Putin could affect this.\n\u201cI think the Putin visit makes Vietnam less trustful in the eyes of the US, and may negatively affect the US decision,\u201d he said.\nThe upgrade Hanoi seeks is opposed by US steelmakers, Gulf Coast shrimpers and honey farmers, but backed by retailers and some other business groups. It would reduce punitive anti-dumping duties set on Vietnamese imports, given its current status as a non-market economy marked by heavy state influence.\nSpeaking to reporters on June 20, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did not reply when asked if Vietnam\u2019s closer ties with Moscow would affect the upcoming US Commerce Department decision.\nShe said Washington saw Vietnam as a partner in efforts to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on China. She added the upgraded partnership did not require Vietnam to sever ties with Russia or China and that Hanoi has a policy of working with many countries.\nThe Treasury on June 20 kept Vietnam on its monitoring list for currency practices, but said it was satisfied with progress made by the country and would stay in close touch with its central bank.\nIn its semi-annual report on foreign exchange markets, the Treasury said Vietnam\u2019s net purchases of foreign exchange in the four quarters to December 2023 were US$7 billion (S$9.5 billion) or 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, below a 2 per cent Treasury threshold for manipulation. It said Vietnam did not intervene persistently throughout the year to support its currency and made only moderate purchases of foreign exchange despite significant depreciation pressure on the dong.\nThe Treasury said Vietnam\u2019s bilateral goods and services trade surplus with the United States reached US$103 billion in the reporting period, the third-largest surplus.
