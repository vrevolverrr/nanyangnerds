Observers said this could be because some of the novelty associated with the brand has waned, and stronger competition from other EV brands.\nThe trend is not unique to Singapore. Reuters reported in April that Tesla\u2019s share of EV sales in California \u2013 one of its sales strongholds \u2013 had fallen to 59.6 per cent in the first quarter, down from 72.7 per cent for full-year 2022. This was despite the EV maker having cut prices six times in the year.\nThis prompted Tesla to start advertising for the first time in its 20-year history, with the first ad \u2013 a video \u2013 featuring Singapore.\nAccording to the LTA figures, 1,462 electric cars were registered in the first five months of 2023, accounting for 13.4 per cent of total registrations \u2013 up slightly from 11.7 per cent in 2022.\nThere were 7,961 electric cars on the road as at end-May, accounting for just 1.2 per cent of the total car population.\nFor the first time, LTA had itemised parallel import registrations. Parallel imports are vehicles sold by non-authorised retailers, who source their cars from dealers in overseas markets.\nIn the first five months of 2023, parallel imports accounted for 21.7 per cent of car registrations, holding steady from 20.6 per cent in 2022. Their share of Toyota sales grew, while their share of Mercedes-Benz sales fell.\nParallel importers, however, have a far weaker hold of the EV market, with only a 1.6 per cent share compared with 17.1 per cent by authorised agents.\nMr Neo Nam Heng, chairman of diversified motor group Prime, said there were three main reasons for this.\n\u201cOne, the Japanese domestic models, which parallel importers target, have a different charging system. Two, many of the manufacturers are not able to provide total power output figures required by the authorities here. And three, a lack of back-up technical service,\u201d he said.\nMost of the European EVs come with periodic software updates, which are done over the air. These updates are not available to most parallel imported cars."}
