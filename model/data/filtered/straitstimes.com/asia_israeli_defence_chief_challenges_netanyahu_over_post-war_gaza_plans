The key to this goal is military action, and the establishment of a governing alternative in Gaza,\u201d Mr Gallant said.\n\u201cIn the absence of such an alternative, only two negative options remain: Hamas\u2019 rule in Gaza or Israeli military rule in Gaza,\u201d he added, saying he would oppose the latter scenario and urging Mr Netanyahu to formally forswear it.\nMr Gallant said that, since October, he had tried to promote a plan to set up a \u201cnon-hostile Palestinian governing alternative\u201d to Hamas - but got no response from the Israeli Cabinet.\nThe format of his broadside, a pre-announced news conference carried live by Israeli TV and radio, recalled Mr Gallant\u2019s bombshell warning in March 2023 that foment over a judicial overhaul pursued by Mr Netanyahu was threatening military cohesion.\nAt the time, Mr Netanyahu announced that Mr Gallant would be fired - but backed down amid a deluge of street demonstrations.\nSome defence analysts believe Mr Gallant\u2019s prediction was borne out by Hamas\u2019 ability to blindside Israeli forces a few months later.\nAsked on May 15 whether he was worried he may again face being ousted, Mr Gallant said: \u201cI\u2019m not blaming anyone. In a democratic country, I believe, it\u2019s appropriate for a person, especially the defence minister who holds a position, to make it public.\u201d\nMr Gallant\u2019s Gaza criticism recalled that of Israel\u2019s chief ally, the US, which has sought to parlay the war into a role for the internationally backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which wields limited governance in the occupied West Bank.\nMr Netanyahu has refused this, describing the PA as a hostile entity - and repeated this position in a video statement he issued on social media within an hour of Mr Gallant\u2019s remarks.\nAny move to create an alternative Gaza government requires that Hamas first be eliminated, Mr Netanyahu said, finishing with the demand that this objective be pursued \u201cwithout excuses\u201d."}
