Do it to protect yourself and don\u2019t listen too much to the rumours circulating outside,\u201d he added.\nMr Ong, an MP for Sembawang GRC, said some seniors had asked him about rumours regarding serious reactions caused by vaccines when he spoke to residents at the Sembawang Central Community Garden Gala - One Community Fiesta event.\nMore than 250 residents attended the event organised by Sembawang Central Grassroots Organisations and the People\u2019s Association Integration Council.\nMr Ong also said Singapore is ready to step up Covid-19 measures when necessary to lower infection rates and protect the unvaccinated.\nHe added that while such restrictions as the VDS, which was aimed at protecting the unvaccinated in crowded areas, had pushed many to get vaccinated, it is better to step down the VDS as it is now not as extensive.\n\u201cToday VDS is very light and in restaurants is pretty much an honesty system with random sporadic enforcement,\u201d said Mr Ong.\n\"It's not that VDS doesn't work. In its current form, which is light, I think it doesn't work as well. So we might as well step it down with the understanding that we can step up to an appropriate level when we really need it.\"\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Oct 7 that VDS will no longer be required for events with more than 500 participants, nightlife establishments where there is dancing, and dining at food and beverage establishments, including hawker centres.\nMr Ong said: \u201cCome December, we don\u2019t know what kind of variant will come up or what kind of variant will arrive in Singapore. If it\u2019s something dangerous, we don\u2019t want to be caught off guard.\n\u201cSo now, while we have the time and the space, get ourselves properly vaccinated with the bivalent vaccines. It is the best protection for us for whatever may come in December.\u201d\nThe use of the bivalent vaccine to replace the current formulation has been recommended by the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination, MOH said on Oct 7.\nThe ministry added that it will replace the original Moderna/Spikevax vaccine with the updated bivalent version from Oct 17, and this will be for all adults aged 18 and above.\nMr Ong also said the Government has been transparent about the reactions caused by vaccines, with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) publishing the severe adverse reaction incidents every three months.\nHe added that such cases mostly recover by themselves and that while there are risks to every type of vaccination, this has to be weighed against the cost of remaining unvaccinated."}
