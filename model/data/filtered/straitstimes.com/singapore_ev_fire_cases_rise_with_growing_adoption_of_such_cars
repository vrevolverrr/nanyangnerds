For instance, data from the US National Transport Safety Board found that EV fires averaged 25.1 fires per 100,000 sales \u2013 compared with 3,474 for hybrids and 1,529 for combustion engine vehicles.\nExperts here warn against drawing conclusions from the Singapore figures as the numbers are too small to yield statistically reliable inferences from.\nDr Zafar Momin, an adjunct associate professor at the National University of Singapore Business School, said: \u201cCurrently, the data on EVs in Singapore is very limited and it is hard to draw generalisations based on such a small sample size.\u201d\nHe said data in the United States, which has a much larger vehicle and EV population, showed that EVs were \u201cfar less prone to catching fire\u201d than other vehicles.\nHe added, however, that \u201cwhen comparing across countries, there are many other factors that influence the comparative statistics such as accuracy of data, average vehicle age and mileage, driver profiles and driving conditions\u201d.\nGeneral Insurance Association (GIA) chief executive Ho Kai Weng said: \u201cThe sample of one and two is not statistically meaningful to draw conclusions. Insurers seem to be taking the view that they don\u2019t have enough dataset for Singapore EVs for now for any sort of modelling.\u201d\nEven so, The Straits Times understands at least one major insurer has an EV policy which covers fire risks. Singlife\u2019s Prestige package pays 110 per cent of an EV\u2019s market value at time of loss caused by \u201cfire or explosion during charging\u201d.\nAccording to the SCDF, all the EV fires took place when the vehicles were on the move. The firefighting agency said that it is equipped to deal with EV fires.\n\u201cNotwithstanding the relatively low number of EV fires, SCDF is aware and prepared for the unique challenges of fires involving EVs, such as the risk of a thermal runaway involving the high-voltage battery,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\u201cWater is the recommended medium for EV firefighting by manufacturers and organisations such as the US National Fire Protection Association,\u201d the spokesman added.\n\u201cStudies indicate that the application of water to extinguish EV fires poses a low risk of electric shock to responders. Nevertheless, we are mindful of the risk, particularly if responders are required to cut into the vehicle to extricate casualties.\u201d\nIn November 2022, the SCDF introduced a vehicle fire blanket, which can effectively suffocate a conventional car fire. \u201cIf used in tandem with a firefighting water stream penetrating into the high-voltage battery, this can extinguish an EV-related fire,\u201d the spokesman said.\nMeanwhile, members of the public are advised not to try to fight a fire if it spreads quickly or engulfs a vehicle, especially if it involves an EV. \u201cIn such instances, they are advised to retreat to a safe distance and call 995 for assistance,\u201d the SCDF advised."}
